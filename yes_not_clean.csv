0,5609,"Phase 2 bioadjuvant study of interferon alfa-2a, isotretinoin, and vitamin E in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: long-term follow-up.",Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,15837897,"Among the 45 patients treated under the protocol, only 7 patients (16%) had died. Nine (20%) of 45 patients experienced progressive disease. Only 1 second primary tumor (acute promyelocytic leukemia) occurred during follow-up, and no aerodigestive second primary tumors occurred among the 45 patients. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival percentages were 80% (95% confidence interval, 65.1%-89.1%) and 81.3% (95% confidence interval, 63.7%-90.9%), respectively. These results are significantly better than the historical 5-year overall survival for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (approximately 40%). Forty-five patients entered this study. All patients had stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and had been treated with surgical resection, radiation, or both. All patients were then treated with bioadjuvant chemopreventive treatment for 12 months. We previously reported a 24-month median follow-up of this phase 2 trial of the combination of isotretinoin, interferon alfa-2a, and vitamin E as bioadjuvant therapy after definitive local therapy. In that study, all 45 patients completed treatment, but 1 patient was excluded from analysis of recurrence and development of second primary tumors. Main Outcome Measure Longer-term (49.4-month median) follow-up. Tertiary care academic medical centers. Phase 2 prospective study. To evaluate the long-term effects of the combination of isotretinoin, interferon alfa-2a, and vitamin E in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The bioadjuvant combination is highly effective in preventing recurrence and second primary tumors, and its role as standard therapy in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is being investigated in a randomized phase 3 study.

1,5651,Gum chewing reduces ileus after elective open sigmoid colectomy.,"Archives of surgery (Chicago, Ill. : 1960)",16490895,"Gum chewing after elective open colon resection may stimulate bowel motility and decrease duration of postoperative ileus. Prospective, randomized study in a community-based teaching hospital. Thirty-four patients undergoing elective open sigmoid resections for recurrent diverticulitis or cancer. First feelings of hunger, time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, length of hospital stay, and complications. A total of 34 patients were randomized into 2 groups: a gum-chewing group (n = 17) or a control group (n = 17). The patients in the gum-chewing group chewed sugarless gum 3 times daily for 1 hour each time until discharge. Patient demographics, intraoperative, and postoperative care were equivalent between the 2 groups. All gum-chewing patients tolerated the gum. The first passage of flatus occurred on postoperative hour 65.4 in the gum-chewing group and on hour 80.2 in the control group (P = .05). The first bowel movement occurred on postoperative hour 63.2 in the gum-chewing group and on hour 89.4 in the control group (P = .04). The first feelings of hunger were felt on postoperative hour 63.5 in the gum-chewing group and on hour 72.8 in the control group (P = .27). There were no major complications in either group. The total length of hospital stay was shorter in the gum-chewing group (day 4.3) than in the control group (day 6.8), (P = .01). Gum chewing speeds recovery after elective open sigmoid resection by stimulating bowel motility. Gum chewing is an inexpensive and helpful adjunct to postoperative care after colectomy.

2,5892,Phytoestrogen supplements for the treatment of hot flashes: the Isoflavone Clover Extract (ICE) Study: a randomized controlled trial.,JAMA,12851275,"Although the study provides some evidence for a biological effect of Promensil, neither supplement had a clinically important effect on hot flashes or other symptoms of menopause. Of 252 participants, 246 (98%) completed the 12-week protocol. The reductions in mean daily hot flash count at 12 weeks were similar for the Promensil (5.1), Rimostil (5.4), and placebo (5.0) groups. In comparison with the placebo group, participants in the Promensil group (41%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-51%; P =.03), but not in the Rimostil group (34%; 95% CI, 22%-46%; P =.74) reduced hot flashes more rapidly. Quality-of-life improvements and adverse events were comparable in the 3 groups. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of menopausal women, aged 45 to 60 years, who were experiencing at least 35 hot flashes per week. The study was conducted between November 1999 and March 2001 at 3 US medical centers and included women who were recently postmenopausal (mean [SD], 3.3 [4.5] years since menopause) experiencing 8.1 hot flashes per day. Women were excluded if they were vegetarians, consumed soy products more than once per week, or took medications affecting isoflavone absorption. Clinical trials demonstrating increased risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer among women randomized to hormone replacement therapy have increased interest in other therapies for menopausal symptoms. Dietary supplements containing isoflavones are widely used as alternatives to hormonal therapies for hot flashes, but there is a paucity of data supporting their efficacy. The primary outcome measure was the change in frequency of hot flashes measured by participant daily diaries. Secondary outcome measures included changes in quality of life and adverse events. To compare the efficacy and safety of 2 dietary supplements derived from red clover with placebo in symptomatic menopausal women. After a 2-week placebo run-in, 252 participants were randomly assigned to Promensil (82 mg of total isoflavones per day), Rimostil (57 mg of total isoflavones per day), or an identical placebo, and followed-up for 12 weeks.

3,5927,Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of colorectal cancer: the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial.,JAMA,16467233,"Invasive colorectal cancer incidence. A total of 480 incident cases of invasive colorectal cancer occurred during a mean follow-up of 8.1 (SD, 1.7) years. Intervention group participants significantly reduced their percentage of energy from fat by 10.7% more than did the comparison group at 1 year, and this difference between groups was mostly maintained (8.1% at year 6). Statistically significant increases in vegetable, fruit, and grain servings were also made. Despite these dietary changes, there was no evidence that the intervention reduced the risk of invasive colorectal cancer during the follow-up period. There were 201 women with invasive colorectal cancer (0.13% per year) in the intervention group and 279 (0.12% per year) in the comparison group (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.90-1.29). Secondary analyses suggested potential interactions with baseline aspirin use and combined estrogen-progestin use status (P = .01 for each). Colorectal examination rates, although not protocol defined, were comparable between the intervention and comparison groups. Similar results were seen in analyses adjusting for adherence to the intervention. In this study, a low-fat dietary pattern intervention did not reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women during 8.1 years of follow-up. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00000611.

Participants were randomly assigned to the dietary modification intervention (n = 19,541; 40%) or the comparison group (n = 29,294; 60%). The intensive behavioral modification program aimed to motivate and support reductions in dietary fat, to increase consumption of vegetables and fruits, and to increase grain servings by using group sessions, self-monitoring techniques, and other tailored and targeted strategies. Women in the comparison group continued their usual eating pattern.

Women were enrolled between 1995 and 2000 and followed up through June 1, 2006. The intervention group (n = 1537) was randomly assigned to receive a telephone counseling program supplemented with cooking classes and newsletters that promoted daily targets of 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice; 3 fruit servings; 30 g of fiber; and 15% to 20% of energy intake from fat. The comparison group (n = 1551) was provided with print materials describing the ""5-A-Day"" dietary guidelines. Invasive breast cancer event (recurrence or new primary) or death from any cause.

5,7794,Psychosocial interventions for informal caregivers of people living with cancer.,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,31204791,"Increasingly, cancer is recognised as a chronic condition with a growing population of informal caregivers providing care for cancer patients. Informal caregiving can negatively affect the health and well-being of caregivers. We need a synthesised account of best evidence to aid decision-making about effective ways to support caregivers for individuals 'living with cancer'. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions delivered to adult informal caregivers of adults affected by cancer on a group or individual basis with usual care. Psychosocial interventions included non-pharmacological interventions that involved an interpersonal relationship between caregivers and healthcare professionals. We included interventions delivered also to caregiver-patient dyads. Interventions delivered to caregivers of individuals receiving palliative or inpatient care were excluded. Our primary outcome was caregiver QoL. Secondary outcomes included patient QoL, caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health status and intervention satisfaction and adverse effects. Pairs of review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. We synthesised findings using meta-analysis, where possible, and reported remaining results in a narrative synthesis. Nineteen trials (n = 3, 725) were included in the review. All trials were reported in English and were undertaken in high-income countries. Trials targeted caregivers of patients affected by a number of cancers spanning newly diagnosed patients, patients awaiting treatment, patients who were being treated currently and individuals post-treatment. Most trials delivered interventions to caregiver-patient dyads (predominantly spousal dyads) and there was variation in intervention delivery to groups or individual participants. There was much heterogeneity across interventions though the majority were defined as psycho-educational. All trials were rated as being at 'high risk of bias'.Compared to usual care, psychosocial interventions may improve slightly caregiver QoL immediately post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.53; studies = 2, 265 participants) and may have little to no effect on caregiver QoL at 12 months (SMD 0.14, 95% CI - 0.11 to 0.40; studies = 2, 239 participants) post-intervention (both low-quality evidence).Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on caregiver depression immediately to one-month post-intervention (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.15; studies = 9, 702 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver anxiety immediately post-intervention (SMD -0.12, 95 % CI -0.33 to 0.10; studies = 5, 329 participants), depression three-to-six months (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.38; studies = 5. 379 participants) post-intervention and patient QoL six to 12 months (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.26; studies = 3, 294 participants) post-intervention (all low-quality evidence). There was uncertainty whether psychosocial interventions improve patient QoL immediately (SMD -0.03, 95 %CI -0.50 to 0.44; studies = 2, 292 participants) or caregiver anxiety three-to-six months (SMD-0.25, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.13; studies = 4, 272 participants) post-intervention (both very low-quality evidence). Two studies which could not be pooled in a meta-analysis for caregiver physical health status found little to no effect immediately post-intervention and a small intervention effect 12 months post-intervention. Caregiver or patient satisfaction or cost-effectiveness of interventions were not assessed in any studies. Interventions demonstrated good feasibility and acceptability.Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on patient physical health status immediately post-intervention (SMD 0.17, 95 % CI -0.07 to 0.41; studies = 4, 461 participants) and patient depression three to six months post-intervention (SMD-0.11, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.12; studies = 6, 534 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence).Psychosocial interventions may have little to no effect on caregiver psychological distress immediately to one-month (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.26; studies = 3, 134 participants), and seven to 12 months (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.58; studies = 2, 62 participants) post-intervention; patient depression immediately (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.07; studies = 9, 852 participants); anxiety immediately (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.15;studies = 4, 422 participants), and three to six months (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.02; studies = 4, 370 participants); psychological distress immediately (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.44; studies = 2, 74 participants) and seven to 12 months (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.24; studies = 2, 61 participants); and physical health status six to 12 months (SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.30; studies = 2, 275 participants) post-intervention (all low-quality evidence).Three trials reported adverse effects associated with the interventions, compared with usual care, including higher distress, sexual function-related distress and lower relationship satisfaction levels for caregivers, higher distress levels for patients, and that some content was perceived as insensitive to some participants.Trials not able to be pooled in a meta-analysis did not tend to report effect size and it was difficult to discern intervention effectiveness. Variable intervention effects were reported for patient and caregiver outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open SIGLE, Web of Science from inception up to January 2018, trial registries and citation lists of included studies. To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to improve the quality of life (QoL), physical health and well-being of informal caregivers of people living with cancer compared with usual care. Heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for this population. There is an immediate need for rigorous trials with process evaluations and clearer, detailed intervention descriptions. Cost-effectiveness studies should be conducted alongside future trials.

6,9064,Patient navigation for lung cancer screening among current smokers in community health centers a randomized controlled trial.,Cancer medicine,29464877,"Annual chest computed tomography (CT) can decrease lung cancer mortality in high-risk individuals. Patient navigation improves cancer screening rates in underserved populations. Randomized controlled trial was conducted from February 2016 to January 2017 to evaluate the impact of a patient navigation program on lung cancer screening (LCS) among current smokers in five community health centers (CHCs) affiliated with an academic primary care network. We randomized 1200 smokers aged 55-77 years to intervention (n = 400) or usual care (n = 800). Navigators contacted patients to determine LCS eligibility, introduce shared decision making about screening, schedule appointments with primary care physicians (PCPs), and help overcome barriers to obtaining screening and follow-up. Control patients received usual care. The main outcome was the proportion of patients who had any chest CT. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients contacted, proportion receiving LCS CTs, screening results and number of lung cancers diagnosed. Of the 400 intervention patients, 335 were contacted and 76 refused participation. Of the 259 participants, 124 (48%) were ineligible for screening; 119 had smoked <30 pack-years, and five had competing comorbidities. Among the 135 eligible participants in the intervention group, 124 (92%) had any chest CT performed. In intention-to-treat analyses, 124 intervention patients (31%) had any chest CT versus 138 control patients (17.3%, P < 0.001). LCS CTs were performed in 94 intervention patients (23.5%) versus 69 controls (8.6%, P < 0.001). A total of 20% of screened patients required follow-up. Lung cancer was diagnosed in eight intervention (2%) and four control (0.5%) patients. A patient navigation program implemented in CHCs significantly increased LCS among high-risk current smokers.

7,9539,Psychological adjustment and sleep quality in a randomized trial of the effects of a Tibetan yoga intervention in patients with lymphoma.,Cancer,15139072,"Eighty nine percent of TY participants completed at least 2-3 three yoga sessions, and 58% completed at least 5 sessions. Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; P < 0.004). This included better subjective sleep quality (P < 0.02), faster sleep latency (P < 0.01), longer sleep duration (P < 0.03), and less use of sleep medications (P < 0.02). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance, state anxiety, depression, or fatigue. Research suggests that stress-reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life. Yoga, an ancient Eastern science, incorporates stress-reduction techniques that include regulated breathing, visual imagery, and meditation as well as various postures. The authors examined the effects of the Tibetan yoga (TY) practices of Tsa lung and Trul khor, which incorporate controlled breathing and visualization, mindfulness techniques, and low-impact postures in patients with lymphoma. Thirty-nine patients with lymphoma who were undergoing treatment or who had concluded treatment within the past 12 months were assigned to a TY group or to a wait-list control group. Patients in the TY group participated in 7 weekly yoga sessions, and patients in the wait-list control group were free to participate in the TY program after the 3-month follow-up assessment. The participation rates suggested that a TY program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep-related outcomes. However, there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes.

8,9648,Evaluation of shark cartilage in patients with advanced cancer: a North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial.,Cancer,15912493,"The study was a two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial. Patients with incurable breast or colorectal carcinoma had to have good performance status and organ function. Patients could be receiving chemotherapy. Patients were all to receive standard care and then to be randomly selected to receive either a shark cartilage product or an identical-appearing and smelling placebo 3 to 4 times each day. Shark cartilage has been a popular complementary or alternative medicine intervention. The basis for this popularity is the claim that sharks rarely get cancer because of the high proportion of cartilage in the shark's body. However, early studies were equivocal. Therefore, a clinical trial was conducted to look at the impact of shark cartilage in patients with advanced cancer. The primary goal of this trial was to determine whether a shark cartilage product improved overall survival for patients with advanced cancer who were getting standard care. Secondary research goals were to evaluate toxicities, tolerability, and quality of life associated with this shark cartilage product. This trial was unable to demonstrate any suggestion of efficacy for this shark cartilage product in patients with advanced cancer. Data on a total of 83 evaluable patients were analyzed. There was no difference in overall survival between patients receiving standard care plus a shark cartilage product versus standard care plus placebo. Likewise, there was no suggestion of improvement in quality of life for patients receiving the shark cartilage, compared with those receiving placebo.

Participants completing the intervention demonstrated improvement in male overall distress (P < 0.01), male global sexual function (P < 0.0001), and female global sexual function (P < 0.05) at 3-month follow-up, but regression toward baseline was noted at 6-month follow-up. However, utilization of ED treatments increased from 31% at the time of study entry to 49% at the 6-month follow-up (P = 0.003). The majority of prostate carcinoma survivors experience enduring sexual difficulties and associated distress in the years after definitive treatment. A counseling intervention aimed at improving levels of sexual satisfaction and increasing successful utilization of medical treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) was developed and pilot-tested for both the survivor of prostate carcinoma and his partner. All male participants were 3-month to 5-year survivors of localized prostate carcinoma who had been treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, and were married or in a committed relationship. Couples were randomized to attend four sessions of counseling together or to have the man attend alone. In both groups, partners completed behavioral homework. The sessions included education on prostate carcinoma and sexual function and options to treat ED as well as sexual communication and stimulation skills. Standardized questionnaires at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessed sexual function, marital adjustment, psychologic distress, and utilization of treatments for ED. The results of this brief pilot counseling intervention demonstrated significant gains in sexual function and satisfaction and increased utilization of treatments for ED.

Nail and skin toxicities were assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3) and compared using a 2-sample Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test adjusted for tied values. Onycholysis occurs in approximately 30% of patients treated with docetaxel. The efficacy and safety of an Elasto-Gel frozen sock (FS) was investigated for the prevention of docetaxel-induced nail and skin toxicity of the feet. Fifty consecutive patients were included between April 2005 and January 2007. Nail toxicity was significantly lower in the FS-protected foot compared with the control foot (grade 0: 100% versus 79%; and grade 1 and 2: 0% versus 21%, respectively) (P= .002). Skin toxicity was grade 0: 98% versus 94%; and grade 1 and 2: 2% versus 6% in the FS-protected and the control feet, respectively.

Within 12 months after the mailing, 18.7% of the women who had received the brush, participated by returning a self-sample sample, while 10.6% women allocated to the opt- in group did so. 10.5% women who received the standard recall letter, had a PAP smear taken within a period of 12 months; while 8% women did so without receiving an intervention at all. Participation in postmenopausal women was higher than in women younger than 50 in both self-sampling arms. Screening by means of the self-sample kit increased by age, contradictory when screening is performed by a PAP smear. Of those testing hrHPV positive (9.5%), 88.9% attended for follow up cytology. The mean DNA concentration, found in the self-sampler, decreased by age, causing a higher number of inconclusive results. Our results support the efficacy of a self-sampling strategy to increase participation in the Flemish screening program. Self-sampling seems particularly acceptable to postmenopausal non-responders. Future research should focus on the performance of different self-sampling devices in post-menopausal women as low DNA concentrations exponentially increased over age.

Here, we report the longer-term follow-up of patient-reported outcomes, health-related fitness and exercise behavior at 6, 12 and 24 months postintervention. A multicenter trial in Canada randomized 301 breast cancer patients initiating chemotherapy to thrice weekly, supervised exercise consisting of a standard dose of 25-30 min of aerobic exercise (STAN; n = 96), a higher dose of 50-60 min of aerobic exercise (HIGH; n = 101) or a combined dose of 50-60 min of aerobic and resistance exercise (COMB; n = 104) performed for the duration of chemotherapy (median of 17 weeks). Primary outcomes were patient-reported outcomes including quality of life, cancer-related symptoms and psychosocial outcomes. Secondary outcomes were objective health-related fitness (assessed at 12 months only) and self-reported exercise behavior. A total of 269 (89.4%) participants completed patient-reported outcomes at all three follow-up time points and 263 (87.4%) completed the health-related fitness assessment at 12-month follow-up. COMB was significantly superior to (i) STAN for sleep quality at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.027); (ii) HIGH for upper body muscular endurance at 12-month follow-up (p = 0.020); and (iii) HIGH for meeting the resistance exercise guideline at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.006). Moreover, self-reported meeting of the combined exercise guideline during follow-up was significantly associated with better patient-reported outcomes and health-related fitness. Performing combined exercise during and after breast cancer chemotherapy may result in better longer-term patient-reported outcomes and health-related fitness compared to performing aerobic exercise alone.

Treatment and control groups were similar in regards to diagnosis, gender, race, and age. The change in outcome measures over the year (T(1)-T(0)) was not significantly different between the two groups as assessed by a two-sample pooled t test. However, additional exploratory analyses indicated a significant gender difference in knowledge with female survivors in the intervention group having higher scores. In addition, patients who choose certain individual health goals, such as breast/testicular self-examination, showed improved practice of the health behavior. In addition, in a very exploratory analysis, a gender difference in response to the intervention was noted, with females exhibiting a greater improvement in knowledge scores than did males. Although the multi-behavioral educational intervention did not induce change in health knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of childhood cancer survivors for the treatment group as a whole, gender differences and specific health goal differences were found. These findings suggest that future interventions should be tailored to reflect gender differences and the nature of the health goal under assessment. Improved cure rates for childhood cancer have produced a growing population of survivors at risk for late toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Healthy behaviors can modify these risks. We initiated a controlled prospective trial to determine if a multi-component behavioral intervention could induce change in childhood cancer survivors' health knowledge, health perceptions, and practice of health-protective behaviors. Adolescent cancer survivors attending a long-term follow-up clinic were randomized to receive standard follow-up care or standard care plus the educational intervention.

Each patient received 45-min daily sessions for 10 consecutive days as a first step, but some of them required additional treatment. Based on these preliminary data, ST could be a good choice for adolescents with CIPN for whom pain control is difficult. ST caused total relief or dramatic reduction in CIPN pain and an improvement in quality of life, durable in follow-up. It caused no detected side effects, and can be retrained successfully. Further larger studies should be performed to confirm our promising preliminary data in pediatric patients with cancer. Pain significantly improved comparing Numeric Rate Scale after 10 days of ST (9.22 ± 0.83 vs. 2.33 ± 2.34; P < 0.001) and at the end of the optimized cycle (EOC) (9.22 ± 0.83 vs. 0.11 ± 0.33, P < 0.001).

Patients were block randomized to one of four consultation groups: 1. Standard care control--not audio-taped; 2. Audio-taped--no audiotape given; 3. Audio-taped--patient given audiotape; and 4. Audio-taped--patient offered choice of receiving audiotape or not (4 patients declined; 94 accepted). Patient outcomes were measured at 12 weeks post-consultation: perceived degree of information provision; audiotape satisfaction and use; communication satisfaction with oncologist; mood state; and cancer-specific quality of life. Patients receiving the consultation audiotape reported having been provided with significantly more disease and treatment information in general (p=0.04), and more information about treatment alternatives (p=0.04) and treatment side effects (p=0.01) in particular, than patients who did not receive the audiotape. Audiotape benefit was not significantly related to patient satisfaction with communication, mood state or quality of life at 12 weeks post-consultation, and was not significantly affected by choice of receiving the audiotape. Patients rated the audiotape intervention positively, with an average score of 83.0 out of 100. The purpose of this investigation was to systematically examine the efficacy of providing men with prostate cancer with an audiotape of their primary treatment consultation. Consultation audiotapes are rated highly by men with prostate cancer, and these audiotapes help to enhance their perception of having been provided with critical disease- and treatment-related information.

Video-conferencing after a short training course may be an effective strategy for delivering CST. Doctors in the intervention group displayed more creating environment and fewer blocking behaviours at both follow-ups; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Intervention doctors valued the training highly, but did not report substantial reductions in stress and burnout. Psychological morbidity in cancer patients is common, but often undetected and untreated. We developed a communication skills training (CST) program targeting this issue, and evaluated its impact on doctor behaviour. Thirty of 35 oncologists from six teaching hospitals in six Australian cities, participated. The CST was a 1.5-day intensive face-to-face workshop incorporating presentation of principles, a DVD modelling ideal behaviour and role-play practice, followed by four 1.5 h monthly video-conferences incorporating role-play of doctor-generated scenarios. Doctors were randomized to receive the CST or not. Simulated patient interviews were videotaped and coded at baseline, after CST and 6 months later.

A systematic search of four databases was conducted to identify articles published in English or Chinese from January 2000 to July 2013. Studies were located using an electronic search, a manual search and an author search. A total of 34 articles corresponding to 33 original studies were identified and included in this review. These interventions were classified under four broad categories according to their approaches: psycho-education (15), case management (13), exercise (4) and feedback of PRO (1). The PRO measures covered different types of PRO measures, including HRQOL, functional status, symptom status, overall well-being and satisfaction with care. Positive outcomes of more than 70% (24) out of these interventions were reported. These findings highlight the significant outcomes of cancer patient interventions that applied PRO measures to evaluate their outcomes. A theory-driven and careful design of the programme should be considered in the whole process of developing, delivering and assessing the programmes. Collaboration among patients, clinicians, researchers and policy makers is crucial to ensure the development of effective and accessible interventions targeting improving cancer survivors' HRQOL. With increasing expectations of a 5-year survival rate among cancer patients, there is growing interest in patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, particularly measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in cancer practice. The purpose of this review was to explore the existing interventions for patients coping with cancer in terms of intervention type, PRO measurements and outcomes; and to identify directions for future research.

Four main themes emerged from focus groups: (1) acceptability and satisfaction of Project MOVE, detailing the value of the model in developing tailored group-base PA programs; (2) the importance of Project MOVE leaders, highlighting the value of a leader that was organized and a good communicator; (3) breaking down barriers with Project MOVE, describing how the program helped to address common BC related barriers; and (4) motivation to MOVE, outlining how the microgrants enabled survivors to be active, while the financial incentive motivated them to increase and maintain their PA. A mixed-methods design was used. Participants were BC survivors and support individuals with a mean age of 58.5 years. At 6-month follow-up, participants completed a program evaluation questionnaire (n = 72) and participated in focus groups (n = 52) to explore their experience with Project MOVE. Despite the physical and psychological health benefits associated with physical activity (PA) for breast cancer (BC) survivors, up to 70% of female BC survivors are not meeting minimum recommended PA guidelines. The objective of this study was to evaluate acceptability and satisfaction with Project MOVE, an innovative approach to increase PA among BC survivors through the combination of microgrants and financial incentives. The findings provide support for the acceptability of Project MOVE as a strategy for increasing PA among BC survivors.

This study examined the interdependence and the mediating role of dysfunctional attitudes on the relationship between death anxiety and quality of life among patients with lung cancer and their caregivers. Death anxiety influences dysfunctional attitudes and quality of life of both patients and caregivers. Our results support the relevance of dysfunctional attitudes in understanding the impact of death anxiety and underscore the need for parallel psychosocial interventions. In patients, death anxiety was related to dependency (β = .51) and self-control (β = -.37); achievement (β = -.21) and self-control (β = .34) were related to quality of life. Among caregivers, death anxiety was related to all 3 dysfunctional attitudes of their own (βs = .23 to.32); dependency (β = -.22) was associated with quality of life. Caregiver quality of life was also associated with patient self-control (β = .22) and achievement (β = -.18). Patient self-control mediated the links between patient death anxiety with both patient and caregiver quality of life. The relationship between death anxiety and quality of life was mediated by dependency in caregivers. From March 2016 to April 2017, 173 pairs of patients and their caregivers enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of psychosocial support.

Fruit/vegetable intake (F/V), % calories from fat, and hypothesized psychosocial mediators were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Analysis of covariance assessed intervention effects on psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months. Mediation analysis using the bootstrap method evaluated the indirect intervention effects on dietary intake at 6 and 12 months through changes in psychosocial mediators at 6 and 12 months. Compared with controls, at 6 and 12 months, the intervention group reported greater improvements in stages of change (P < .001, P < .001, respectively), self-efficacy (P = .009, P = .002, respectively), snack preference for F/snack preference for F/V (P = .045, P = .002, respectively); at 12 months, the intervention group reported a decrease in chance-oriented external locus of control (P = .02). At 6 months, mediation analysis showed that the intervention effect was associated with an increase of 1.0 (95% CI, -0.1-2.4) serving/day of F/V, compared with the control group, although no indirect effect through the hypothesized psychosocial mediators was observed. At 12 months, the intervention was associated with an increase in 0.5 serving/day F/V through improved taste/snack preference for F/V at 6 and 12 months (95% CIs, 0.1-1.3, 0.0-1.4, respectively).

Differences between PROMIS and legacy measures of depression need to be considered when choosing instruments for use in trials of supportive care interventions and in clinical practice. Similar conclusions about intervention effects were found using PROMIS and legacy measures for pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, physical, and social functioning. Different conclusions were obtained for patient and caregiver depression: legacy measures indicated the efficacy of reflexology, while PROMIS depression measure did not. Accurate and efficient measurement of patient-reported outcomes is key in cancer symptom management trials. The newer Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and previously developed measures of similar conceptual content (legacy) are available to measure symptoms and functioning. This report compares the performance of two sets of measures, PROMIS and legacy, in a recently completed trial of a supportive care intervention that enrolled breast cancer patients and their friend or family caregivers.

Phytoestrogens were measured in plasma and prostate tissue by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA). Phytoestrogens have been suggested to reduce the risk of prostate cancer (CaP), but no data exists on how oral phytoestrogen supplementation influences phytoestrogen concentrations in prostate tissue. All patients had low baseline phytoestrogen concentrations and only 35% had a detectable plasma concentration of equol. Oral supplementation with phytoestrogens induced a statistically significant (P<0.001) 23- and 7-fold increase in prostate tissue concentrations of the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein, respectively. Supplemented patients demonstrated prostate tissue genistein and daidzein concentrations that were over twofold higher than their plasma. Interestingly, even though the placebo group did not receive phytoestrogen challenge, they also demonstrated twofold prostate tissue genistein and daidzein concentrations compared to their plasma values, suggesting that the prostate can concentrate available phytoestrogens. In addition, after the supplementation, 90% of the supplemented patients had a detectable plasma equol concentration. We conclude that prostate tissue can concentrate genistein and daidzein. Significant elevation of intraprostatic genistein and daidzein concentrations can be achieved with a short-term dietary phytoestrogen supplementation.

This literature review examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in four electronic databases until October 2015 to evaluate the effects of oral HM on NK cells in cancer patients. Data were pooled and computed in a meta-analysis. The methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Sixteen RCTs involving 1326 cancer patients were identified. Combination of HM and conventional treatment was associated with significantly higher level of NK cells compared with conventional cancer treatments (standardized mean difference, 1.218; 95% confidence interval 0.719-1.717; p < 0.001). Eight RCTs reported statistically significant improvements in the proportions or activity of NK cells in patient groups who received both HM and conventional treatment compared with patients who received conventional treatment alone, while eight RCTs reported no statistically significant differences between the two groups. Studies (n = 16) included in this review had insufficient quality of evidence with unclear (n = 1) and high (n = 15) values of the risk of bias. Although traditional oriental HM may have the positive effects on preserving the level of NK cells in cancer patients receiving conventional treatments, current evidence is inconclusive because of lack of high-quality evidence.

Increases from 1995 to 1997 were similar in magnitude to short-term increases between 1995 and 1996 that we have been previously reported. A randomized controlled trial based in 10 New Hampshire towns addressed children's use of protective clothing, shade, and sunscreen at freshwater beach areas. The intervention was provided initially between March and May 1996. A brief project follow-up contact was provided to schools, day care centers, beaches, and primary care offices between March and May 1997 to restock intervention materials and to answer questions. Observations of 1490 children during June through August of 1997 were compared with observations made prior to any intervention between June and August of 1995. In intervention towns, the proportion of children using at least some sun protection increased by 0.15 from 0.58 in 1995 to 0.73 in 1997 while the proportion in control towns increased by 0.03 (P = 0.033). This increase was due to more use of sunscreen, but not more use of protective clothing or shade. In 1997, care-givers of children in intervention towns reported receiving more sun protection information from school and health care sources than control town caregivers (62% versus 33%, P < 0.006). Reducing sun exposure during childhood may prevent skin cancer later in life. Sun protection increased immediately following implementation of the SunSafe multicomponent, community-based intervention delivered in 1996 through schools, day care centers, primary care offices, and beach recreation areas. Whether sun protection levels would remain higher than preintervention levels the following summer was unknown.

In high-participation areas, there was a significantly higher risk of lifestyle-(HR 1.37 [1.04, 1.79]) and cancer-related deaths (HR 1.47 [1.08, 2.02]) among women in the intervention group than control group. Regarding smoking-related cancer deaths, differences were even more pronounced. Among men, no significant difference in mortality was seen between control and intervention groups. All persons living in 73 areas of Copenhagen County, Denmark, were included in the Inter99 randomized trial in 1999 (intervention group n = 11,483; control group n = 47,122). All persons in the intervention group were invited for health checks and were offered lifestyle counseling if they were at high risk of ischemic heart disease. Areas were divided into low 35-49%, middle 50-54% and high ≥ 55% health check participation. All persons were followed in registers for 10-year cause-specific mortality.

The first 6 months resulted in a reduction in body weight and body fat among the intervention group subjects while the comparison group subjects remained stable. Subsequent measurements, at 12, 24 or 36, and 48 months, showed no significant differences in mean body weight, BMI, WHR, or body composition by study group. Also, no significant changes in these measures were demonstrated for either study group between baseline and 48 months. Excess adiposity has been shown to be associated with increased risk for breast cancer recurrence, and a plant-based eating pattern has been hypothesized to be protective. Whether a plant-based diet without specific energy goals will result in weight loss or changes in body composition in women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer has not been fully explored. This study was conducted to identify changes in body weight, anthropometric measures, and body composition over a four year period in a sub-sample of breast cancer survivors participating in a dietary intervention targeting increased intake of vegetables, fruit and fiber and decreased dietary fat intake. This randomized, controlled dietary intervention study compared longitudinal changes in intakes, body weight, waist:hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) and body composition by treatment group among fifty-two women previously treated for Stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer from the Arizona site of the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study. The dietary intervention aimed for eight servings of fruit and vegetables, 30 g fiber, < or = 20% total energy from fat per day, as well as daily intake of vegetable juice. The comparison group was advised to follow general dietary guidelines for cancer prevention. The dietary intervention efforts resulted in significant changes in diet toward an increase in plant foods and a decrease in dietary fat. Changes in weight, WHR, BMI, and body composition were not different over time or by study group assignment. Interventions that promote a plant-based diet without specific energy restriction do not appear to promote changes in body weight or body composition in women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. To adequately examine the role of energy restriction in reducing obesity-associated breast cancer recurrence, future interventions should include prescribed energy imbalance either through reduced intake and/or increased expenditure.

38,22457,Can complementary medicine increase adherence to chemotherapy dosing protocol? A controlled study in an integrative oncology setting.,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,28825195,"The impact of complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) on adherence to chemotherapy regimens is unclear. We explored the effect of patient-tailored CIM treatments on the relative dose intensity (RDI) of chemotherapy among patients with breast and gynecological cancer. A patient-tailored CIM program for patients with breast or gynecological cancer may be associated with a lower percentage of reduced RDI at 6 weeks, this in a sub-group of patients with higher adherence to CIM, and for specific chemotherapy agents, though this benefit did not persist after 12 weeks. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of CIM in cancer care. RDI was calculated for 106-treated patients (62 AIC) and 75 controls. Baseline-to-6-week RDI values were similar in both study arms, with a lower % RDI <1.0 among controls at 12 weeks (47 vs. 57.5%; P = 0.036). Adherence sub-groups had similar RDI values, though at 6 weeks, the AIC group had lower % RDI <1.0 (33.9 vs. 54.5%, P = 0.046). Total administered medication dose/planned dose was higher in the AIC group at 6 weeks for paclitaxel (82%/50%, P = 0.025) and carboplatin (87%/67%, P = 0.028), with no difference in cytoxan/adriamycin dosages. Chemotherapy-treated patients with breast or gynecological cancer were referred by their oncology healthcare professional to a CIM treatment program. Adherence to integrative care (AIC) was defined as ≥4 CIM treatments, with ≤30 days between each treatment.

Moderate strength training successfully prevented a strength loss in the IG that was remarkable in the CG (- 1.60 vs. 0.60, p = 0.029). Concerning the psychological parameters assessed via EORTC- and MFI-questionnaires, no significant improvements were found. As a result, we were able to show significant improvements in postural stability in monopedal stance [left leg 16.17 ± 3.67 vs. 21.55 ± 5.33 (p < 0.001) and right leg 15.14 ± 2.30 vs. 20.85 ± 5.05 (p < 0.001)] and in bipedal stance [T1 vs. T0, - 0.49 (IG) vs. + 1.14 (CG) p = 0.039]. The aim of this randomized-controlled trial (RCT) (n = 36) (IG: intervention group, n = 17) (CG: control group, n = 19) was to determine whether sensorimotor exercises have a positive effect on physical and psychological parameters in breast cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy (Paclitaxel). Breast cancer is the most common cancer disease of women in industrialized countries. Neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs are known to harm peripheral nerves and cause a chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN is one of the most common adverse events associated with Paclitaxel chemotherapy and may remain present long after the termination of chemotherapy. Thus, it reduces the patients' quality of life (QoL) both during chemotherapy and onwards, and can impose a danger on breast cancer survivors due to an increased risk of falling and fall-related injuries. Future studies should focus on the correlation of clinical and posturometry findings and subjective QOL such as the long-term-development of CIPN.

Stepped care comprised screening for distress, consultation between doctor and patient, and the provision of psychosocial services. Quality of care was measured with the Quality of Care from the Patient Perspective questionnaire. The analysis employed mixed-effects multivariate regression, adjusting for age and gender. Thirteen wards were randomized, and 1012 patients participated (n = 570 in stepped care and n = 442 in standard care). Patients who were highly distressed at baseline had 2.3 times the odds of saying they had had the possibility to converse in private with doctors and/or psychologists/social workers when they were in stepped care compared to standard care, 1.3 times the odds of reporting having experienced shared decision-making, 1.1 times the odds of experiencing their doctors as empathic and personal, and 0.6 times the odds of experiencing the care at the ward to be patient oriented. There was no evidence for an effect of stepped care on perceived quality of care in patients with moderate or low distress.

Eighteen Dutch hospitals were randomized to DA counseling (n = 235) or the control group with standard counseling (n = 101) in a pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial. The DA was provided to patients at, or soon after diagnosis. Decisional conflict, involvement, knowledge, and satisfaction with information were assessed with a questionnaire after treatment decision-making. Anxiety and depression served as covariates. The DA aimed to support shared decision-making, while outcomes for a majority of DA users were comparable to patients who received standard counseling. Patients, who are less comfortable with the online DA format or experience anxiety or depression symptoms, could require more guidance toward shared decision-making. To evaluate long-term DA effects, follow-up evaluation on treatment satisfaction and decisional regret will be done. The levels of decision involvement and conflict were comparable between patients in both groups. Patients with a DA felt more knowledgeable but scored equally well on a knowledge test as patients without a DA.

Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is a proven tool to improve physical performance in seniors and patients with chronic diseases. We therefore investigated the safety and feasibility of EMS in 45 patients undergoing autologous HSCT (n = 13), allogeneic HSCT (n = 11) and intensive chemotherapy (n = 21). Furthermore, physical (assessed by 6-min walking distance (6MWD) and short physical performance battery (SPPB)) and psychological performance (assessed by multidimensional fatigue inventory (MFI) and the EORTC QOL-C30 questionnaire) were measured before chemotherapy (T1) and at discharge from hospital (T2). Four patients died due to septic shock, two withdrew consent before the start of EMS training and five stopped EMS training during the study because of chemotherapy-related complications, loss of motivation or loss of ability to use EMS autonomously. Thirty-four out of 45 (76%) patients used EMS throughout the study period and participated in physical and psychological tests at time points 1 and 2. EMS-related adverse events were hematoma (n = 1) and muscle pain (n = 2). No bleeding events > 1 according to the WHO bleeding scale occurred. Decline in 6MWD from T1 to T2 was 24 m. The SPPB score stayed the same with 11 points at T1 and T2. Most MFI subscales showed stable fatigue levels and quality of life (QoL) did not decrease significantly throughout therapy.

Changes in self-report and objectively measured cognitive function were compared between the three groups from baseline (T1) to completion of the intervention (T2) and 4 weeks post intervention (T3). The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week Qigong intervention to improve objectively and subjectively assessed cognitive function in breast cancer survivors who were 2 months to 8 years post completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The study results suggest that mindfulness-based exercise may be superior to gentle exercise alone or survivorship support for improving self-report of cognitive function and distress after treatment for breast cancer. The mindfulness component may enhance the positive impact of exercise on cognitive function. Fifty participants consented (83% of desired sample) with an overall attrition rate of 28%. Attrition was highest for the gentle exercise group (50%). Group attendance adherence ranged from 44 to 67%. The a priori established rate of 75% weekly attendance was not achieved, nor was the goal of 75% adherence to home practice for the two exercise groups (7 to 41%). Self-report of cognitive function improved most for the Qigong group (p = .01). Improvement was demonstrated for the Trail Making A (gentle exercise, p = .007) and F-A-S verbal fluency (support group, p = .02) tests. Qigong participants reported the most reduction of distress (p = .02).

52,23853,Exercise improves functional capacity and lean body mass in patients with gastrointestinal cancer during chemotherapy: a single-blind RCT.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,30288602,"Participants (GIC, UICC III-IV; n = 44) were randomly assigned to home-based physical activity programme of 150 min moderate walking per week or a control group (CG). Functional status (SPPB: gait speed, balance, lower extremity muscle strength), postural sway, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, nutritional state (Mini Nutritional Assessment, MNA) and lean body mass were assessed according to established recommendations. All tests were performed before chemotherapy (T0), after two chemotherapy cycles (T1) and after 12 weeks (T2). Although growing evidence underlines the benefits of physical activity as supportive intervention for cancer patients, sparse data are available for exercise in patients with advanced disease stages, in particular for gastrointestinal cancer (GIC) patients who experience specific disease-associated limitations. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of home-based moderate intensity exercise on functional capacity, activities of daily living (ADL) and body composition in patients with advanced GIC during first-line chemotherapy. SPPB changes from T1 to T2 differed between groups with a comparably greater decrease in the CG (p < .05), but no changes or group differences over the whole study period (T0 to T2) were found. Exercise improved postural sway (T0 to T1; T0 toT2) and lean body mass (T1 to T2; T0 to T2) compared to the control group (p < .05). Gait speed, peripheral neuropathy and strength did not differ between groups (p > .05). Our results indicate that a home-based physical activity improves postural sway and body composition and might stabilize functional capacity in patients with advanced GIC during chemotherapy. Although the other outcomes did not differ between groups, aforementioned effects might contribute to a maintenance of independency in ADL and a better treatment tolerance and thus enhance patients' quality of life.

This contrasts with the significantly improved emotional functioning observed in FMW participants at 3 months and the short-term reductions in health service utilisation. Long-term increases in supportive care service utilisation suggest FMW only met needs while being actively used. While both groups reported reduced cancer-specific and general distress over time, between-group differences were not significant. Intervention participants reported lower total health service utilisation and supportive care utilisation post-intervention than controls (total HS use: between-group mean difference = - 1.07 (- 1.85 to - 0.28); supportive care use: between-group mean difference = - 0.64 (- 1.21 to - 0.06)) and significantly higher emotional functioning at 3 months (between-group mean difference = 7.04 (0.15 to 13.9)). At 6 months, the supportive care utilisation finding reversed (between-group mean difference = 0.78 points (0.19 to 1.37). Across remaining QoL and coping outcomes, no significant group differences emerged. This multicentre randomised controlled trial examined the efficacy of Finding My Way (FMW), a 6-week/6-module online self-guided psychotherapeutic intervention for newly diagnosed curatively treated cancer survivors, in reducing cancer-related distress and improving quality of life compared to an online attention control. Participants were randomised on a 1:1 ratio using a gender-stratified block design to intervention (n = 94) or attention control (n = 97), and were blinded to condition. Assessments were completed at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), 3 months (T2), and 6 months (T3) post-intervention.

Both interventions were administered over a period of 4 weeks. The outcomes studied were pain, shoulder range of motion (ROM), functionality, quality of life (QoL), and depression, immediately after treatment and 1 month later. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03182881. In conclusion, an MR-based treatment shows physical benefits (i.e., overall shoulder movement, functionality, and perceived pain) in women after breast cancer surgery. The scars derived from the treatment of breast cancer lead to adverse effects such as fibrosis or retractions of the connective tissue. Myofascial release (MR) seeks to reduce restrictions of the fascial system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the clinical impact of MR treatment on women survivors of breast cancer. After 4 weeks of treatment, only the participants who received MR experienced a significant decrease in pain intensity in the short and midterm (p < 0.05). This therapy also achieved a general improvement in ROM (p < 0.05), except for internal rotation, that persisted 1 month after treatment. Regarding functionality, both therapies achieved the level of significance (p < 0.05), but only MRG sustained the improvement in the midterm. General QoL, assessed with FACT-B, and its physical well-being dimension were significantly improved after MR implementation (p < 0.05), while the emotional dimension and the breast cancer subscale improved only with PMLD (p < 0.05).

The purpose of the present study was to determine the association of dyadic intervention for cancer patients and their family caregivers with quality of life (QOL), and other outcomes for people with cancer. In this review, dyadic interventions for caregivers and cancer patients were associated with improvements in multiple psychosocial aspects of patient outcomes. Twenty-three RCTs provided data on 2317 patient-caregiver dyads. In the meta-analysis, at the 0- to 3-month follow-up, dyadic intervention was associated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in patient total QOL (standardized mean difference [SMD], 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.50); the total spiritual aspect of QOL (SMD, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.06-0.50); the emotional (SMD, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.02-0.29), social (SMD, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.36), and mental (SMD, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07-0.46) aspects of QOL; depression (SMD, - 0.35; 95% CI, - 0.65 to - 0.05); anxiety (SMD, - 0.42; 95% CI, - 0.70 to - 0.13); relatedness (SMD, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04-0.32); and marital functioning (SMD, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.05-1.97). At the 3.1- to 6-month follow-up, dyadic intervention was associated with significant improvements in patient social aspect (SMD, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.35) and depression (SMD, - 0.29; 95% CI, - 0.56 to - 0.03). There was no association between dyadic interventions and the patient functional and physical aspects of QOL. Dyadic intervention was associated consistently with no improvements in hopelessness, pain, fatigue, and survival.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of telephone-based reminiscence therapy on the depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, and social support of colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression. Patients were divided randomly into a control group (CON, n = 45), telephone support group (TS, n = 45), and telephone-based reminiscence therapy group (TBR, n = 45). Patients in TS and TBR groups received six 20-40-min telephone intervention sessions conducted weekly. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6 weeks. The primary outcomes were changes on the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), which were used to evaluate depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes were changes in Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness (MUNSH), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) scores, which were used to evaluate anxiety symptoms, subjective well-being, and social support, respectively. These findings suggest that telephone-based reminiscence therapy can reduce depression symptoms in colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy. Telephone-based reminiscence therapy may also improve anxiety, but no better than telephone support. Alternatively, telephone-based reminiscence therapy did not improve subjective well-being or social support. We suggest that clinicians provide appropriate telephone-based reminiscence therapy in long-term care institutions based on patient mental health status. After 6 weeks, SDS and HAMD scores were significantly lower than pre-intervention baseline in the TBR group but not in the CON and TS groups (P < 0.05). Both SAS and HAMA scores were significantly reduced in TBR and TS groups but not the CON group (P < 0.05) following intervention; however, there was no significant difference in post-intervention scores between TS and TBR groups (P > 0.05). Neither telephone support nor telephone-based reminiscence therapy improved subjective well-being or social support (P > 0.05).

The 6-week online MBI comprised short videos, daily guided meditations and automated email reminders. Participants were asked to complete questionnaires at baseline and at 6-week post-randomisation. Study feasibility and acceptability were assessed through recruitment rates, retention and participant feedback. Clinical and psychosocial outcomes were compared between groups using linear mixed models. Sixty-nine (58%) eligible participants were randomised (46 in the intervention; 23 in the control group); mean age was 53.4 (SD 13.1); 54% were female. Study completion rate across both arms was 80%. The intervention was found helpful by 72% of the 32 respondents. The intervention significantly reduced the severity of FCR compared to the control group (mean difference = - 2.55; 95% CI - 4.43, - 0.67; p = 0.008). There was no difference between the intervention and control groups on any of the outcome measures. This online MBI was feasible and acceptable by people at high risk of melanoma recurrence. It significantly reduced FCR severity in this sample. Patients valued accessing the program at their own pace and convenience. This self-guided intervention has the potential to help survivors cope with emotional difficulties. An adequately powered randomised controlled trial to test study findings is warranted. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of an online mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for people diagnosed with melanoma. The potential benefit of the MBI on fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), worry, rumination, perceived stress and trait mindfulness was also explored.

Perceptions (n = 6) were categorized into three main themes including (i) Study Environment which consisted of three subthemes acrchversusfear of failure, power of results, and reminders of cancer and moving beyond. (ii) Influence of People encompassed two subthemes, i.e., personal relationships and self as a source of motivation; and (iii) Wearable Technology which was divided into two subthemes, i.e., objective insights into health and disconnect of person and technology. From the scaled responses, the most impactful barriers for participants within the intervention groups (n = 22) were ""feeling busy,"" ""lack of motivation,"" and ""weather."" Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six women who had participated in a 12-week, home-based physical activity intervention using Polar A360® activity trackers. Additionally, 22 participants from the physical activity interventions provided scaled responses to barriers of physical activity on weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used for qualitative data. Wearable technology was perceived largely as a facilitator to physical activity in the current study, but technologic difficulties created a barrier to physical activity adherence. Additionally, participants' perceptions of study design elements and social support influenced their acceptance and adherence to the home-based physical activity interventions and should be considered to inform the design and implementation of future studies.

NCT01582971. This project's purpose was to determine the effects of a home-based reflexology intervention on symptom-related use of health services and work-related productivity during the 11-week study. A total of 256 patients were randomized to four weekly reflexology sessions (each lasting 30 min, delivered by lay caregivers who received two training sessions by a professional reflexologist) or attention control. The Conventional Health Service and Productivity Costs Form was used to collect information on health service utilization and out-of-pocket expenditure of symptom management. The Health and Work Performance Questionnaire was used to measure workplace performance for patients during the study period. We used weighted and unweighted logistic and linear regression analyses.

Given the prohibition on hormone therapy in these women, the suppositories can be used as an alternative therapy to improve these symptoms. Vaginal atrophy is one of the most common side effects of using tamoxifen in women with breast cancer. Hormone therapy for vaginal atrophy is prohibited in these women. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of vitamin D and E vaginal suppositories on vaginal atrophy in women with breast cancer receiving tamoxifen. Women under breast cancer management receiving tamoxifen and showing symptoms of vaginal atrophy were randomized triple-blind to an 8-week trial on vaginal suppository vitamin E or vitamin D or placebo administered every night before bedtime. The genitourinary atrophy self-assessment tool was administered, and pH was measured in all three groups before the intervention and at the end of weeks 2, 4, and 8 of the intervention. The Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI) was also measured before the intervention and at the end of the eighth week. Data were analyzed with paired t tests, repeated measures analysis of variance, and chi-square test. Thirty-two patients were randomized in each group.

The entire SC program is more effective in women, patients in the first year after treatment, patients with a higher level of distress or anxiety or depressive disorder, patients who are feeling ill, and patients with less speech problems. Patients without a psychiatric disorder, with better psychological outcomes (HADS: all scales) and better health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (EORTC QLQ-C30/H&N35: global QOL, all functioning, and several symptom domains) were more likely to recover after watchful waiting. Patients with better scores on distress, emotional functioning, and dyspnea were more likely to recover after guided self-help. Sex, time since treatment, anxiety or depressive disorder diagnosis, symptoms of anxiety, symptoms of depression, speech problems, and feeling ill at baseline moderated the efficacy of SC compared to CAU. In this randomized controlled trial, head and neck and lung cancer patients with distress (n = 156) were randomized to SC or CAU. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate baseline factors associated with recovery after watchful waiting and guided self-help. Potential moderators of the effectiveness of SC compared to CAU were investigated using linear mixed models.

Research by our group has shown that acupressure bands are efficacious in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea (CIN) for breast cancer patients who expect nausea, and that their effectiveness in controlling CIN can largely be accounted for by patients' expectations of efficacy, i.e., a placebo effect. The present research examined if the effectiveness of acupressure bands could be enhanced by boosting patients' expectation of the bands' efficacy. Peak CIN for arms 1, 2, and 3 on a 1-7 scale was 3.52, 3.55, and 3.87, respectively (p = 0.46). Because no differences were observed between arms 1 and 2 (primary analysis), we combined these two arms (intervention) and compared them to controls for the following analyses. A significant interaction was found between intervention/control and receiving doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (yes/no) and pre-treatment anxiety (high/low). Intervention patients receiving doxorubicin had lower peak CIN than controls (3.62 vs. 4.38; p = 0.02).

The interaction between the group and 3-month leakage had a significant effect on anxiety; intervention subjects achieving a significant leakage reduction at 3 months exhibited significantly less anxiety at 6 months than other subjects (p = .04). Age, employment status, and receiving surgery at baseline were significantly associated with less anxiety, depression, and anger at 6 months. This study aimed to assess whether prostate cancer survivors who received a behavioral intervention to urinary incontinence had experienced a significant mood improvement. One hundred fifty-three prostate cancer survivors with persistent incontinence were included in this secondary data analysis. They were randomly assigned to usual care or interventions that provided pelvic floor muscle exercises and self-management skills. All subjects had measures of anxiety, depression, and anger at baseline, 3 months (post-intervention), and 6 months (follow-up). Negative binomial regression analysis was performed to examine the group status, daily leakage frequency at 3 months, and their interactions at 3 months as predictors for mood outcomes at 6 months, controlling for demographic and medical variables.

66,23920,Effects of exercise on inflammation in patients receiving chemotherapy: a nationwide NCORP randomized clinical trial.,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,30937600,"This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial studying 6 weeks of moderate-intensity walking and resistance exercise during chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. At pre- and post-intervention, patients provided blood to assess serum concentrations of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-γ, and receptor sTNFR1. We investigated relationships between cytokines using the correlations between changes in cytokine concentrations from pre- to post-intervention. A growing body of research suggests that inflammation plays a role in many chemotherapy-related toxicities such as fatigue, anxiety, and neuropathy. Regular exercise can change levels of individual cytokines (e.g., reducing IL-6, increasing IL-10); however, it is not known whether exercise during chemotherapy affects relationships between cytokines (i.e., whether cytokine concentrations change collectively vs. independently). This study assessed how 6 weeks of exercise during chemotherapy affected relationships between changes in concentrations of several cytokines. Our hypothesis-generating work suggests that regular exercise during 6 weeks of chemotherapy may cause certain cytokine concentrations to change collectively (not independently). This work enhances our understanding of relationships between cytokines and complements traditional analyses of cytokines in isolation. Future work should test for replication and relationships to patient outcomes. Clinical Trials.gov, # NCT00924651, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . We obtained complete data from 293 patients (149 randomized to exercise). Exercise strengthened the correlation between concentration changes of IL-10 and IL-6 (r = 0.44 in exercisers vs. 0.11 in controls; p = 0.001). We observed the same pattern for IL-10:IL-1β and IL-10:sTNFR1.

Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants randomised to the IG of a trial of home-based exercise, behaviour change and symptom management. Data were independently coded by two researchers, cross-checked and analysed using content analysis with a summary of arising themes. This home-based rehabilitation program was acceptable to most participants with multiple benefits reported including improved fitness, motivation and ability to manage symptoms. Exercise is important in lung cancer, yet most people do not meet the physical activity guidelines. The aim of this study was to characterise the views and experiences of participants with inoperable lung cancer who completed a home-based rehabilitation program. Of the IG (25/45), 55% were interviewed: mean (SD) age 67 (13) years; male 52%; disease stage n (%) III = 9 (36), IV = 11 (44); radical treatment intent n (%) 13 (52). The majority of participants reported program benefits, both in the physical domain (reduced sedentary time and improved strength, fitness and function) and the mental domain (motivation to keep healthy, preventing boredom). Support to self-manage symptoms was well received and many participants reported increased confidence in managing their symptoms. Exercise enablers included having expert health professional support; motivation to be stronger and better prepared for future challenges; and having an achievable and familiar program that was monitored. Treatment side-effects, pain from comorbidities and the weather were exercise barriers. For the majority of participants the use of a Fitbit™ activity tracker, text message exercise reminders and an exercise diary helped to promote adherence.

Eighty-four H&N patients were assigned to sedentary group or exercise group. The data were collected pretraining and posttraining, where the body composition, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), rate-pressure product (RPP), and exercise capacity were measured. Our data reported that body weight and body mass index were decreased after 8 weeks of chemotherapy in the sedentary group but not in the exercise group. The decreased visceral fat and the increased skeletal muscle rate had been found in the exercise group after 8 weeks of training. In addition, in the exercise group, the HR, HR recovery, BP, BP recovery, RPP, and minutes walking distance were better than the sedentary group. Results from this study suggested exercise training significantly improved exercise responses and body composition. These findings suggested that exercise can help to promote cardiopulmonary fitness and exercise capacity for H&N cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Studies have found that many chemotherapy drugs will produce multiple side effects and complications in cancer patients, especially in the case of the cardiovascular disease. This study was intended to investigate whether the exercise training intervention could improve the body composition and exercise responses of patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.

Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the SMI group had a medium effect in change of symptom clusters compared to the control group at T2. Moreover, after adjusting for baseline between normal and higher levels of sympathetic tone activity, significant differences existed in fatigue and depression at T2 and sleep disturbance at T3. A parallel and randomized, controlled study with repeated measures design was used. A total of 100 women with breast cancer were randomly assigned to the SMI or a control group. The outcome measurements of symptom cluster were collected using the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the neurological reactivity with heart rate variability at four time points: before commencement of the intervention (T0), immediately afterward (T1), 1 week later (T2), and 3 weeks after the intervention (T3). This study aimed to explore the possible range of change of a single-session music intervention (SMI) on symptom clusters and neurological reactivity for women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. A single-session music intervention can be effectively used to reduce symptom clusters for women with breast cancer.

However, the effectiveness of exercise programs to improve QOL in real-world settings is unknown, as are factors related to external validity. This hinders dissemination and scalability. This scoping review synthesized published research on community-based exercise programs for cancer survivors and reported on the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM). A systematic literature search identified community-based exercise programs for adult cancer survivors (1980-March 2018), that met the following inclusion criteria: at least one face-to-face exercise session, the primary aim of program evaluation (i.e., feasibility/effectiveness), and pre/post measure of QOL. Data were coded using the RE-AIM framework. The effect size was calculated for overall QOL. Community-based exercise programs are effective for improving QOL in adult cancer survivors. Recommendations are provided to improve reporting across RE-AIM dimensions, which is an important step to enhance the scalability of programs and thus, the potential for exercise to be fully integrated into system-level standard care for cancer survivors. Community-based exercise programs are a resource to improve QOL for adult cancer survivors. Electronic database search yielded 553 articles; 31 studies describing unique programs were included for review. All studies described at least one element of implementation and most (80.6%) reported a significant (p < .05) improvement in at least one subscale, or total QOL. Few studies reported on indicators of reach (16.1%), adoption (6.5%), individual (16.1%), or system-level maintenance (32.3%).

The samples were selected by convenience sampling method and were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, the patients implemented relaxation techniques once a day for 30 min during 60 consecutive days in addition to receiving routine care, while patients in the control group received only routine care. Before and after the intervention, the Persian version of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (CSEI) was completed. The relaxation seems to be potentially effective in promoting self-esteem of patients with cancer. Further studies, particularly randomized clinical trials with higher sample size and more power, are needed to confirm the obtained findings. Cancer is usually associated with decreased self-esteem. Relaxation is one of the most effective methods to promote self-esteem of patients with chronic diseases. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of relaxation on self-esteem of patients with cancer. After the interventions, significant differences were observed between groups in favor of the relaxation group in total score of CSEI and all its subscales (P = 0.0001). In the experimental group, a significant increase in total score and all subscales of CSEI was observed after the intervention (P = 0.001), whereas in the control group, a significant decrease was found in all dimensions (P = 0.001).

Patients performed stretching exercises for 3 months. During the three study visits, maximal mouth opening was measured and the patients completed questionnaires on mandibular function and quality of life. In our study population (n = 27), five patients did not start the exercise protocol, eight patients discontinued exercises, and two patients were lost to follow-up. No significant differences regarding the change in mouth opening between the two devices were found. Patients had an increase in MMO of 3.0 mm (IQR - 2.0; 4.0) using the TheraBite® Jaw Motion Rehabilitation System™ and 1.5 mm (IQR 1.0; 3.0) using the Dynasplint Trismus System®. Exercising with either stretching device was challenging for the patients due to the intensive exercise protocol, pain during the exercises, fitting problems with the stretching device, and overall deterioration of their medical condition. The effects of the two stretching devices did not differ significantly in our study population. The factors described, influencing the progression of stretching exercises, need to be taken into account when prescribing a similar stretching regimen for trismus in head and neck cancer patients.

Patients were randomly assigned to the early oral feeding group (intervention group) or the conventional postoperative management group (control group) for each procedure. We evaluated the length of postoperative hospital stay and the incidence of postoperative complications in each group. Early oral feeding did not shorten the postoperative hospital stay after DG. The higher incidence of postoperative complications precluded the unselected adoption of early oral feeding for DG patients. Further confirmative studies are required to definitively establish the potential benefits of early oral feeding for TG patients. No significant differences in length of postoperative stay were found between the intervention and control groups of the patients who underwent DG. The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly greater in the DG intervention group. In contrast, the length of postoperative stay was significantly shorter in the TG intervention group, although the TG group did not attain the established target sample size.

Treatment of lymphedema is based on intensive decongestive physiotherapy followed by a long-term maintenance treatment. We analyzed the factors influencing lymphedema volume during maintenance treatment. Prospective cohort of 537 patients with secondary arm lymphedema were recruited in a single lymphology unit and followed for 12 months. Lymphedema volume was recorded prior to and at the end of intensive treatment, and at month 6 and month 12 follow-up visits. Multivariate models were fitted to analyze the respective role of the three components of complete decongestive therapy, i.e. manual lymph drainage, low stretch bandage, and elastic sleeve, on lymphedema volume during the 1-year maintenance phase therapy. Mean volume of lymphedema was 1,054 +/- 633 ml prior and 647 +/- 351 ml after intensive decongestive physiotherapy. During the 1-year maintenance phase therapy, the mean lymphedema volume slightly increased (84 ml-95% confidence interval [CI]: 56-113). Fifty-two percent of patients had their lymphedema volume increased above 10% from their value at the end of the intensive decongestive physiotherapy treatment phase. Non-compliance to low stretch bandage and elastic sleeve were risk factors for an increased lymphedema after 1-year of maintenance treatment (RR: 1.55 [95% CI: 1.3-1.76]; P < 0.0001 and RR: 1.61 (95% CI: 1.25-1.82); P = 0.002, respectively).

77,25461,A cognitive behavioral therapy intervention to promote weight loss improves body composition and blood lipid profiles among overweight breast cancer survivors.,Breast cancer research and treatment,17058023,"Seventy six women (89.4%) completed the intervention. Independent t-test to evaluate group differences at 16 weeks showed significant differences in weight, body mass index, percent fat, trunk fat, leg fat, as well as waist and hip circumference between intervention and control groups (P <or= 0.05). Furthermore, levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were also significantly reduced following the intervention. These results indicate that 16 weeks of a CBT program for weight management may reduce obesity and CVD risk in overweight breast cancer survivors. Overweight or obesity is an established negative prognostic factor in breast cancer. Co-morbidities associated with obesity, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), may negatively impact quality of life and survival in this population. Our purpose was to determine the effect of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for weight loss through exercise and diet modification on risk factors for recurrence of breast cancer, and risks for CVD associated with obesity. Eighty-five overweight or obese breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to a once weekly, 16-week intervention or wait-list control group. The intervention incorporated elements of CBT for obesity, addressing a reduction in energy intake, as well exercise, with a goal of an average of 1 h a day of moderate to vigorous activity.

Women with early-stage breast cancer were randomized within 6 weeks of completing adjuvant therapy to a survivorship intervention group (SI) or control group (CG). All subjects were given the NCI publication, ""Facing Forward: Life after Cancer Treatment."" The SI also met with a nurse/nutritionist to receive a treatment summary, surveillance, and lifestyle recommendations. Both groups completed questionnaires on the impact of cancer (IOC), patient satisfaction (FACIT-TS-PS), and assessment of survivor concerns (ASC) at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Within and between group t tests and linear regression analyses were performed. Among 126 women (60 CG, 66 SI), mean age was 54 years, 48 % were Hispanic, and the groups were well-balanced by baseline characteristics. No significant differences between the CG and SI on the FACIT-TS-PS or IOC at 3 and 6 months were seen. The ASC health worry subscale was lower (less worry) in the SI compared to CG (p = 0.02). At all time-points, Hispanic women had higher (worse) health worry (p = 0.0008), social-life interference (p = 0.009), and meaning of cancer scales (p = 0.0004), and more trust in medical professionals (p = 0.03) compared to non-Hispanic women. While the SI did not lead to significant improvements in most patient-reported outcomes, it was associated with decreased health worry.

A randomized pragmatic trial with two parallel arms was performed. Women with confirmed diagnoses of breast cancer were randomized (stratified by usual care treatment) to receive individualized complementary medicine (CM group) or usual care alone (usual care group). Both groups were allowed to use conventional treatment for breast cancer. Primary endpoint was the breast cancer-related quality of life FACT-B score at 6 months. For statistical analysis, we used analysis of covariance (with factors treatment, stratum, and baseline FACT-B score) and imputed missing FACT-B scores at 6 months with regression-based multiple imputation. A total of 275 patients were randomized between April 2011 and March 2012 to the CM group (n = 136, 56.3 ± 10.9 years of age) or the usual care group (n = 139, 56.0 ± 11.0). After 6 months from randomization, adjusted means for health-related quality of life were higher in the CM group (FACT-B score 107.9; 95 % CI 104.1-111.7) compared to the usual care group (102.2; 98.5-105.9) with an adjusted FACT-B score difference between groups of 5.7 (2.6-8.7, p < 0.001). Thus, an additional individualized and complex complementary medicine intervention improved quality of life of breast cancer patients compared to usual care alone.

Through Jan 31, 2017, five hundred and forty-two (66.2%) of them consented to analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Eleven pathogenic mutations were found (BRCA1, n = 2; BRCA2, n = 9), corresponding to a mutation prevalence of 2.0%. Six out of 11 fulfilled the Swedish BRCA testing criteria, and 9 out of 11 fulfilled the NCCN testing criteria. None of the BRCA-associated tumors were of the luminal A-like subtype. Very few patients contacted us for telephone genetic counseling or practical questions, suggesting that a majority felt that the written pre-test information was sufficient for them to make a decision on testing.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate satisfaction with the BRCAsearch testing procedure and, furthermore, to report on uptake rates of prophylactic surgeries among mutation carriers. A great majority (96.0%) of the responders were content with the method used for providing information within the study, and 98.7% were content with having pursued genetic testing. 11.1% answered that they would have liked to receive more oral information. In an adjusted logistic regression model, patients with somatic comorbidity (OR 2.56; P = 0.02) and patients born outside of Sweden (OR 3.54; P = 0.01) were more likely, and patients with occupations requiring at least 3 years of university or college education (OR 0.37; P = 0.06) were less likely to wanting to receive more oral information. All 11 mutation carriers attended post-test genetic counseling. At a median follow-up of 2 years, the uptake of prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy was 100%, and the uptake of prophylactic mastectomy was 55%. Satisfaction with a simplified BRCA1/2 testing procedure was very high.

Forty-one women were included. The proportion of stable or improved women was significantly different between EXP and CTRL groups at 6 months after enrolment for both arm pain (p = 0.01) and asymmetry (p < 0.01). Noteworthy, only one EXP woman had worsened after 6 months. NPRS significantly decreased in the EXP group only, with a median variation of 2 points. Arm ELV significantly decreased with respect to the baseline value in the EXP group only, with a median reduction of 8%. Consecutive patients treated with CDT over a 1-year period at an Italian facility were randomly assigned to either experimental (EXP, saCDT course) or control (CTRL, usual care) group. Women were assessed before, at 1, and 6 months from enrolment. Pain assessed by the numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) was the primary outcome. Arm asymmetry assessed by the excess limb volume (ELV) was the secondary outcome. Outcome variations were compared to their MCID to classify women as improved, stable, or worsened. After surgery, breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a frequent chronic condition. The complex decongestive therapy (CDT) delivered by physiotherapists at hospitals is the state-of-the-art treatment choice.

After providing informed consent, the participants were randomly assigned either to the intervention group or to the waitlist control group. The intervention consisted of six weekly psychosexual counseling sessions that lasted from 90 to 120 min. Data were collected by the demographic and clinical forms, Beck Depression Inventory, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Larson Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire and sexual quality of life-female (SQOL-F) questionnaire. Mean age of patients in control and intervention groups were 43.8 ± 6.6 and 44.84 ± 6.7, respectively. More than 65% of the patients in the both groups were either normal or showed a low level of depression.

These findings are consistent with the lack of benefit observed in prospective prevention trials. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov NCT01948128. Epidemiologic and preclinical data suggest a potential role for vitamin D in breast cancer treatment and prevention. However, results of prospective randomized trials are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on breast tumour proliferation and apoptosis. We conducted a prospective, randomized, phase 2, double-blinded pre-surgical window of opportunity trial. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were randomized to receive 40,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day or placebo for 2 to 6 weeks prior to breast surgery. The primary outcome was the relative change in proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3 apoptotic assay [CC3]) in primary breast cancer cells pre and post treatment. Of 83 patients randomized, 80 completed the study (43 (53.8%) vitamin D and 37 (46.3%) placebo). Mean duration of drug intake was 19 days (range 9-28 days).

Sexual dysfunction, fueled by body image stress, is prevalent in women with a history of breast or gynecologic cancer. Preliminary data support that mind-body connections may improve sexual health outcomes through improving body image. Consented participants were randomized 2:1 to hypnosis or PMR. Both arms consisted of three face-to-face sessions delivered by a trained therapist. Sessions were every 2 weeks for 6 weeks; participants practiced at home between sessions using an audio recording. Eighty-seven women were randomized, 59 to hypnosis and 28 to PMR. Both groups reported significant improvements on body image over time (within group effect size Cohen's d = 0.49-0.75) with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.15). Secondary outcomes were not significantly different between groups. The hypnosis group improved more in sexual satisfaction and sexual interest while the PMR group improved more in positive affect.

We randomized women aged 30-65 who had not completed Pap smear screening in the past 3 years into two groups: (1) HPV self-sampling delivered in-person (IP) by a community health worker (CHW; IP + SS) or (2) HPV self-sampling delivered via US mail (SS + Mail). Our primary outcome was HPV self-sampling completion by 6-month post-study enrollment. HPV self-sampling has previously been shown to increase cervical cancer screening among ethnic minority and immigrant women. We conducted a randomized pragmatic trial to examine the effectiveness of HPV self-sampling delivered via in-person versus by US mail for medically underserved Hispanic, Haitian, and non-Hispanic Black women living in South Florida. We enrolled 600 women. Approximately 65% were Hispanic and 35% were Haitian or non-Hispanic Black. Nearly half (43%) had an income of less than $20,000/year and 67% were uninsured.

A web-based intervention can reduce risk of melanoma through changes in relevant behaviors among first-degree relatives of melanoma survivors. Future research should identify methods for making this type of intervention accessible to more families and for broadening the reach to other types of cancer families. First degree relatives in the intervention arm significantly increased their yearly performance of both skin self examination and thorough provider examination from baseline to 12-month follow-up while the control FDRs decreased their yearly performance of both of those behaviors (p's = 0.006 and 0.005, respectively). Several sun protection behaviors increased significantly in FDRs in the intervention arm but not the control arm, including wearing a covering on the head (p = 0.005), staying in available shade (p = 0.008), and avoiding sun exposure during peak hours (p = 0.010). Some of these changes were mediated by perceptions of risk and other process variables. A total of 313 families that included one first-degree relative were recruited to join this randomized trial. All intervention families received access to the Suntalk website developed to promote family communication and behavioral risk reduction among families of melanoma survivors. Melanoma can be prevented through reducing sun exposure and detected early by increasing examination of skin for lesions. First-degree relatives of melanoma cases have higher risk than the general population and, therefore, could be targets of behavioral interventions through families. We tested the effects of a family-based web delivered intervention to melanoma families on the melanoma risk reduction behaviors of first-degree relatives of melanoma cases.

Rural cancer survivors (RCS) have poorer health outcomes and face multiple challenges-older age, and limited transportation, education, income, and healthcare access. Yet, RCS are understudied. The Reach-out to ENhancE Wellness(RENEW) trial, a home-based, diet and exercise intervention among 641 breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors addressed many of these challenges. Rural versus urban survivors report significantly more favorable mean (SE) changes in physical functioning [- 0.66 (1.47) v - 1.71 (1.00)], physical health [+ 0.14 (0.71) v - 0.74 (0.50)], and fewer adverse events [1.58 (0.08) v 1.64 (0.06)]. Rural versus urban survivors reported smaller increases in F&Vs [+ 1.47 (0.23) v + 1.56(0.16); p = 0.018], and lower percentages achieved goal behavior for endurance exercise and intakes of F&Vs and saturated fat. The RENEW intervention reduced declines in physical health and functioning among RCS to a significantly greater extent than for urban cancer survivors. All survivors significantly improved intakes of F&V and saturated fat, and endurance exercise; however, lower percentages of rural versus urban survivors met goal suggesting that more intensive interventions may be needed for RCS.

As these individuals are insufficiently recognized, we evaluated an online family history tool, consisting of a patient-administered family history questionnaire and an automated genetic referral recommendation, to facilitate the identification of patients with hereditary CRC or FCC. Between 2015 and 2016, all newly diagnosed CRC patients in five Dutch outpatient clinics, were included in a trial with a stepped-wedge design, when first visiting the clinic. Each hospital continued standard procedures for identifying patients at risk (control strategy) and then, after a predetermined period, switched to offering the family history tool to included patients (intervention strategy). After considering the tool-based recommendation, the health care provider could decide on and arrange the referral. Primary outcome was the relative number of CRC patients who received screening or surveillance recommendations for themselves or relatives because of hereditary CRC or FCC, provided by genetic counseling. The intervention effect was evaluated using a logit-linear model. With the tool, 46/489 (9.4%) patients received a screening or surveillance recommendation, compared to 35/292 (12.0%) in the control group. In the intention-to-treat-analysis, accounting for time trends and hospital effects, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.58). A family history tool does not necessarily assist in increasing the number of CRC patients and relatives enrolled in screening or surveillance recommendations for hereditary CRC or FCC.

Despite the high incidence of neurological and functional deficits in patients affected by brain tumours (BTs), rehabilitation treatment of this population is not as well established as it is for patients with other neurological conditions. To assess functional outcome in brain tumour inpatients who underwent early rehabilitation after surgery. 75 patients who had undergone neurosurgery for primary BTs and 75 patients affected by stroke were enrolled in a case-control study. All patients were evaluated by means of a core set of clinical scales (Functional Independence Measure, Sitting Balance score, Standing Balance score, Hauser Index, Massachusetts General Hospital Functional Ambulation Classification). Patients were evaluated before the beginning (T0) and at the end (T1) of rehabilitation treatment. The neurorehabilitation programme consisted of individual 60-min sessions of treatment, administered once a day, six days a week, for four consecutive weeks. Speech therapy was included when aphasia was diagnosed. All the measures of outcome were indicative of substantial improvements for neuro-oncological and for stroke patients (P = 0.000). Analysis of subgroups showed that patients affected by meningioma achieved better results (in efficiency terms) as regards independence in activities of daily living (P = 0.02) and mobility (P = 0.04) compared with patients affected by glioblastoma or stroke.

Clinical implementation of this adaptable program merits consideration for clinically stable patients with cognitive dysfunction. Further development and larger prospective cognitive rehabilitation trials appear warranted. Adherence (% sessions completed) was high for both GMT (98.9%) and BHP (84.4%). Executive functions improved with GMT but not BHP or WAIT (repeated measures analysis of variance, time-by-group interaction, post-training P = 0.077, follow-up P = 0.046). Both intervention groups reported fewer cognitive concerns at post-training (P = 0.049) and follow-up (P < 0.001). Functional goal attainment was greatest with GMT (post-training P = 0.027, follow-up P = 0.064). Patients with brain tumors face unique quality of life challenges. Executive dysfunction is common and functionally limiting, with no established treatments as standard care. This pilot study evaluated the efficacy of Goal Management Training (GMT), a behavioral intervention combining mindfulness and strategy training, for improving executive and real-life functioning in this population. Twenty-five primary brain tumor survivors were randomized to GMT, an active control (Brain Health Program, BHP), or a wait-list (WAIT) control group. The BHP was a supportive care intervention offering education and activities to promote general brain health, without cognitive strategy training. Participants in GMT and BHP completed eight individual sessions and homework between sessions; those in WAIT received usual care. Assessments at baseline, immediately post-training, and 4-month follow-up used a battery of objective and subjective measures, including functional goal attainment.

We conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating whether family-involved interventions improve patient outcomes among adults with cancer. RCTs enrolling patients with cancer were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycInfo and other sources through December 2012. Studies were limited to subjects over 18 years of age, published in English language, and conducted in the United States. Patient outcomes included global quality of life; physical, general psychological and social functioning; depression/anxiety; symptom control and management; health care utilization; and relationship adjustment. We identified 27 unique trials, of which 18 compared a family intervention to usual care or wait list (i.e., usual care with promise of intervention at completion of study period) and 13 compared one family intervention to another individual or family intervention (active control). Compared to usual care, overall strength of evidence for family interventions was low. The available data indicated that overall, family-involved interventions did not consistently improve outcomes of interest. Similarly, with low or insufficient evidence, family-involved interventions were not superior to active controls at improving cancer patient outcomes. Overall, there was low or insufficient evidence that family and caregiver interventions were superior to usual or active care. Variability in study populations and interventions made pooling of data problematic and generalizing findings from any single study difficult.

Outcome measures were primarily evaluated using self-report questionnaires. The study protocol is feasible for a large-scale study. The educational material intervention is broadly accepted by the study participants with a promising positive effect on BMD testing rates. The participation rate, defined as the proportion of eligible participants who consented to participate, was 39.1%. Primary outcome measure was obtained for 98% of the recruited women. During the 6-month follow-up period, BMD testing rates were significantly higher in the groups receiving educational materials by mail (26%, 95%CI = 10 to 49) and by patient choice (18%, 95%CI = 5 to 41), when compared with the control group (6%, 95%CI = 0.3 to 25).

No adverse events were reported. Musculoskeletal side effects are common among breast cancer survivors on adjuvant AI therapy, therefore, effective treatments are needed for symptom relief and to improve adherence to these life-saving medications. In this pilot study, acupuncture reduced AI-related joint symptoms and improved functional ability and was well-tolerated. Postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who had self-reported musculoskeletal pain related to adjuvant AI therapy were randomized in a crossover study to receive acupuncture twice weekly for 6 weeks followed by observation or vice-versa. The intervention included full body and auricular acupuncture, and a joint-specific point prescription. Outcome measures included the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) quality of life measure, and serum levels of inflammatory markers, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have become the standard of care for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal, hormone-sensitive breast cancer. However, patients receiving AIs may experience joint symptoms, which may lead to early discontinuation of this effective therapy.

The groups did not differ significantly on the proportion who had obtained or made an appointment for a pap test at follow-up (51 vs. 48 %, p = 0.35). Both groups reported high levels of self-efficacy regarding pap screening at post-intervention. A one-time interactive, multimedia educational intervention improved cervical cancer knowledge and attitudes among low-income Latinas but had no effect on cervical cancer-screening behavior. Exposure of the control group to the pre-test conducted on the multimedia kiosk may have influenced their screening behavior.

105,32079,Cost-Consequence Analysis Alongside a Randomised Controlled Trial of Hospital Versus Telephone Follow-Up after Treatment for Endometrial Cancer.,Applied health economics and health policy,29651778,"Regular outpatient follow-up programmes are usually offered to patients following treatment for gynaecological and other cancers. Despite the substantial resources involved in providing these programmes, there is evidence that routine follow-up programmes do not affect survival or the likelihood of detecting recurrence and may not meet patient needs. Alternative follow-up modalities may offer the same outcomes at lower cost. We examined the costs of using telephone-based routine follow-up of women treated for endometrial cancer undertaken by specialist gynaecology oncology nurses in comparison to routine hospital-based follow-up. ISRCTN: 75220876, prospectively registered 28 October 2011. Telephone follow-up was estimated to be cost-neutral for the NHS and may free up clinic time for other patients. There was some evidence that telephone follow-up may be more efficient for patients and wider society, and is not associated with additional psychological morbidity, lower patient satisfaction or reduced quality of life. Psychological morbidity, psychosocial needs, patient satisfaction and quality of life did not differ between arms. Patients randomised to telephone follow-up underwent more and longer consultations. There was no difference in total health service mean per patient costs at 6 months (mean difference £8, 95% percentile confidence interval: - £147 to £141) or 12 months (mean difference: - £77, 95% percentile confidence interval: - £334 to £154). Estimated return journey costs per patient for hospital consultations were £11.47. Productivity costs were approximately twice as high under hospital follow-up. The ENDCAT trial randomised 259 women at five centres in the north west of England with a known diagnosis of Stage I endometrial cancer who had completed primary treatment on a 1:1 basis to receive either standard hospital outpatient follow-up or a telephone follow-up intervention administered by specialist nurses. A cost-consequence analysis was undertaken in which we compared costs to the health system and to individuals with the trial's co-primary outcomes of psychological morbidity and participant satisfaction with information received.

Fourteen participants (68.8 ± 3.4 years) completed 12 weeks of a mixed exercise program (MEXP) (n = 6) or stretching (n = 8) while they were under cancer treatment. Five tests of the Senior Fitness Test (Chair Stand, 8-Foot Up & Go, Arm Curl, Sit & Reach, 6 min Walk Test), two maximal strength tests (leg press and handgrip) and a Global Physical Capacity Score (GPCS) were used to assess physical capacity. For the amount of SBT (min/day), we used question 1 of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly. A 12-week mixed exercise program led to significant improvements in physical capacity and may reduce SBT.

Aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) are prevalent among patients on AI therapy, which leads to a lower quality of life and poor adherence to AI treatment. We evaluated whether Yi Shen Jian Gu granules (YSJG) is effective and safe to relieve AIMSS in patients with breast cancer. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to the YSJG group or the placebo group. Both groups had a 12-week treatment period and a 12-week follow-up period. Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index, and the Modified Score for the Assessment and Quantification of Chronic Rheumatoid Affections of the Hands (M-SACRAH) were obtained at baseline and at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. Of 146 participants enrolled, 84 were randomly assigned, and 77 were evaluable at 12 weeks. Baseline characteristics were comparable between two groups. The primary outcome was the differences in mean BPI-SF scores at 12 weeks. The worst pain scores decreased by 3.10 points (50.2%; 95% CI, 2.50 to 3.65) for YSJG group compared with a 1.63-point decrease (26.9%; 95% CI, 3.86 to 4.97) for the placebo group (P = 0.001). Significantly improvements were also observed for the WOMAC and M-SACRAH. Possibly YSJG-related side effects were grade 1 nausea (10%) and grade 2 diarrhea (2%). Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and serum estradiol were kept in the postmenopausal range before and after YSJG treatment. Patients with AIMSS treated with YSJG granules had significant improvements in musculoskeletal symptoms. YSJG is effective, safe and well-tolerated in managing AIMSS.

This randomized prospective single center study allocated patients to the initiation of a standard analgesic treatment exclusively (arm A) or associated to osteopathy (arm B) between from 1 to 12months after surgery. Osteopathy improves the control of pain and the quality of life of patients. Twenty-five to 65% of patients suffer from chronic pain after breast cancer. The treatment combines analgesic drugs and psychophysical techniques. Twenty-eight patients (A: 14; B: 14, median age 50 years) were included from April 2011 to February 2014; the study was stopped due to a too slow recruitment. No difference in the VAS pain score between arms was observed at j90 (P=0.258), nor at 6 and 12 months. At j90, the HADS depression score was reduced in arm B (P=0.049).

112,36196,Assessing Changes in the Activity Levels of Breast Cancer Patients During Radiation Therapy.,Clinical breast cancer,28916400,"After institutional review board approval, activity levels were quantified before, during, and after RT with measurements of steps, miles walked, calories burned, and sleep metrics in 10 women fitted with activity trackers. All data were uploaded and tabulated on a secure database. Multivariable linear regressions were used to evaluate changes in these variables over time during the RT course. Radiation therapy (RT) is often delivered after lumpectomy for women with breast cancer. A common perceived side effect of RT is fatigue, yet its exact effect on activity levels and sleep is unknown. In this study we analyzed the change in activity levels and sleep using an activity tracking device before, during, and after RT for women with early stage breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ who underwent adjuvant RT. Median step count was 5047 per day (range, 2741-15,508) and distance traveled was 1.6 miles per day (range, 0.9-5.3). Step count, distance, and calories decreased by an average of 54 steps per day, 0.02 miles per day, and 3 calories per day (median calories 1822; range, 1461-2712) during RT, respectively. These changes were statistically significant (P < .001), but not clinically relevant. There was no significant change in sleep (average 6.8 hours per night; range, 5.5-8.3). RT has a minimal effect on activity or sleep in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer. Activity levels varied greatly between patients in a population of women undergoing hypofractionated RT. Because increased activity levels correlate with improved outcomes, further studies evaluating attempts to increase physical activity during as well as after treatment with radiation are warranted.

Within an 893-participant nested case-control AIA genome-wide association study, we nested a 72 AIA case-144 control assessment of vitamin D plasma concentrations, corrected for seasonal and geographic variation. We also examined 9 baseline inflammatory cytokines: interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon (IFN)γ, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17, IL-23, and chemokine ligand (CCL)-20. Finally, we analyzed the multivariate effects of baseline factors: vitamin D level, previously identified musculoskeletal single nucleotide polymorphisms, age, body mass index, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) Fok-I variant genotype on AIA development. Changes in vitamin D from baseline to 6 months were not significantly different between cases and controls. Elevated inflammatory cytokine levels were not associated with development of AIA. The multivariate model included no clinical factors associated with AIA. However, women with the VDR Fok-I variant genotype were more likely to have a lower IL-1β level (P = .0091) and less likely to develop AIA after 6 months of AI compared with those with the wild type VDR (P < .0001). In this nested case-control correlative study, vitamin D levels were not significantly associated with development of AIA; however, patients with the Fok-I VDR variant genotype were more likely to have a significant reduction in IL-1β level, and less likely to develop AIA.

Based upon these results (which suggest that SJW may be effective in maintaining smoking cessation) and the high compliance and few AEs, we conclude that SJW demonstrates feasibility for use in smoking cessation. If SJW proves to be effective in larger controlled studies, it could represent a less expensive, more readily accessible and well-tolerated agent to promote tobacco cessation. Subjects completed validated surveys and a focused physical examination at baseline.

For a period of 12 weeks, participants were randomly assigned into WE and control groups. The patients and family members in the WE group were provided with WE information about treatment, diet, social needs, rehabilitation, physical/mental health education, communication strategies, and patient care advice at least 3 times per week during treatment. Qualitative feedback of the participants was recorded during the intervention. Food Composition Database, the Family Environment Scale, patients/caregivers quality-of-life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung/Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer Scale), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were measured at baseline and for 12 weeks. Data were analyzed to compare the different outcomes. Findings from this study suggest that WE interventions in patients' family with stage IV NSCLC undergoing icotinib hydrochloride treatment are significant improvements in both HADS and quality of life. These data also indicate that lung cancer disparities are unlikely to be associated with differential willingness to receive care but that Chinese may perceive financial and insurance ebarriers to treatment. WE interventions in patients with stage IV NSCLC undergoing icotinib hydrochloride treatment and their family resulted in strong intentions to engage in health-promoting behaviors related to physical activity, smoking cessationaaa, and nutrition at the treatment period. WE intervention is a viable way to improve quality of life and HADS. Of the 126 caregivers (64 WE and 62 control), 120 completed the study.

Issues such as sustainability of such programmes and advocacy relating to caregiver burden need further research. Breast cancer is the leading form of cancer among women in Nigeria. The care of such patients has shifted from hospital-based care to home and community care, with the resultant increase in responsibility and burden on caregivers. The study aimed to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention programme on the quality of life (QOL) and caregiver burden of the primary caregivers of women with breast cancer. This was a quasi-experimental study with 108 primary caregivers (54 in both intervention and control groups). The intervention comprised six 90-min educational sessions, held weekly. Topics included information about breast cancer, the emotional aspect of caring, adjustment to the role of caregiver and communication strategies. The intervention group received the psychosocial intervention programme in addition to routine care, and the control group received routine care. Primary outcome (caregiver burden) and caregiver QOL were measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CQOLC) at baseline, week six and week 12. The psychosocial intervention reduced caregiver burden at both T1 and T2 (p=0.000, p=0.018 respectively) and improved the caregiver QOL (p=0.000, p=0.020 respectively) in the intervention group compared to the control group.

Eighty-six subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=46) or control (n=40) groups. The intervention group received Baduanjin exercise 3 days/week at hospital and another 4 days/week at home for 6 months, whereas the control group were requested to maintain their original physical activity. Outcomes included body mass index (BMI), heart rate variability, lung capacity, arm circumference, shoulder range of motion, step test index, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL). Our findings indicate that Baduanjin is an effective intervention for improving physical and psychological health outcomes among breast cancer survivors, which is worth recommending and implementing by oncology nurses for breast cancer survivors during their long rehabilitation journeys. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Baduanjin exercise, which is a traditional Chinese Qigong exercise, in breast cancer survivors to assess its efficacy for physical and psychological rehabilitation. After 6 months of intervention, heart rate variability and shoulder range of motion were significantly improved in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group (P<0.05). There were also significant improvements in depression, QOL, and four QOL dimension scores (physical well-being, social well-being, functional well-being, and breast cancer subscale) (P<0.05).

In the intervention group, patients were provided training and given a training booklet describing ""exercise, massage and prevention methods"" by the researchers, as part of the Self-Management of Lymphedema Program. Patients were followed by telephone for 6 months and through monthly clinical check-ups. Patients in the intervention and control groups were evaluated in both the pre-operative and post-operative periods (at one, three and six months) using the ""DASH"", ""Measurement of Upper Extremity"", "" EORTC QLQ-30 and BR-23 questionnaire"". The Mann Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis H test, the Wilcoxon test, and the Friedman test were used for the statistical analysis of the data. At the end of the study, while lymphedema development was not observed in the intervention group, 61.2% of the control patients developed lymphedema. The difference between the intervention and control groups for the development of lymphedema was found to be statistically significant (χ2=25,943; p=0,000). The quality of life of the intervention group was higher than that of the control group. Moreover, the symptom scores of the intervention group were found to be significantly lower than those of the control group. As a result of our research, it can be concluded that the Self-Management of Lymphedema Program is effective at preventing lymphedema development following breast cancer treatment.

Classical massage was applied to the patients in the CMG before each paclitaxel infusion. The CG received only usual care. Presence of peripheral neuropathic pain and QOL were assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) findings were also recorded at baseline and week 12. The peripheral neuropathic pain was lower in the CMG compared to the CG at week 12 (p<0.05). The sensory and motor sub-scale scores of the QOL measure showed statistically significant differences over time in favor of the CMG (p<0.05). Sensory action potential amplitude of the median nerve was significantly higher and the tibial nerve latency was significantly shorter in the CMG compared to the CG at week 12. This assessor-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial aimed at investigating the effect of classical massage on chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and the quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant paclitaxel.

Smokers (≥20 cigarettes/day) were randomly classified into four subgroups (10 people/group) and were given 600mg/day of APS, 600mg/day of propolis, or 600mg/day of the mixture of APS (420mg/day) and propolis (180mg/day) for four weeks. Urinary excretion of BaP and cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) increased in a time-dependent manner increased after supplementation with APS (BaP, 2.23-fold; cotinine, 2.64-fold), propolis (BaP, 1.30-fold; cotinine, 2.08-fold), and the mixture (BaP, 2.33-fold; cotinine, 2.28-fold) compared with smoker control. Creatinine, glucose, and total bilirubin levels significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner after supplementation with APS (creatinine, 15.24%; glucose, 40.22%; total bilirubin, 48.82%), propolis (creatinine, 16.83%; glucose, 36.25%; total bilirubin, 52.59%), and the mixture (creatinine, 16.36%; glucose, 46.37%; total bilirubin, 39.20%) (p<0.05).

128,42872,Characteristics and effectiveness of complex nursing interventions aimed at reducing symptom burden in adult patients treated with chemotherapy: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,International journal of nursing studies,24074939,"We included 11 studies, some with considerable risk of bias. Despite being heterogeneous, the interventions have patient education, symptom assessment and coaching in common. Although some interventions fail to show significant effects, others significantly reduce aspects of symptom burden by 10-88%. The multiplicity and complexity of symptoms in patients treated with chemotherapy requires multifaceted symptom management interventions. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the characteristics and evaluate the effectiveness of complex nursing interventions that target multiple symptoms in patients receiving chemotherapy. We searched Medline, Embase, Cinahl and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials that compared complex nursing interventions to usual care and that provided data on symptom prevalence, severity, distress or limitations. Characteristics of the interventions were described in a narrative way. Regarding the effectiveness of the interventions, ratios of means were calculated in order to present data in a comparable and clinically interpretable way. Although some complex nursing interventions in this systematic review produce clinically meaningful and statistically relevant reductions in symptom burden, based on the available data it is not possible to make definitive conclusions about the vital parts, circumstances or preferred target population of the interventions. Quality of the studies and modeling and piloting of the interventions are important challenges for future research.

The outcomes of the study (self-efficacy, symptom distress, anxiety, depression and quality of life) were compared at baseline, three and six months after the intervention. The nurse-led self-efficacy enhancing intervention was effective in promoting self-efficacy and psychological well-being in patients with colorectal cancer, compared with standard care. The intervention can be incorporated into routine care. Future empirical work is required to determine the longer term effects of the intervention. Sixty-eight participants in the intervention group and 53 in the control group completed the study. Their mean age was 53 (SD=11.3). Repeated measure MANOVA found that the patients in the intervention group had significant improvement in their self-efficacy (F=7.26, p=0.003) and a reduction of symptom severity (F=5.30, p=0.01), symptom interference (F=4.06, p=0.025), anxiety (F=6.04, p=0.006) and depression (F=6.96, p=0.003) at three and six months, compared with the control group. However, no statistically significant main effect was observed in quality of life perception between the two groups. One hundred and fifty-two Chinese adult patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer were recruited. The intervention group (n=76) received self-efficacy-enhancing intervention and the control group (n=76) received standard care. Colorectal cancer is a major public health problem. There is growing support for colorectal cancer survivors who are experiencing problems after cancer treatment to engage in self-management programs to reduce symptom distress.

130,42882,Encouraging early discussion of life expectancy and end-of-life care: A randomised controlled trial of a nurse-led communication support program for patients and caregivers.,International journal of nursing studies,27912108,"Communication support program recipients gave significantly more cues for discussion of prognosis, end-of-life care, future care options and general issues not targeted by the intervention during recorded consultations, but did not ask more questions about these issues or overall. Oncologists' question prompt list and question asking endorsement was inconsistent. Communication support program recipients' self-efficacy in knowing what questions to ask their doctor significantly improved at follow-up while control arm patients' self-efficacy declined. The communication support program did not impact patients' health-related quality-of-life or the likelihood that their health information or shared decision-making preferences would be met. Satisfaction with the communication support program was high. The communication support program included guided exploration of a question prompt list, communication challenges, patient values and concerns and the value of discussing end-of-life care early, with oncologists cued to endorse question-asking and question prompt list use. Patients were randomised after baseline measure completion, a regular oncology consultation was audio-recorded and a follow-up questionnaire was completed one month later. Communication, health-related quality-of-life and satisfaction measures and a manualised consultation-coding scheme were used. Descriptive, Mixed Modelling and Generalised Linear Mixed Modelling analyses were conducted using SPSS version 22. This trial was conducted at six cancer treatment centres affiliated with major hospitals in Sydney, Australia. 110 patients with advanced, incurable cancer participated. To evaluate the efficacy of a nurse-facilitated communication support program for patients with advanced, incurable cancer to assist them in discussing prognosis and end-of-life care. Patients are often not given the information needed to understand their prognosis and make informed treatment choices, with many consequently experiencing less than optimal care and quality-of-life at end-of-life. A parallel-group randomised controlled trial design was used. Given the importance of clarifying prognostic expectations and end-of-life care wishes in the advanced cancer context, the communication support program appears to be an effective and well-received solution to encourage early information seeking related to these issues though, its long-term impact remains unclear. The manualised nature of the intervention, designed with existing clinical staff in mind, may make it suited for implementation in a clinical setting, though additional work is needed to identify why question asking was unaffected and establish its impact later in the illness trajectory.

The axillary vein blood flow parameters in the control group were lower than those in the two exercise groups at day 21 (all, p<0.05). However, no significant differences occurred in the incidence of venous thrombosis and axillary vein blood flow parameters between the two exercise groups. Peripherally-inserted central catheter-related venous thrombosis has serious complications including the loss of vascular access, recurrent venous thrombosis, and post-thrombotic syndrome. Current guidelines recommend non-pharmacological strategies to prevent peripherally-inserted central catheter-related venous thrombosis.

Of these, 12 were randomized controlled trials. Across the studies, dysphagia treatments varied by exercise type and start time (ie, before or during C/RT, n = 14; immediately after C/RT, n = 1; >3 months after C/RT, n = 5). After treatment, the outcomes measured varied by domain, tools, and follow-up schedule (ie, immediately after, n = 6; within 3 months after, n = 9, >3 months after, n = 12). All articles had risks of bias and most often lacked report of sample size calculations (n = 18), controlled clinician-participant interaction time across groups (n = 13), and treatment details to allow duplication (n = 9). The meta-analysis revealed physiological or functional, but not QOL, benefits after interventions with early and late start times. Given that benefit was identified with both early and late interventions, future high-quality trials are needed to clarify the most effective time, type, and intensity of behavioral dysphagia interventions for these HNC patients. Patients undergoing radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy (C/RT) for head and neck cancer (HNC) often develop dysphagia. Interventions from speech-language pathologists aim to maintain or improve swallow physiology and function. However, it is unclear which interventions provide the greatest benefit.

135,46219,Individual difference variables and the effects of progressive muscle relaxation and analgesic imagery interventions on cancer pain.,Journal of pain and symptom management,18504089,"Clinicians in acute care settings are often called upon to manage cancer pain unrelieved by medications. Cognitive-behavioral strategies, such as relaxation and imagery, are recommended for cancer pain management; however, there appear to be individual differences in their effects. This pilot study examined variation in pain outcomes achieved with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and analgesic imagery interventions among hospitalized patients with cancer pain, and assessed the influence of four individual difference variables (cognitive ability, outcome expectancy, previous experience, and concurrent symptoms) on pain relief achieved with each intervention. A crossover design was used in which 40 hospitalized cancer patients received two trials of PMR, two trials of analgesic imagery, and two trials of a control condition. In comparing means between treatment and control conditions, both PMR and analgesic imagery produced greater improvements in pain intensity, pain-related distress, and perceived control over pain than the control condition. However, individual responder analysis revealed that only half of the participants achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in pain with each intervention. Patients who achieved a meaningful improvement in pain with analgesic imagery reported greater imaging ability, more positive outcome expectancy, and fewer concurrent symptoms than those who did not achieve a meaningful reduction in pain. Similar relationships were not significant for the PMR intervention. Investigators should continue efforts to identify factors that moderate the effects of cognitive-behavioral pain coping strategies so that clinicians can identify the most beneficial treatments for individual patients.

Specialized palliative care (SPC) may support patients remaining at home. The intervention did not prevent hospital admissions. Likely, any intervention effects were outweighed by increased identification of problems in the intervention group leading to hospital admissions. Overall, patients and caregivers felt safe in their current place of care. During the study, 340 patients were randomized and 322 were included in modified intention-to-treat analyses. Overall, there were no significant differences in hospital admissions between the groups. The intervention group had more admissions triggered by worsened general health (22% vs. 16%, P = 0.0436) or unmanageable home situation (8% vs. 4%, P = 0.0119). After diagnostics, admissions were more often caused by clinical symptoms of cancer without progression in the intervention group (11% vs. 7%, P = 0.0493). The two groups did not differ significantly in overall potentially avoidable admissions. Both groups felt mostly safe about their place of care. These are secondary results of Domus: a randomized controlled trial of accelerated transition to SPC with psychological intervention at home (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01885637).

Tai Chi exercise is conducive to alleviate CRF in NPC patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy. The improvement in ANS balance might fit into the process of Tai Chi for CRF management in this population. One hundred fourteen patients were recruited in this study, and 83 patients completed the trial. The Tai Chi group and the control group had comparable baseline characteristics. After chemoradiotherapy, the Tai Chi group exhibited lower MFSI-SF total score and three negative subscale (general, physical, and emotional fatigue) scores and higher vigor score compared with the control group (P < 0.01 for all). The nLF/nHF ratio was significantly lower in the Tai Chi group compared to the control group after chemoradiotherapy. The MFSI-SF total score was markedly correlated with the nLF/nHF ratio. A randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi exercise was conducted from January 2014 to August 2015. Participants in the Tai Chi group practiced Tai Chi a one-hour session, five sessions/week during chemoradiotherapy. Participants in the control group received usual care.

To evaluate intervention content, participants performed intervention exercises and then participated in semistructured interviews and completed written evaluations. In the single-arm trial, four intervention sessions were delivered over two weeks, focusing on cultivating mindfulness, interpersonal connection, gratitude, and purpose. Newly recruited couples completed measures of depressive symptoms, cancer distress, spiritual well-being, and sleep disturbances before and after the intervention. This formative research aimed at examining the intervention's acceptability and initial efficacy in patients with metastatic lung cancer undergoing treatment and their spouses. Based on these results, the CBMB intervention appears to be acceptable and subjectively useful. In addition, we observed preliminary evidence of quality of life gains in both patients and their partners. Content evaluations by seven dyads of patients and their partners revealed high acceptability ratings for the CBMB intervention (e.g., all participants would recommend the intervention). Consent and adherence rates (54% and 67%, respectively) were acceptable in the single-arm trial. All patients (n = 7 dyads; 67% male; mean age, 55 years) and partners (33% male; mean age, 59 years) rated the intervention as useful. Paired t-test analyses revealed large effect sizes for reduced sleep disturbances (d = 1.83) and medium effect sizes for cancer-specific distress (d = 0.61) for patients and large effect sizes for depressive symptoms (d = 0.90) for partners. Given the generally incurable nature of metastatic lung cancer, patients and their spouses/partners are at risk for psychological and spiritual distress.

The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of magnesium sulfate supplementation on the incidence of hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypocalcemia during four cycles of TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant radiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin and cetuximab. Twenty-five patients included in a phase II prospective study received routine magnesium sulfate infusions before each cycle of cisplatin, and additional supplementation based on laboratory findings. During TPF, the incidence of grade 1/2 and grade 3/4 hypomagnesemia was 16% and 4%, respectively; and increased despite magnesium supplementation during CRT to 72% and 8%, respectively. During TPF, a grade 2 and grade 4 hypocalcemia occurred in 8% and 4%, respectively; and during CRT, it reached 36% (grade 1/2). Grade 1 hypokalemia only was observed during TPF (4%) and CRT (8%). The median amounts of supplemented magnesium sulfate during TPF and CRT were 20 mEq and 50 mEq, respectively. It appears that a low incidence of grade 3/4 hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia in our patients resulted from intensive magnesium supplementation. Thorough measurements of magnesium and calcium during cisplatin-based chemoradiation protocols in patients with head and neck cancer are crucial in preventing the development of grade 3/4 hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia.

Fifteen randomized controlled trails were eligible. The result showed that Huachansu combined with chemotherapy was superior to simple chemotherapy treatment in increasing of total response rate [RR = 1.28; 95% CI: (1.11, 1.18)] and Karnofsky score [RR = 1.31; 95% CI: (1.18, 1.45)], and reducing gastrointestinal side effects [RR = 0.71; 95% CI: (0.61, 0.82)], and leucocytopenia [RR = 0.75; 95% CI: (0.64, 0.87)]; there was no significant difference on one-year survival rate (RR = 1.25; 95% CI: 0.73, 2.14) between combination group and simple chemotherapy group. The main efficacy measures were total response rates, quality of life and one-year survival rate. We also assessed the safety of treatments by evaluating the rate of occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects, leucocytopenia and neurotoxicity. The pooled relative ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was calculated to estimate the efficacy and safety of Huachansu combined with chemotherapy. Huachansu, a Chinese medicine that comes from dried toad venom from the skin glands of Bufo bufo gargarizans Cantor or Bufo melanostictus Schneider, has been used in treatment of cancers.

They were randomized to 30 mL/d of FO, which provided 4.9 g of eicosapentaenoic acid and 3.2 g of docosahexanoic acid, or 18 mg/d of MLT for 4 wk. During the next 4 wk, all patients had FO and MLT. Serum or plasma was analyzed for tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 and the fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexanoic acid, arachidonic acid, and linoleic acid. The effect of fish oil (FO), melatonin (MLT), or their combination and dietary advice on cachexia and biochemistry variables reflecting cachexia were investigated in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Serum levels of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acid increased as expected with FO. No major changes in biochemical variables and cytokines were observed with any intervention. In the FO group, 5 of 13 patients (38%) showed weight stabilization or gain compared with 3 of 11 patients (27%) in the MLT group. After combining interventions, approximately 63% of patients showed such responses. FO, MLT, or their combination did not induce major biochemical changes indicative of a strong anticachectic effect.

142,49333,Omega-3 supplementation with resistance training does not improve body composition or lower biomarkers of inflammation more so than resistance training alone in older men.,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",30527263,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3.0 g/d of omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation combined with progressive resistance training to improve body composition and lower inflammatory cytokines in older men when compared to placebo and resistance training. We hypothesized that completing a 12-week omega-3 supplementation period along with whole body resistance exercise (3 times/wk) would result in a significantly greater improvement in lean tissue mass as well as a significant decrease in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α when compared to placebo. A total of 23 older men (≥65years old) were randomized to an omega-3 supplementation group (n=11) or placebo group (n=12), and all the participants completed the same whole body progressive resistance training program. Baseline and 12-week data collection included body composition, muscle strength, functional ability, and inflammatory cytokines. Results indicated a significant main effect for time (all P<.05) for percent body fat (-2.5%), lean tissue mass (+1.1%), lumbar bone mineral density (+1.1%), hip bone mineral content (+1.1%), chest press strength (+31%), leg press strength (+37%), timed-up-and-go (-6.6%), and 6-minute walk distance (+4.5%) from baseline to post 12weeks. No significant effects were noted for the 2 inflammatory cytokines measured (P>.05). We conclude that progressive resistance training exercise is an excellent method to enhance parameters of body composition, skeletal muscle strength, and functional ability in older men, whereas omega-3 supplementation did nothing to enhance these parameters or influence inflammatory biomarkers.

Lessons from a randomized controlled trial.,Patient education and counseling,29789176,"Since, unexpectedly, counselees already informed most of their relatives before the intervention was offered, efficacy of the intervention could not convincingly be determined. Counselees' knowledge about whom to inform about what is suboptimal. No between-group differences were found in participants' knowledge, motivation, and self-efficacy. Knowledge concerning which second-degree relatives to inform was lower compared to first-degree relatives. About 60% of the participants was of the opinion that they needed to inform more relatives than stated in their summary letter and only about 50% were correctly aware of which information to disclose. Of note, at baseline, almost 80% of the participants had already correctly informed their at-risk relatives. A randomized controlled trial was conducted aimed at improving cancer genetic counselees' i) knowledge, ii) motivation to disclose information, and ii) self-efficacy in this regard. Eligible participants were randomized to telephonic counseling (n=148), or standard care (n=157) and assessed at baseline, 1 week post-intervention, and 4 months after study enrolment. In hereditary and familial cancer, counselees are requested to inform their at-risk relatives. We developed an intervention to support counselees in this task. Future interventions should target a more homogeneous sample and address counselees' understanding and recall.

Main outcomes included perceived CRC risk, intent to be screened, and test preference, measured before and after viewing decision aid, and screening uptake at six months. Analyses were performed with ANCOVA and logistic regression. Compared to the Verbal arm, those in the Quantitative arm had a larger increase in intent to undergo FIT (p = 0.011) and were more likely to switch their preferred test from non-FIT to FIT (28% vs. 19%, p = .010). There were decreases in perceived risk in the Verbal Arm but not the Quantitative Arm (p = 0.004). There was no difference in screening uptake. Numeracy did not moderate any effects. Guidelines recommend that decision aids provide quantitative information about risks and benefits of available options. Impact of providing this information is unknown. Quantitative information may be useful but not essential for patients viewing decision aids. Quantitative information had relatively minor impact and no clearly negative effects, such as reducing uptake.

Research supports bibliotherapy as an efficacious intervention for a variety of mental health problems. Yet, few studies have investigated bibliotherapy in psychosocial oncology. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the efficacy of the NuCare intervention, delivered as a self-directed workbook, for enhancing empowerment, coping, and quality of life and reducing distress in patients with cancer. The increase of empowerment (main outcome) and quality of life and the decrease of distress in the NuCare group from pre-intervention to follow-up assessment differed significantly from the respective difference scores in the control group. Eighty-nine adult patients with cancer were randomized to receive the workbook for 6 weeks or the control condition, usual care. Participants completed questionnaires at baseline, 6 weeks post-baseline, and 10 weeks post-baseline. The self-administered NuCare workbook is a potentially cost-effective, minimal intervention addressing psychosocial needs of patients with cancer.

When children avoid general anesthesia the parents experienced less anxiety and costs for the hospital was lowered. The aim was to evaluate the impact of age-appropriate information and preparation procedures for children with cancer undergoing radiotherapy on 1) parents and family functioning, parents' anxiety and 2) hospital costs compared to traditional care. An un-matched quasi-experimental controlled clinical trial was conducted consisting of a control group including 31 parents of 16 children receiving traditional care and an intervention group including 32 parents of 17 children receiving age-appropriate preparation including seven parts. Validated instruments measured parents and family functioning and parents' anxiety. Hospital costs were calculated. Parents in the intervention group showed better communication throughout their child's radiotherapy (p=0.01) and at their child's last fraction, parental social functioning improved (p=0.02). Parents of children receiving general anesthesia, regardless of group, showed higher levels of anxiety (p=0.04). In general, results regarding hospital costs lacked statistical significance. Development of the intervention was calculated to be USD 4.624. Age-appropriate preparations consisting of basic, non-costly utilities and a structured approach are important. If more children are able to undergo radiotherapy without general anesthesia, it means for the individual child fewer risks and restrictions, and for the parents decreased anxiety. For the healthcare, it means lower costs, which enables the hospital to prioritize other areas of pediatric care.

To date, few randomized controlled trials have been conducted on the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for depressive and anxiety symptoms in Chinese population. This study aims to verify the efficacy of CBT in Chinese breast cancer survivors. Women (n=392) with breast cancer were randomly assigned to 3 groups: CBT (n=98), self-care management (SCM, n=98), and usual care (UC, n=196) using the proportion 1:1:2. Women in the CBT and SCM groups received a series of nine sessions for 12 weeks, while women in the UC group received their usual medical care only. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score at baseline, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks. A significant intergroup difference was found in the HAMD and HAMA scores. Women in the CBT group showed significantly less depressive and anxiety symptoms compared with women in the SCM and UC groups over time.

Pilot studies testing alpha-tocopherol and pentoxifylline provide evidence of clinical regression of superficial radiation fibrosis after radiotherapy. Despite only seeing four a priori defined responders in this pilot study testing dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate plus pentoxifylline in patients suffering complications of pelvic radiotherapy, changes in LENT SOMA scores suggest beneficial effects. However, we are not convinced that these effects are real, since no significant changes in symptoms and functional status were recorded by detailed prospective patient self-assessments. At 12 months post-registration there were 4 out of 23 responders. At 6 months post-registration there was a statistically significant improvement (i.e. reduction) in the median of the LENT SOMA summed scores in all areas assessed apart from 'male sexual dysfunction', 'vulva' and 'vagina' which were unchanged at 6 months. The median total LENT SOMA score at baseline and 6 months was 49 and 34, respectively, with a median change in total LENT SOMA score between baseline and 6 months of 9 (IQR 7-18) (P<0.001). The maximum LENT SOMA scores improved over the study period, with a total number of 82 maximum grade 3 or 4 normal tissue scores at baseline (median of four complications per person) reduced to a total number of 67 maximum grade 3 or 4 scores at 6 months post-registration (median of 3 complications per person), i.e. a median reduction in severe complications of one per person. LENT SOMA scores at 12 months were similar to those observed at 6 month suggesting no further improvement nor deterioration in late side effects. These findings were, however, not reflected in the patient self-assessment of function and quality of life, raising question about the possibility of observer bias in recording LENT SOMA scores. No significant changes were reported on magnetic resonance images at 6 months from baseline. Twenty-seven eligible research volunteers with a minimum of one grade 3 or 4 disability (LENT SOMA) due to previous radiotherapy were entered into the study. Volunteers were given dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate 500 mg twice a day orally plus pentoxifylline 400mg twice a day orally over a period of 6 months. Clinical assessment of late side effects recorded using LENT SOMA scales was selected as the primary endpoint, taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-registration.

Secondly and according to a Delphi method, we defined the content and size of a medical record, which could be held by the patient. Following these preliminary studies, we conducted a randomized controlled trial, comparing patients with usual follow-up to others holding the new record containing essential information for coordination of care. The patient-held record favoured membership and satisfaction of both patients and health professionals. It was used as a communication tool between physicians and patients, but could also cause anxiety to some patients. Patient quality of life, data confidentiality and costs of care remained identical in the two arms. With its benefits for both patients and healthcare professionals, a new concept of medical records was revealed by this study. New models for healthcare organization deeply modify the roles and relationships of all the actors in the healthcare system. Further research on patient-held records is needed to evaluate the full range of its benefits and limits.

150,51390,The effects of culturally targeted patient decision aids on medical consultation preparation for Hispanic women in the U.S.: Results from four randomized experiments.,Social science & medicine (1982),29990671,"Manipulation checks showed high awareness of cultural information in the targeted DA group. Despite efforts to rule out confounds that could account for null effects, DA cultural targeting did not increase knowledge, decision preparedness, or empowerment or reduce decision conflict in the four randomized experiments. Only individual difference variables (e.g., group interdependence) consistently predicted enhanced DA consultation preparation effects. Related research indicates that culture at the group level may exert less influence when individuals think deliberatively, feel less constrained by limited resources such as time, understand processing objectives, and/or are primed with task-specific schema/norms. Do culturally targeted patient decision aids (DAs) better prepare lower-middle and middle-class Hispanic American women for medical decision making compared to DAs designed for the general population? Health promotion evidence indicates that inclusion of cultural values, imagery, linguistics, and health data in a DA will improve ethnic patients' preparation relative to a generic DA; yet, this hypothesis remains untested. Given deeper deliberation and clearly primed processing objectives, personal experiences and task-related schema/norms may have significantly reduced the effects of cultural targeting. Consistent findings from four studies suggest that culturally targeted DAs may not better prepare Hispanic women in the U.S. for medical decision making than generic versions designed for the broader population. Four experiments examined consultation preparation effects of culturally targeted versus generic DAs for Hispanic women living in the United States. Drawing on highly rated online DAs, an experienced Hispanic content developer and Hispanic focus groups worked with researchers to develop culturally targeted digital DAs. Online panels of self-identified Hispanic women in the U.S. were randomly assigned to a targeted or generic DA as part of a scenario-based physician consultation for advanced diabetes (Study 1) or early stage breast cancer (Studies 2-4).

Because urinary diversion typically uses a segment of bowel, it is conceivable that patients undergoing cystectomy and diversion may benefit from gum chewing. This study aimed to determine whether gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period facilitates a return to bowel function in patients undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion. A total of 102 patients underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for clinically localized bladder cancer. Each patient followed our institution's perioperative cystectomy care plan. The first cohort of patients underwent surgery between July 2004 and August 2005 and served as a comparison (control) group in which no gum was dispensed. The second cohort underwent surgery during September 2005 to July 2006. These patients were given chewing gum to begin on postoperative day 1. Outcome measures included time to flatus, time to bowel movement, length of hospital stay, and complications. The time to flatus was shorter in patients who received gum compared with controls (2.4 versus 2.9 days; P <0.001). Also, time to bowel movement was reduced in patients who received gum (3.2 versus 3.9 days; P <0.001). There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay between gum-chewing patients and controls (4.7 versus 5.1 days, respectively; P = 0.067). Gum chewing was well tolerated in all patients. Gum chewing may speed the recovery of bowel function after cystectomy and diversion. These findings are consistent with outcomes in the colorectal surgery published data that support the use of chewing gum as an easy and inexpensive way to enhance recovery after surgery.

This modified model improved GC efficiency without negatively affecting psychosocial outcomes, providing an alternative strategy to meet the growing demand for genetic testing. Genetic testing identifies cancer patients who may benefit from targeted treatment and allows for enhanced cancer screening and risk-reduction in their at-risk relatives. Traditional models of genetic counseling (GC) cannot meet the increasing demand and urgency for genetic testing. The objective of this study was to evaluate a new model of service delivery to improve the efficiency of pre-test GC for panel-based genetic testing. A parallel, two-armed, randomized non-inferiority study compared traditional and modified pre-test GC models (1:2) prior to panel-based genetic testing. Participants were adult females, whose first-degree relative died of serous ovarian cancer. In the modified group, participants were emailed a 20-minute presentation prior to a scheduled pre-test GC telephone call. Psychosocial and knowledge questionnaires were provided at baseline (P1) and one week after pre-test GC (P2). 382 women completed pre-test GC (256 modified, 126 traditional). There were no differences in marital status, education level or household income. Pre-test GC time was shorter in the modified group (average 19 vs. 46min, p<0.001), with no difference in post-test GC time (average 16 min each, p=0.78).

Women rated their risk higher if they were under age 50 (P = 0.025) or had a first-degree family history of breast cancer (P = 0.0001), and rated their risk lower if they were Latina (P = 0.050) or Asian/other race/ethnicity (P = 0.013). Women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer in the intervention group significantly reduced their risk overestimate compared to those in the control group (-12.5 vs. 2.8 percentage points, P = 0.006). This intervention was unique because it was delivered in an ongoing service setting. It should be further tested in diverse populations.

The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of invitation to cervical cancer screening through a very low-cost strategy based on automated and customized text messages, phone calls and reminders. A randomized (1:1) controlled trial was conducted among 13 Portuguese primary care units, recruiting women aged 25 to 49years, eligible for cervical cancer screening, with an available mobile phone number. In the intervention group, participants were invited for cervical cancer screening through automated/customized text messages and phone calls, followed by text message reminders. Participants in the control group were invited through a written letter (standard of care). The primary outcome was the proportion of women adherent to screening up to 45days after invitation and the secondary outcome was defined as the adherence proportion after invitation based only on text messages and reminders. A total of 1220 women were randomized, 605 to intervention and 615 to control group. The adherence to cervical cancer was significantly higher among women assigned to intervention (39.0% vs. 25.7%, p<0.001); this corresponds to a difference of 13.3% (95% CI 8.1 to 18.5). The difference in adherence between an invitation strategy based only on text messages and reminders and the standard of care was -0.4%, 95% CI -5.3 to 4.5. In conclusion, an invitation to cervical cancer screening using automated text messages/phone calls and reminders increases the adherence to cervical cancer screening. Such a low-cost and operator-independent strategy of invitation may contribute to the sustainability of organized screening programs.

159,54332,Effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on plasma antioxidant concentrations and blood pressure: a randomised controlled trial.,"Lancet (London, England)",12076551,"High dietary intakes of fruit and vegetables are associated with reduced risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Short-term intensive dietary interventions in selected populations increase fruit and vegetable intake, raise plasma antioxidant concentrations, and lower blood pressure, but long-term effects of interventions in the general population are not certain. We assessed the effect of an intervention to increase fruit and vegetable consumption on plasma concentrations of antioxidant vitamins, daily fruit and vegetable intake, and blood pressure. We undertook a 6-month, randomised, controlled trial of a brief negotiation method to encourage an increase in consumption of fruit and vegetables to at least five daily portions. We included 690 healthy participants aged 25-64 years recruited from a primary-care health centre. Plasma concentrations of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, and ascorbic acid increased by more in the intervention group than in controls (significance of between-group differences ranged from p=0.032 to 0.0002). Groups did not differ for changes in lycopene, retinol, alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, or total cholesterol concentrations. Self-reported fruit and vegetable intake increased by a mean 1.4 (SD 1.7) portions in the intervention group and by 0.1 (1.3) portion in the control group (between-group difference=1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6; p<0.0001). Systolic blood pressure fell more in the intervention group than in controls (difference=4.0 mm Hg, 2.0-6.0; p<0.0001), as did diastolic blood pressure (1.5 mm Hg, 0.2-2.7; p=0.02). The effects of the intervention on fruit and vegetable consumption, plasma antioxidants, and blood pressure would be expected to reduce cardiovascular disease in the general population.

160,55989,Effect of early and systematic integration of palliative care in patients with advanced cancer: a randomised controlled trial.,The Lancet. Oncology,29402701,"From April 29, 2013, to Feb 29, 2016, we screened 468 patients for eligibility, of whom 186 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the early and systematic palliative care group (92 patients) or the standard oncological care group (94). Compliance at 12 weeks was 71% (65 patients) in the intervention group versus 72% (68) in the control group. The overall quality of life score at 12 weeks, by the EORTC QLQ C30, was 54·39 (95% CI 49·23-59·56) in the standard oncological care group versus 61·98 (57·02-66·95) in the early and systematic palliative care group (difference 7·60 [95% CI 0·59-14·60]; p=0·03); and by the MQOL Single Item Scale, 5·94 (95% CI 5·50-6·39) in the standard oncological care group versus 7·05 (6·59-7·50) in the early and systematic palliative care group (difference 1·11 [95% CI 0·49-1·73]; p=0.0006). In this randomised controlled trial, eligible patients were 18 years or older, and had advanced cancer due to a solid tumour, an European Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, an estimated life expectancy of 12 months, and were within the first 12 weeks of a new primary tumour or had a diagnosis of progression. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), by block design using a computer-generated sequence, either to early and systematic integration of palliative care into oncological care, or standard oncological care alone in a setting where all patients are offered multidisciplinary oncology care by medical specialists, psychologists, social workers, dieticians, and specialist nurses. The primary endpoint was change in global health status/quality of life scale assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (EORTC QLQ C30) at 12 weeks. The McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL), which includes the additional existential wellbeing dimension, was also used. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is ongoing, but closed for accrual, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01865396. The benefit of early integration of palliative care into oncological care is suggested to be due to increased psychosocial support. In Belgium, psychosocial care is part of standard oncological care. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to examine whether early and systematic integration of palliative care alongside standard psychosocial oncological care provides added benefit compared with usual care. The findings of this study show that a model of early and systematic integration of palliative care in oncological care increases the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer. Our findings also show that early and systematic integration of palliative care is more beneficial for patients with advanced cancer than palliative care consultations offered on demand, even when psychosocial support has already been offered. Through integration of care, oncologists and specialised palliative care teams should work together to enhance the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer.

161,56424,Efficacy of individual and group hypnotherapy in irritable bowel syndrome (IMAGINE): a multicentre randomised controlled trial.,The lancet. Gastroenterology & hepatology,30473202,"Hypnotherapy should be considered as a possible treatment for patients with IBS in primary and secondary care. Furthermore, group therapy could allow many more patients to be treated for the same cost. Hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been used primarily in patients with refractory symptoms in specialised departments and delivered on an individual basis. We aimed to test the hypothesis that hypnotherapy would be more effective than educational supportive therapy, and that group hypnotherapy would be non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy for patients with IBS referred from primary and secondary care. We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial (IMAGINE) in 11 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with IBS, aged 18-65 years, who were referred from primary or secondary care were randomly allocated (3:3:1) in blocks of six using a computer-based random number table procedure by staff not involved in the treatment to receive six sessions of individual or group hypnotherapy or group educational supportive therapy (control group). The primary outcome was adequate relief of IBS symptoms, with responders defined as patients who reported adequate relief when asked once weekly on three or four occasions in 4 consecutive weeks. We compared hypnotherapy (both groups) with control in the intention-to-treat population (excluding individuals subsequently found to be ineligible for enrolment), and assessed non-inferiority of group hypnotherapy versus individual hypnotherapy in the per-protocol population (with a non-inferiority margin of 15%) at 3 months and 12 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN22888906, and is completed. Between May 31, 2011, and April 6, 2016, 494 patients referred for psychological treatment for IBS were assessed for eligibility, of whom 354 were randomly allocated to the three groups: 150 to individual hypnotherapy, 150 to group hypnotherapy, and 54 to educational supportive therapy. After exclusion of individuals subsequently found to be ineligible for enrolment, 142 patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 146 in the group hypnotherapy group, and 54 in the control group were included in the intention-to-treat population. Of these, 22 (15%) patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 22 (15%) in the group hypnotherapy group, and 11 (20%) in the control group dropped out before or during therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the adequate response rate was 40·8% (95% CI 31·7-50·5) in the individual hypnotherapy group, 33·2% (24·3-43·5) in the group hypnotherapy group, and 16·7% (7·6-32·6) in the control group at 3 months. At 12 months, 40·8% (31·3-51·1) of patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 49·5% (38·8-60·0) of patients in the group hypnotherapy group, and 22.6% (11·5-39·5) of patients in the control group reported adequate relief. Hypnotherapy was more effective than control at 3 months (odds ratio 2·9, 95% CI 1·2-7·4, p=0·0240) and 12 months (2·8, 1·2-6·7, p=0·0185). In the per-protocol analysis, 49·9% (39·2-60·6) in the individual hypnotherapy group and 42·7% (32·3-53·8) in the group hypnotherapy group had adequate relief at 3 months, and 55·5% (43·4-67·1) of individual and 51·7% (40·2-63·0) of group hypnotherapy patients reported adequate relief at 12 months. Group hypnotherapy was therefore non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy. Eight unexpected serious adverse reactions (six in the individual hypnotherapy group and two in the group hypnotherapy group) were reported, most of which were cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, and were judged by the medical ethics committee as not being related to the therapy.

162,56523,Postoperative symbiotic in patients with head and neck cancer: a double-blind randomised trial.,The British journal of nutrition,29277158,"Studies on the 'gut origin of sepsis' have suggested that stressful insults, such as surgery, can affect intestinal permeability, leading to bacterial translocation. Symbiotics have been reported to be able to improve gut permeability and modulate the immunologic system, thereby decreasing postoperative complications. Therefore we aimed to evaluate the postoperative use of symbiotics in head and neck cancer surgical patients for intestinal function and permeability, as well as the postoperative outcomes. Patients were double-blind randomised into the symbiotic (n 18) or the control group (n 18). Samples were administered twice a day by nasoenteric tube, starting on the 1st postoperative day until the 5th to 7th day, and comprised 109 colony-forming units/ml each of Lactobacillus paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis plus 6 g of fructo-oligosaccharides, or a placebo (6 g of maltodextrin). Intestinal function (day of first evacuation, total stool episodes, stool consistency, gastrointestinal tract symptoms and gut permeability by diamine oxidase (DAO) enzyme) and postoperative complications (infectious and non-infectious) were assessed. Results of comparison of the pre- and postoperative periods showed that the groups were similar for all outcome variables. In all, twelve patients had complications in the symbiotic group v. nine in the control group (P>0·05), and the preoperative-postoperative DAO activity ranged from 28·5 (sd 15·4) to 32·7 (sd 11·0) ng/ml in the symbiotic group and 35·2 (sd 17·7) to 34·1 (sd 12·0) ng/ml in the control group (P>0·05).

The Domus RCT will provide evidence of the efficacy of a novel model of multidisciplinary SPC. ABSTRACTObjective:Patients with incurable cancer and their informal caregivers have numerous psychological and psychosocial needs. Many of these patients wish to receive their care and die at home. Few home-based specialized palliative care (SPC) interventions systematically integrate psychological support. We present a psychological intervention for patient-caregiver dyads developed for an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) of home-based SPC, known as Domus, as well as the results of an assessment of its acceptability and feasibility. The Domus model of SPC for patients with incurable cancer and their caregivers offered systematic psychological assessment and dyadic intervention as part of interdisciplinary care. Through accelerated transition to SPC, the aim of the model was to enhance patients' chances of receiving care and dying at home. Integration of psychological support sought to facilitate this goal by alleviating distress in patients and caregivers. Psychologists provided needs-based sessions based on existential-phenomenological therapy. Feasibility and acceptability were investigated by examining enrollment, nonparticipation, and completion of psychological sessions. Enrollment in the RCT and uptake of the psychological intervention indicated that it was feasible and acceptable to patients and caregivers. The strengths of the intervention included its focus on dyads, psychological distress, and existential concerns, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration and psychological interventions offered according to need. Its main limitation was a lack of an intervention for other family members. Caregivers Clinical Protocols Home Care Services Humans Neoplasms Patients Stress, Psychological",1

Using a convenience sampling method, we randomly assigned the participants to two groups: control (n = 45) and intervention (n = 45). Data were collected through the Spielberger's anxiety scale and a demographic questionnaire. Maternal anxiety was measured before the intervention, immediately after the three-day intervention, and five weeks after the intervention. We used a writing technique in the intervention and control groups for 20 minutes over three consecutive days. In the intervention group, participants wrote down their sincere desires and wishes that they demanded from God without any worry or stress. The control group spent 20 minutes writing their normal daily schedules; for example, feeding their children or changing their children's clothes. During the three consecutive days of intervention, we asked both groups not to worry about grammar or spelling errors. Finally, the data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistical methods.ResultA statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (intervention and control mean, 34.9 ± 9.9 and 47.9 ± 16.2, respectively) relative to anxiety after the intervention (p &lt; 0.001).

The study was designed as a nonrandomized controlled trial. The study took place between January 2015 and July 2015 in a hematology and oncology ward and two palliative care units in Japan. Among 54 eligible patients with advanced cancer, 46 were recruited (24 in the control group vs. 22 in the intervention group). The intervention group received spiritual care using SpiPas and usual care; the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual (FACIT-Sp). The secondary outcomes were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Comprehensive Quality of Life Outcome (CoQoLo).ResultA total of 33 (72%) and 23 (50%) patients completed 2- and 3-week follow-up evaluations, respectively.

Furthermore, it is unclear which components of multimodal interventions account for such effects. To address these issues, the authors tested a 10-week group cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention among 199 women newly treated for nonmetastatic breast cancer, following them for 1 year after recruitment. The intervention reduced reports of social disruption and increased emotional well-being, positive states of mind, benefit finding, positive lifestyle change, and positive affect for up to 12 months (indeed, some effects strengthened over time). With respect to mechanisms tested, the intervention increased confidence in being able to relax at will. There was also evidence that effects of the intervention on the various outcomes examined were mediated by change in confidence about being able to relax. Thus, this intervention had beneficial effects on diverse aspects of quality of life after treatment for breast cancer, which appear linked to a specific stress management skill taught in the intervention.

Both interventions resulted in immediate positive effects on future sun protection intentions. Both interventions showed objective evidence of less skin darkening at the postsummer follow-up, with those in the photoaging information condition also reporting more sun protective behavior and continuing to show less skin darkening 1 year after intervention. There was also evidence that effects of photoaging information on subsequent skin color change were mediated by the earlier positive effect photoaging information had on participants' intentions to sun protect and their subsequent sun protection behaviors.

Furthermore, it is unknown whether interventions also yield long-term positive changes. The present study experimentally tests if an intervention delivered at cancer diagnosis could yield broad, long-term, changes in domains such as relationships, worldview, priorities, and goals. It was hypothesized that the intervention group would report more positive and fewer negative life changes during survivorship versus the control group. Adding support for efficacy, BBI survivors reported significantly more positive life changes since diagnosis than survivors not receiving BBI. More generally, heightened stress/depressive symptoms at diagnosis foretold survivors' reporting of more negative changes.

The aims of this study were to examine the effects of magnesium supplementation on predicted outcome of treatment, rate of response to treatment and toxicity of treatment. Sixteen patients with testicular cancer were studied in detail over a 14 month period. One patient with an ovarian dysgerminoma was also included in the study. Eight patients were randomised to receive magnesium supplements both intravenous and oral; nine did not. The non-supplemented group showed significantly greater renal tubular damage as assessed by urine N-acetyl-B-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). There was a trend towards a reduction in treatment delays due to neutropenic episodes in the supplemented group, and serum magnesium concentrations remained significantly higher. Neither group showed differences in tumour growth rates or outcome. These results show that magnesium supplements are of considerable benefit and show no harmful effects in patients receiving cis-platin treatment. It is is suggested that magnesium supplements should be a routine part of the treatment regime, and that these should comprise both i.v. supplements during treatment and oral supplements between courses.

The RT Prepare intervention comprised two consultations with a radiation therapist: prior to treatment planning and on the first day of treatment. Radiation therapists focused on providing sensory and procedural information and addressing patients' pre-treatment anxiety. Usual care data were collected prior to intervention commencement. Data collection occurred: after meeting their radiation oncologist, prior to treatment planning, first day of treatment and after treatment completion. Multilevel mixed effects regression models were used. In total, 218 usual care and 190 intervention patients participated. Compared with usual care, intervention participants reported lower psychological distress at treatment commencement (p = 0.01); lower concerns about radiotherapy (p < 0.01); higher patient knowledge (p < 0.001); higher preparedness for procedural concerns (p < 0.001) and higher preparedness for sensory-psychological concerns at treatment planning (p < 0.001). Mean within-trial costs per patient were estimated at $AU159 (US$120); mean ongoing costs at $AU35 (US$26).

A possible imbalance or deficiency of essential fatty acids is suggested by reported beneficial effects of fish oil supplementation. To assess fatty acid status (composition of plasma and neutrophil phospholipids) in advanced cancer patients before and after 14 days of supplementation (12+/-1 g day(-1)) with fish (eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo (olive) oil. Blood was drawn from cancer patients experiencing weight loss of >5% body weight (n=23). Fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids and the major phospholipid classes of isolated neutrophils were determined using gas liquid chromatography. At baseline, patients with advanced cancer exhibited low levels (<30% of normal values) of plasma phospholipids and constituent fatty acids and elevated 20 : 4 n-6 content in neutrophil phospholipids. High n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratios in neutrophil and plasma phospholipids were inversely related to body mass index. Fish oil supplementation raised eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid content in plasma but not neutrophil phospholipids. 20 : 4 n-6 content was reduced in neutrophil PI following supplementation with fish oil. Change in body weight during the supplementation period related directly to increases in eicosapentaenoic acid in plasma. Advanced cancer patients have alterations in lipid metabolism potentially due to nutritional status and/or chemotherapy.

175,61187,Genetic nurse counsellors can be an acceptable and cost-effective alternative to clinical geneticists for breast cancer risk genetic counselling. Evidence from two parallel randomised controlled equivalence trials.,British journal of cancer,16832415,"This study compared genetic nurse counsellors with standard services for breast cancer genetic risk counselling services in two regional genetics centres, in Grampian region, North East Scotland and in Cardiff, Wales. Women referred for genetic counselling were randomised to an initial genetic counselling appointment with either a genetic nurse counsellor (intervention) or a clinical geneticist (current service, control). Participants completed postal questionnaires before, immediately after the counselling episode and 6 months later to assess anxiety, general health status, perceived risk and satisfaction. A parallel economic evaluation explored factors influencing cost-effectiveness. The two concurrent randomised controlled equivalence trials were conducted and analysed separately. In the Grampian trial, 289 patients (193 intervention, 96 control) and in the Wales trial 297 patients (197 intervention and 100 control) returned a baseline questionnaire and attended their appointment. Analysis suggested at least likely equivalence in anxiety (the primary outcome) between the two arms of the trials. The cost per counselling episode was 11.54 UK pounds less for nurse-based care in the Grampian trial and 12.50 UK pounds more for nurse-based care in Cardiff. The costs were sensitive to the grade of doctor (notionally) replaced and the extent of consultant supervision required by the nurse. In conclusion, care based on genetic nurse counsellors was not significantly different from conventional cancer genetic services in both trial locations.

176,61306,Lactobacillus supplementation for diarrhoea related to chemotherapy of colorectal cancer: a randomised study.,British journal of cancer,17895895,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is frequently associated with diarrhoea. We compared two 5-FU-based regimens and the effect of Lactobacillus and fibre supplementation on treatment tolerability. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (n=150) were randomly allocated to receive monthly 5-FU and leucovorin bolus injections (the Mayo regimen) or a bimonthly 5-FU bolus plus continuous infusion (the simplified de Gramont regimen) for 24 weeks as postoperative adjuvant therapy. On the basis of random allocation, the study participants did or did not receive Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG supplementation (1-2 x 10(10) per day) and fibre (11 g guar gum per day) during chemotherapy. Patients who received Lactobacillus had less grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea (22 vs 37%, P=0.027), reported less abdominal discomfort, needed less hospital care and had fewer chemotherapy dose reductions due to bowel toxicity. No Lactobacillus-related toxicity was detected. Guar gum supplementation had no influence on chemotherapy tolerability. The simplified de Gramont regimen was associated with fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse effects than the Mayo regimen (45 vs 89%), and with less diarrhoea. We conclude that Lactobacillus GG supplementation is well tolerated and may reduce the frequency of severe diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort related to 5-FU-based chemotherapy.

This pilot study investigated whether patients with no clinical or psychological abnormalities but severe fatigue would respond to an individually adapted aerobic exercise program. Participants were 12 patients (eight male, and four female patients), median age 47 years and 41 months post-HSCT with a variety of hematopoietic cancer diagnoses. All underwent a 12-week individualized mild aerobic exercise program, preceded by a 4-week introduction and baseline testing phase. Psychological measures included fatigue, mood and depression. Exercise-related physiological outcomes included power output at ventilatory threshold 2 (VT2) and associated changes in stroke volume, heart rate, blood lactate concentration and ratings of perceived exertion. Patients were assessed for fatigue before, immediately after and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-program. Significant improvements were found on both measures of fatigue (both P<0.001), with a very large effect size of 1.82 on the The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue Module, which were maintained over the follow-up period. Exercise testing revealed a mean increase (P<0.001) of 28% in power output at VT2 with an increase (P<0.001) in stroke volume and a decrease (P<0.001) in heart rate, blood lactate and perceived exertion at pre-intervention VT2 power output.

178,62924,Comparison of efficacy of simo decoction and acupuncture or chewing gum alone on postoperative ileus in colorectal cancer resection: a randomized trial.,Scientific reports,28102199,"To compared the ability of chewing gum or simo decoction (SMD) and acupuncture to reduce incidence of postoperative ileus (POI) after colorectal cancer resection, patients with colorectal cancer undergoing open or laparoscopic resection were randomized to receive SMD and acupuncture (n = 196), chewing gum alone (n = 197) or no intervention (n = 197) starting on postoperative day 1 and continuing for 5 consecutive days. Patients treated with SMD and acupuncture experienced significantly shorter hospital stay, shorter time to first flatus and shorter time to defecation than patients in the other groups (all P < 0.05). Incidence of grade I and II complications was also significantly lower in patients treated with SMD and acupuncture. Patients who chewed gum were similar to those who received no intervention in terms of hospital stay, incidence of complications, and time to first bowel motion, flatus, and defecation (all P > 0.05). The combination of SMD and acupuncture may reduce the incidence of POI and shorten hospital stay for patients with colorectal cancer after resection. In contrast, chewing gum does not appear to affect recovery of bowel function or hospital stay, though it may benefit patients who undergo open resection.

The primary endpoint was QOL scores; secondary endpoints were the toxicity and safety of the regimens. The NP/NC regimen caused mild (grade 1 or 2) non-hematologic toxic effects in the patients comprising vomiting (43.6%), fatigue (36.9%), pain (23%), dry mouth (27.6%) and diarrhea (7.9%). The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (0.57% vs 4.02%, P = 0.037). Transient severe (grade 3 or 4) hematological toxic effects occurred less often (hemoglobin reduction (11.9 vs 22.5 percent) and total bilirubin increased (to 42.1 vs 46.2%) in the intervention compared to the control group during the 2nd chemotherapy cycle.

180,63063,A Mediterranean diet does not alter plasma trimethylamine N-oxide concentrations in healthy adults at risk for colon cancer.,Food & function,30938383,"An elevated circulating level of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has been identified as a risk factor for numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colon cancer. TMAO is formed from trimethylamine (TMA)-precursors such as choline via the combined action of the gut microbiota and liver. We conducted a Mediterranean diet intervention that increased intakes of fiber and changed intakes of many other foods containing fat to increase the relative amount of mono-unsaturated fats in the diet. The Mediterranean diet is associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases and might counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of increased TMAO formation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if the Mediterranean diet would reduce TMAO concentrations. Fasting TMAO concentrations were measured before and after six-months of dietary intervention in 115 healthy people at increased risk for colon cancer. No significant changes in plasma TMAO or in the ratios of TMAO to precursor compounds were found in either the Mediterranean group or the comparison group that followed a Healthy Eating diet. TMAO concentrations exhibited positive correlations with age and markers of metabolic health. TMAO concentrations were not associated with circulating cytokines, but the relative abundance of Akkermansia mucinophilia in colon biopsies was modestly and inversely correlated with baseline TMAO, choline, and betaine serum concentrations. These results suggest that broad dietary pattern intervention over six months may not be sufficient for reducing TMAO concentrations in an otherwise healthy population. Disruption of the conversion of dietary TMA to TMAO should be the focus of future studies.

Three experts superimposed their delineations of BORN lesions on the videos using special tools. In phase one, 68 general endoscopists from 4 countries assessed 4 batches of 20 videos. After each batch, mandatory feedback compared the assessors' interpretations with those from experts. These data informed the selection of 25 videos for the phase 2 module, which was completed by 121 new assessors from 5 countries. A 5-video test batch was completed before and after scoring of the four 5-video training batches. Mandatory feedback was as in phase 1. Outcome measures were scores for detection, delineation, agreement delineation, and relative delineation of BORN. A linear mixed-effect model showed significant sequential improvement for all 4 outcomes over successive training batches in both phases. In phase 2, median detection rates of BORN in the test batch increased by 30% (P < .001) after training. From baseline to the end of the study, there were relative increases in scores of 46% for detection, 129% for delineation, 105% for agreement delineation, and 106% for relative delineation (all, P < .001). Scores improved independent of assessors' country of origin or level of endoscopic experience. We developed a web-based teaching tool for endoscopic recognition of BORN that is easily accessible, efficient, and increases detection and delineation of neoplastic lesions. Widespread use of this tool might improve management of Barrett's esophagus by general endoscopists. Endoscopic detection of early Barrett's esophagus-related neoplasia (BORN) is a challenge.

As many patients seek treatment of their own accord by physiotherapists, we considered it relevant to evaluate the effect of two different physiotherapy regimes. We also wished to determine whether there was a possible relationship between occurrence of late sequelae and physical findings, carried out by means of a simple clinical examination based on physiotherapeutic methods of examination. Fifty-nine patients, 1-4 years postoperatively, were randomized to two different physiotherapy regimens. Patients were examined by a physician before and after the treatment, and they answered a questionnaire four times in all within the course of the investigation. The questionnaire covered six main late sequelae, as well as the degree of discomfort. Our investigation shows that many women experience late symptoms after surgical treatment of breast cancer, and that is possible in these patients, to demonstrate a reduction in strength in the ipsilateral extremity, reduced movement and increased muscle tone. Physiotherapy can improve the strength, movement and muscle tone in the operated extremity and also reduce the presence and severity of the late symptoms.",1

In Germany, such programs were established as work-related medical rehabilitation (WMR). The study investigated whether WMR leads to better results compared to medical rehabilitation (MR). We report effects on secondary outcomes when the rehabilitation program was completed. From 232 planned randomized intervention groups, 165 (71%) were realized. In total, 476 patients were included. Mean age of participants was 50.7 years (SD=7.3). Most frequent primary diagnoses were malignant neoplasms of the breast. Participants in the WMR program reported significantly better outcomes regarding quality of life (SMD=0.17-0.25), fatigue (SMD=0.18-0.27), coping with illness (SMD=0.17-0.22), and self-reported work-ability (SMD=0.16) compared to participants in MR program (all p<0.05). The results indicate a positive effect in favor of WMR for cancer patients with an elevated risk of not returning to work at the end of their treatment. Clusters of participants were randomly assigned to WMR or MR. Patients of working age and an elevated risk of not returning to work were included.

To increase recruitment numbers inclusion criteria will be modified and participation costs will be reduced. 113 patients were personally addressed, of which four patients participated in the pilot group. Patients reported that the intervention fit very well with their daily life and expressed satisfaction with it. Three patients emphasized the importance of the peer. In a randomized controlled trial head and neck cancer patients either receive a group intervention or socio-legal counselling. Male head and neck cancer patients with elevated levels of psychological and work-related distress are included. The group intervention consists of eight sessions. Groups are led by both a psychotherapist and a former head and neck cancer patient (peer). Feasibility and acceptability of the group intervention were tested by means of a pilot group. Each session was evaluated by pilot group participants. Semi-structured interviews were used to assess relevance of content and practicability. Despite high distress the majority of head and neck cancer patients does not use any psycho-oncological counselling or psychotherapeutic support. Additionally, patients with head and neck cancer have an increased risk of not returning to work compared to other cancer patients. Therefore, we have developed a group intervention program which aims at improving work ability in patients with head and neck cancer as well as their quality of life, self-efficacy and psychological well-being.

187,64225,[Evaluation of a Vocationally Oriented Concept within Inpatient Oncological Rehabilitation].,Die Rehabilitation,23749615,"We evaluated an occupation-related rehabilitation program, which has been designed to enhance the return to work of cancer patients. As return to work plays an important role to get back to normalcy after suffering from cancer, there is a substantial need for support and evaluated programs. The study had a quasi-experimental design with an intervention group (IG) and a comparison group (CG). We defined performance-related outcomes (e. g. return to work, self-assessed working capacity), asked patients if they needed further vocational advice and how helpful they estimated the rehabilitation treatment. 1 year after the end of rehabilitation 309 employed patients had completed the study (65%). We addressed our research questions using non-parametric tests, t-tests, analyses of variance and logistic regressions. A high percentage of the patients return to work (78%). These results show the success of oncological rehabilitation in helping patients to return to work. In addition, the occupation-related rehabilitation program enhances subjective variables as the satisfaction of the patients regarding the information and the improvement of the patients' working-capacity. Of the 309 patients 58% started rehabilitation not later than 14 days after the end of acute treatment while the other 42% had finished their treatments at least some weeks or even months ago. Patients of the IG evaluated the work-related rehabilitation offers significantly better and needed less additional vocational advice after the end of rehabilitation (n. s.). Regarding the patients, who started rehabilitation not later than 14 days after the end of acute treatment (beginning of rehabilitation n=269, 12 months after rehabilitation n=174), the IG achieved a slightly higher return-to-work-rate 12 months after the end of rehabilitation (81% IG, 76% CG, n. s.).

To determine whether behavioral approaches for altering learned responses might be useful treatments for these symptoms, we compared the effects of ""systematic desensitization"" (a behavioral treatment in which relaxation is learned as a response to situations in which patients have had anticipatory nausea and vomiting) with those of counseling and of no treatment. Sixty ambulatory cancer patients with anticipatory nausea and vomiting before their third and fourth chemotherapy treatments were randomized equally to the three groups. Significantly more patients receiving desensitization reported no anticipatory nausea before their fifth and sixth chemotherapy treatments than patients given counseling (P less than 0.05) or no treatment (P less than 0.01). Desensitized patients also reported significantly less severe anticipatory nausea (P less than 0.01) and vomiting (P less than 0.05) and a shorter duration of anticipatory nausea (P less than 0.01). We conclude that systematic desensitization appears to have an antiemetic effect in cancer patients who receive chemotherapy, and may be useful in the management of these problems.

For 24 months, the patients were examined for the presence of new actinic keratoses by physicians unaware of their assigned diets. At base line, the mean (+/- SD) percentage of caloric intake as fat was 40 +/- 4 percent in the control group and 39 +/- 3 percent in the dietary-intervention group. After 4 months of dietary therapy the percentage of calories as fat had decreased to 21 percent in the dietary-intervention group, and it remained below this level throughout the 24-month study period. The percentage of calories as fat in the control group did not fall below 36 percent at any time. The cumulative number of new actinic keratoses per patient from months 4 through 24 was 10 +/- 13 in the control group and 3 +/- 7 in the dietary-intervention group (P = 0.001). In patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, a low-fat diet reduces the incidence of actinic keratosis. Actinic keratoses are premalignant lesions and are a sensitive and important manifestation of sun-induced skin damage.

With the use of a new automatic stoma valve (ASV) it appears possible to rehabilitate patients who have previously been unsuccessful in acquiring hands-free speech. As well as making daily ASV use possible for an additional group of patients, this new device was also appreciated by many patients as an additional rehabilitation tool for specific occasions. Despite statistically significant improvements in aspects of voice and breathing using this novel ASV, improvement of peristomal adhesion is probably the main factor needed to further increase success rates. Nevertheless, our results show that it makes sense to keep trying to achieve hands-free speech, even if previous attempts have failed. This was a prospective clinical multicentre trial in 79 laryngectomized patients (8 regular ASV users, 58 previously unsuccessful users and 13 new users). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 6 months by means of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaires and specific structured questionnaires concerning compliance, skin adhesion, voicing and pulmonary aspects. An objective assessment of voice parameters (maximum phonation time, maximum phonation time while counting, dynamic loudness range and number of pauses in a standard read-aloud text) was made for comparison of different stoma occlusion methods (digital occlusion via an HME and two different ASVs). A subjective assessment of overall voice quality was made. After 6 months, 19% of patients used the new ASV on a daily basis (mean 5 h/day), while 57% used it on an irregular basis as an additional rehabilitation tool for special occasions. Two-thirds of the study group indicated that they would continue to use the new ASV after the study period. With respect to the objective parameters, statistically significantly better maximum phonation times and dynamic loudness ranges were observed with the new ASV compared to the Blom-Singer ASV.

On this basis, we initiated a Phase I clinical trial of dietary MET restriction in association with chloroethylnitrosourea (cystemustine) treatment for patients with recurrent glioma or metastatic melanoma. Our purpose was 1) to determine the optimal MET-free diet duration for a maximum depletion of plasma MET and 2) to evaluate the feasibility of this association. A total of 10 patients received 4 cycles of 2 wk of an association of a MET-free diet of 1, 2, 3, or 4 consecutive days and cystemustine (60 mg/m(2)). For each cycle, plasma MET concentrations, nutritional status (weight, albumin, prealbumin) and toxicity were measured. Conversely, fed-state concentrations of plasma MET (12 AM) were reduced by dietary MET restriction, with an optimal depletion of 41% at the 1st day of MET-free diet without effect of the extending MET-free diet period. Indeed, we demonstrated the feasibility, that is, good diet acceptability and good tolerance (nutritional status and toxicity), of the association of a MET-free diet and cystemustine treatment. Based on these results, a Phase II clinical trial has been initiated to test the activity of the association of a 1-day MET-free diet with cystemustine treatment.

No grade II through IV toxicities were observed. During Weeks 0 through 4, mean daily lycopene intake for Group A was 43 mg (+/- 15 mg) and mean soy intake for Group B was 39 g (+/- 1 g), remaining similar during Weeks 4 through 8. Serum lycopene increased from 0.72 +/- 0.09 micromol/l to 1.21 +/- 0.10 micromol/l (P < 0.0001) and urinary isoflavone excretion increased from not detectable to 54.1 +/- 5.7 micromol/l (P < 0.05) with 8 wk of diet intervention. Serum prostate-specific antigen decreased between Weeks 0 and 8 for 14 / 41 men (34%). Mean serum vascular endothelial growth factor for the entire group was reduced from 87 to 51 ng/ml (P < 0.05) over 8 wk.

We aim to determine the EPA effect on body composition and pro-inflammatory markers in patients with head neck cancer. 32 patients received EPA (2 g/day) and 32 became controls. A decrease in serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ was observed in the experimental group, as well as regulation of body weight (-0.3 ± 5.9 vs. -2.1 ± 3.7), lean body mass (-0.2 ± 3.8 vs. -1.3 ± 3.6), body fat mass (0.2 ± 3.5 vs. -1.2 ± 3.8), and quality of life (10 ± 33 vs. 5 ± 34). A randomized single-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer who received a polymeric diet with 2 g of EPA or a standard polymeric diet for six weeks before antineoplastic treatment. We assessed body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis and determined IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ, CRP, serum proteins, and blood count at baseline and at the end of the study. Supplementing with 2 g/day of EPA to head and neck cancer patient during antineoplastic treatment regulates serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, body weight, lean body mass, and improve quality of life.

The purpose of this study was to examine the dietary parameters of a low-fat diet found to be effective in reducing occurrence of skin cancer. Skin cancer patients were taught fat reduction strategies to complement their individual food preferences and life-styles. Diet composition was calculated using standard dietary assessment and nutrient analysis techniques. The dietary intervention was effective in reducing the percentage of calories from fat to 21% by Month 4 and maintaining that level for the remainder of the two-year study. Practical dietary advice with respect to reduction of percentage of calories from fat, along with an increase in the intake of grains, fruits, and vegetables, could make an important contribution to the management and prevention of skin cancer.

197,66691,Immunomodulatory effect of beta-carotene on T lymphocyte subsets in patients with resected colonic polyps and cancer.,Nutrition and cancer,9290119,"Results from a number of studies suggest that beta-carotene-containing foods prevent the initiation or progression of various cancers. One possible mechanism for this effect could be enhancement of the immune response. The aim of this study was to determine whether beta-carotene modulates T lymphocyte subsets in patients affected with colonic polyps or cancerous lesions. Patients with previous adenomatous colonic polyps (n = 18) or colon cancers (n = 19) were randomized to receive placebo or beta-carotene (30 mg/day) for three months. Percentages of T lymphocyte subsets were determined using flow cytometry in blood samples collected before randomization and at three months. T lymphocyte subsets of 14 normal control subjects were also determined for comparison. Initially, there was no difference in total leukocyte counts, percentage of lymphocytes, and various subsets of lymphocytes among the three groups, although in cancer patients there was a lower percentage of CD4 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor-positive (IL-2R+) cells than in patients with polyps and in controls. After supplementation with beta-carotene, a significant increase in IL-2R+ T lymphocytes (from 12.7 +/- 3.0% to 26.0 +/- 1.9%) and CD4+ lymphocytes (from 40.9 +/- 3.1% to 45.6 +/- 3.2%) was seen only in the cancer patients. These percentages remained unchanged in patients with adenomatous polyps receiving placebo or beta-carotene. We concluded that beta-carotene increased the number of IL-2R+ T lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes, which in turn may produce IL-2 only in patients with cancer who may already have some deficiency in their immune system. This increase in activated T lymphocytes may mediate cytotoxic reactions to cancer cells via cytokine production.

198,66692,Feasibility of a randomized trial of a high-vegetable diet to prevent breast cancer recurrence.,Nutrition and cancer,9343838,"Epidemiologic evidence supports the concept that diet influences risk for breast cancer and suggests that prognosis after the diagnosis of breast cancer may also be related to modifiable nutritional factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a randomized trial of a high-vegetable, reduced-fat, and increased-fiber diet intervention to reduce risk for recurrence among breast cancer survivors. This major change in dietary pattern was promoted through intensive telephone counseling. Participants were 93 women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer (stages I, II, and IIIA) within the previous four years and who had completed their initial treatment. We assessed adherence to the study diet using repeated 24-hour dietary recalls at 6 and 12 months and measurement of circulating carotenoid concentrations. Six months after randomization, the intervention group had significantly increased their mean intake of vegetables (+4.6 servings/day), fruit (+0.7 servings/day), and fiber (+6.4 g/1,000 kcal) and significantly reduced their intake of dietary fat (-9.9% of energy) compared with the control group. Circulating concentrations of carotenoids also increased in the intervention group. These changes persisted at the 12-month visit. Results of this study demonstrate that telephone counseling can be a useful approach in diet intervention and that breast cancer survivors can adopt and maintain a high-vegetable, reduced-fat dietary pattern.

At each visit (baseline and 1.5, 3, 6, 9, 10.5, and 15 mo), blood samples were collected and the levels of six micronutrients were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. No limitations or changes were introduced in each participant's dietary habits. Cervico-vaginal lavage samples were also obtained at the same visit and assayed for the presence of human papillomavirus DNA by Southern blot hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. In the supplemented group, mean plasma beta-carotene levels were significantly higher (p = 0.0001) than baseline and remained markedly elevated for 15 months. In the longitudinal analysis of the placebo group, there were no variations among individual mean plasma levels of beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lycopene, retinol, gamma-tocopherol, or alpha-tocopherol, suggesting absence of seasonal or dietary changes. In the placebo group, cigarette smoking and steroid contraceptive use were significantly associated with low levels of plasma beta-carotene (p = 0.05 and p = 0.012, respectively). However, in contrast, in the beta-carotene-supplemented group, steroid contraceptive use had no influence on the plasma beta-carotene levels. An additional noteworthy finding was that beta-carotene supplementation did not reverse the depletion effect in smokers. There was no association between the plasma levels of these six micronutrients in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and persistent human papillomavirus infection status in the placebo or the supplemented groups. Functional sequential nutrient interactions with each other or with other essential micronutrients and possible long-term toxicity need to be addressed in clinical trials.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial testing a Vitamin D-based intervention to improve Vitamin D status and reduce bone density decline. Poor adherence to home supplementation necessitated a change to directly observed therapy (DOT) with intermittent, high-dose Vitamin D3 randomized versus standard of care (SOC). Compared to SOC, DOT Vitamin D3 successfully increased trough Vitamin 25(OH)D levels (p = .026) with no residual Vitamin D deficiency, 100% adherence to DOT Vitamin D3, and without associated toxicity. However, neither Vitamin D status nor supplementation impacted bone density. Thus, this adherence-optimized intervention is feasible and effective to correct Vitamin D deficiency in adolescents during ALL therapy.

Women smokers aged 20-64 years from two general practices in the United Kingdom were randomly assigned to receive an extended leaflet, a brief leaflet, or no leaflet. Both leaflets informed women of the threat of cervical cancer, how stopping smoking would decrease their vulnerability to it, and the effectiveness of smoking cessation services. The extended leaflet included an elaborated explanation of how smoking adversely affects the cervix. Questionnaires were completed by 172 women. The main outcome was readiness to stop smoking within the next 6 months. Secondary outcomes were perceptions of severity and vulnerability to cervical cancer, beliefs about the effectiveness of reducing susceptibility by stopping smoking, and self-efficacy in stopping smoking. Women sent the briefer leaflet were more likely to be ready to stop smoking within the next 6 months compared with those sent the extended leaflet (75% vs. 46%, 95% CI=11%-48%) and those not sent a leaflet (75% vs. 40%, 95% CI=19%-52%). Compared with smokers not sent a leaflet, those sent either of the two leaflets perceived their vulnerability to cervical cancer as higher and had greater expectations that stopping smoking would reduce this risk. In conclusion, providing women with brief written information about the link between smoking and cervical cancer increases their readiness to stop smoking. The impact on smoking cessation of combining such information with advice from health professionals conducting cervical screening needs to be evaluated.

No significant difference was seen in NK cell activity due to beta-carotene supplementation in the middle-aged group. The elderly men had significantly lower NK cell activity than the middle-aged men; however, there was no age-associated difference in NK cell activity in men supplemented with beta-carotene. beta-carotene-supplemented elderly men had significantly greater NK cell activity than elderly men receiving placebo. The reason for this is unknown; however, it was not due to an increase in the percentage of NK cells, nor to an increase in interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor expression, nor to IL-2 production. beta-carotene may be acting directly on one or more of the lytic stages of NK cell cytotoxicity, or on NK cell activity-enhancing cytokines other than IL-2, such as IL-12. Our results show that long-term beta-carotene supplementation enhances NK cell activity in elderly men, which may be beneficial for viral and tumoral surveillance.

One hundred forty-two smoking men aged 35-65 y were randomly assigned to one of the following seven treatments for 2 mo: 100 mg D-alpha-tocopheryl acetate plus 250 mg slow-release ascorbic acid twice a day (n = 20), 100 mg D-alpha-tocopheryl acetate twice a day (n = 20), 250 mg ascorbic acid twice a day (n = 21), 250 mg slow-release ascorbic acid twice a day (n = 21), 30 mg coenzyme Q10 in oil three times a day (n = 20), 30 mg coenzyme Q10 as granulate three times a day (n = 20), or placebo twice a day (n = 20). The trial outcome was the urinary excretion rate of 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG)-a repair product of oxidative DNA damage. Two months of supplementation did not result in significant changes in the urinary excretion rate of 8-oxodG in any group. The lack of effect of antioxidant supplementation on the excretion rate of 8-oxodG, despite substantial increases in plasma antioxidant concentrations, agrees with the results from recent large intervention studies with cancer as an endpoint. The cancer-protective effect of fruit and vegetables seems to rely not on the effect of single antioxidants but rather on other anticarcinogenic compounds or on a concerted action of several micronutrients present in these foods.

218,70114,Modulation of fecal markers relevant to colon cancer risk: a high-starch Chinese diet did not generate expected beneficial changes relative to a Western-type diet.,The American journal of clinical nutrition,9701196,"In a randomized, crossover dietary intervention study, 12 Australians (of white descent) consumed a diet typical of low-income communities in China and an average Australian diet so that effects on fecal markers thought to be relevant to colon cancer risk could be compared. The Chinese diet contained 35.3 g starch/MJ daily [including 2 g resistant starch (RS)/MJ and 1.5 g nonstarch polysaccharides (NSPs)/MJ]; the Australian diet contained 12 g starch/MJ daily (including 0.8 g RS and 2.7 g NSPs/MJ). Subjects followed each diet for 3 wk. Serum cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower after the low-fat, high-starch Chinese diet than after the Australian diet (mean +/- SEM: 4.17 +/- 0.30 compared with 5.04 +/- 0.28 mmol/L, respectively, P < 0.05), a difference indicative of dietary compliance. Fecal pH was lower after the Chinese diet (6.51 +/- 0.04) than after the Australian diet (6.63 +/- 0.05; P < 0.05). For all other fecal markers examined, however, the Chinese diet produced less favorable changes, including lower fecal bulk (86 +/- 11 compared with 141 +/- 20 g wet wt/d, P < 0.01), slower transit through the gut (69 +/- 6 compared with 56 +/- 7 h, P = 0.06), lower fecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids [72.8 +/- 7.3 compared with 98 +/- 7.6 mmol/L (including butyrate: 12.2 +/- 1.3 compared with 18.4 +/- 2.3 mmol/L), P < 0.05], and higher fecal concentrations of potentially damaging ammonia (540 +/- 50 compared with 450 +/- 40 mg/L, P < 0.01) and phenols (109.2 +/- 13.2 compared with 68.5 +/- 12.9 mg/L, P < 0.01). These results suggest that consumption of a high-starch diet alone is insufficient to reduce the risk of developing colon cancer.

219,70117,Effects of soy-protein supplementation on epithelial proliferation in the histologically normal human breast.,The American journal of clinical nutrition,9848512,"A high dietary intake of soy products (eg, as in Japan and Singapore) has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of breast cancer in premenopausal women. Phytoestrogens present in soybeans inhibit human breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and breast cancer development in animal models, but no data exist on the effects of phytoestrogens on histologically normal human breasts. This study examines the effects of dietary soy supplementation on the proliferation rate of premenopausal, histologically normal breast epithelium and the expression of progesterone receptor. Women (n = 48) with benign or malignant breast disease were randomly assigned to receive their normal diet either alone or with a 60-g soy supplement (containing 45 mg isoflavones) taken daily for 14 d. Biopsy samples of normal breasts were labeled with [3H]thymidine to detect the number of cells in S phase and were immunocytochemically stained for the proliferation antigen Ki67. The phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, equol, enterolactone, and enterodiol were measured in serum samples obtained before and after supplementation. Serum concentrations of the isoflavones genistein and daidzein increased in the soy group at 14 d. Results showed a strong correlation between Ki67 and the thymidine labeling index (r = 0.868, P < or = 0.001). The proliferation rate of breast lobular epithelium significantly increased after 14 d of soy supplementation when both the day of menstrual cycle and the age of patient were accounted for. Progesterone receptor expression increased significantly in the soy group. Short-term dietary soy stimulates breast proliferation; further studies are required to determine whether this is due to estrogen agonist activity and to examine the long-term effects of soy supplementation on the pituitary gland and breast.

These data indicate that partially defatted flaxseed is effective in lowering LDL cholesterol. No effects on lipoprotein ratios, ex vivo serum androgen or progestin activity, or protein carbonyl content were observed. The significance of increased oxidation of protein thiol groups with flaxseed consumption requires further investigation. Partially defatted flaxseed reduced total cholesterol (4.6+/-1.2%; P = 0.001), LDL cholesterol (7.6+/-1.8%; P < 0.001), apolipoprotein B (5.4+/-1.4%; P = 0.001), and apolipoprotein A-I (5.8+/-1.9%; P = 0.005), but had no effect on serum lipoprotein ratios at week 3 compared with the control. There were no significant effects on serum HDL cholesterol, serum protein carbonyl content, or ex vivo androgen or progestin activity after either treatment. Unexpectedly, serum protein thiol groups were significantly lower (10.8+/-3.6%; P = 0.007) at week 3 after the flaxseed treatment than after the control, suggesting increased oxidation. Twenty-nine hyperlipidemic subjects (22 men and 7 postmenopausal women) completed two 3-wk treatment periods in a randomized, crossover trial. Subjects were given muffins that contributed approximately 20 g fiber/d from either flaxseed (approximately 50 g partially defatted flaxseed/d) or wheat bran (control) while they consumed self-selected National Cholesterol Education Program Step II diets. Both muffins had similar macronutrient profiles. Treatment phases were separated by > or = 2 wk.

The present study was performed to investigate whether consumption of a tomato oleoresin extract for 2 weeks can affect endogenous levels of DNA single strand breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes in healthy non-smokers and smokers. We also assessed, the effect of the tomato oleoresin extract on various immunological functions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study design was used. Over a period of 2 weeks 15 non-smokers and 12 smokers were given three tomato oleoresin extract capsules daily (each containing 4.88 mg lycopene, 0.48 mg phytoene, 0.44 mg phytofluene and 1.181 mg alpha-tocopherol). The control group received placebos. The baseline level of endogenous DNA damage for non-smokers was slightly (13%) and non-significantly (P = 0.44) lower than that of smokers. Placebo supplementation of non-smokers and smokers for 2 weeks did not significantly affect lycopene plasma levels or DNA damage in either group. Intervention with tomato oleoresin extract resulted in significant increases in total plasma lycopene and resulted in decreased levels of DNA strand breaks of approximately 32 (non-smokers) and 39% (smokers). However, this effect was not statistically significant in either group (P = 0.09 for non-smokers and P = 0.12 for smokers). Analysis of the distribution pattern of DNA strand breaks showed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of comets in class 0 (undamaged) and a decrease in classes 1 and 2 (damaged) after the tomato oleoresin extract intervention in non-smokers. The changes in the smoker group were not statistically significant. Treatment with the tomato extract had no effect on lymphocyte proliferation, NK cell activity, interleukin (IL)-2 production and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha production, but it significantly reduced IL-4 production in smokers (P = 0.009).

222,72682,Phase IIa chemoprevention trial of green tea polyphenols in high-risk individuals of liver cancer: modulation of urinary excretion of green tea polyphenols and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine.,Carcinogenesis,15930028,"Modulation of urinary excretion of green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and oxidative DNA damage biomarker, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), were assessed in urine samples collected from a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled phase IIa chemoprevention trial with GTP in 124 individuals. These individuals were sero-positive for both HBsAg and aflatoxin-albumin adducts, and took GTP capsules daily at doses of 500 mg, 1000 mg or a placebo for 3 months. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected before the intervention and at the first and third month of the study. Urinary excretion of 8-OHdG and GTP components was measured by HPLC-CoulArray electrochemical detection. The baseline levels of 8-OHdG and GTP components among the three groups showed homogeneity (P > 0.70), and a non-significant fluctuation was observed in the placebo group over the 3 months (P > 0.30). In GTP-treated groups, epigallocatechin (EGC) and epicatechin (EC) levels displayed significant and dose-dependent increases in both the 500 mg group and 1000 mg group (P < 0.05). The 8-OHdG levels did not differ between the three groups at the 1 month collection, with medians of 1.83, 2.08 and 1.86 ng/mg-creatinine for placebo, 500 and 1000 mg group, respectively (P = 0.999). At the end of the 3 months' intervention, 8-OHdG levels decreased significantly in both GTP-treated groups, with medians of 2.02, 1.03 and 1.15 ng/mg-creatinine for placebo, 500 mg and 1000 mg group, respectively (P = 0.007). These results suggest that urinary excretions of EGC and EC can serve as practical biomarkers for green tea consumption in human populations. The results also suggest that chemoprevention with GTP is effective in diminishing oxidative DNA damage.

223,72693,Impact of multiple genetic polymorphisms on effects of a 4-week blueberry juice intervention on ex vivo induced lymphocytic DNA damage in human volunteers.,Carcinogenesis,17602170,"Consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with a decrease in cancer incidence and cardiovascular disease, presumably caused by antioxidants. We designed a human intervention study to assess antioxidative and possible anti-genotoxic properties of fruit-borne antioxidants. We hypothesized that individuals bearing genetic polymorphisms for genes related to quercetin metabolism, benzo[a]pyrene metabolism, oxidative stress and DNA repair differ in their response to DNA protective effects of increased antioxidant intake. In the present study, 168 healthy volunteers consumed a blueberry/apple juice that provided 97 mg quercetin and 16 mg ascorbic acid a day. After a 4-week intervention period, plasma concentrations of quercetin and ascorbic acid and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) were significantly increased. Further, we found 20% protection (P < 0.01) against ex vivo H(2)O(2)-provoked oxidative DNA damage, measured by comet assay. However, the level of ex vivo induced benzo[a]pyrene-diol-epoxide (BPDE)-DNA adducts was 28% increased upon intervention (P < 0.01). Statistical analysis of 34 biologically relevant genetic polymorphisms revealed that six significantly influenced the outcome of the intervention. Lymphocytes from individuals bearing variant genotype for Cyp1B1 5 seemed to benefit more than wild-types from DNA damage-protecting effects upon intervention. Variants for COMT tended to benefit less or even experienced detrimental effects from intervention. With respect to GSTT1, the effect is ambiguous; variants respond better in terms of intervention-related increase in TEAC, but wild-types benefit more from its protecting effects against oxidative DNA damage. We conclude that genotyping for relevant polymorphisms enables selecting subgroups among the general population that benefit more of DNA damage-modulating effects of micronutrients. 7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxide Adolescent Adult Antioxidants Blueberry Plants DNA Adducts DNA Damage Female Fruit Humans Lymphocytes Male Malus Middle Aged Pilot Projects Plant Preparations Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",1

Geriatric assessment has been suggested as a possibly useful approach in dealing with frail elderly cancer patients. This was a secondary subset analysis from a randomized 2 x 2 factorial trial in 11 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. Hospitalized, frail patients at least 65 years old, after stabilization of their acute illness, were randomized to receive care in a geriatric inpatient unit, a geriatric outpatient clinic, both, or neither. The interventions involved core teams that provided geriatric assessment and patient management. We identified 99 patients with a diagnosis of cancer by The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes, excluding all nonmelanoma skin cancers. Outcomes collected at discharge, 6 months, and 1 year after randomization were survival, changes in health-related quality of life (using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form general health survey [SF-36]), activities of daily living, physical performance, health service utilization, and costs. There was no effect on mortality (1-year survival 59.6%). The changes in the SF-36 scores from randomization for emotional limitation, mental health and bodily pain (also sustained at 1 year) on the SF-36 were better for geriatric inpatient care cancer patients at discharge.

226,74367,Aged garlic extract has potential suppressive effect on colorectal adenomas in humans.,The Journal of nutrition,16484573,"Epidemiological and animal studies suggest AGE and its organosulfur constituents, such as S-allylcysteine and S-allylmercaptocysteine have anticarcinogenic effects. To confirm these effects in humans, a preliminary double-blind, randomized clinical trial using high-dose AGE (AGE 2.4 mL/d) as an active treatment and low-dose AGE (AGE 0.16 mL/d) as a control was performed on patients with colorectal adenomas-precancerous lesions of the large bowel. The study enrolled 51 patients who were diagnosed as carrying colorectal adenomas. The patients were randomly assigned to the two groups after adenomas larger than 5 mm in diameter were removed by polypectomy. The number and size of adenomas right before intake (0 mo) and at 6 and 12 mo after intake were measured using colonoscopy. Thirty-seven patients (19 in the active group, 18 in the control group) completed the study and were evaluated for the efficacy of AGE. The number of adenomas increased linearly in the control group from the beginning (the baseline), but AGE significantly suppressed both the size and number of colon adenomas in patients after 12 mo of high-dose treatment (P=0.04). The results suggest AGE suppresses progression of colorectal adenomas in humans. It appears that AGE has multiple pathways to reduce cancer incidence and suppress its growth and proliferation.

Cancer was the leading cause of death, with 32% of all deaths due to esophageal or stomach cancer, followed by cerebrovascular disease (25%). Significantly (P = .03) lower total mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.99) occurred among those receiving supplementation with beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium. The reduction was mainly due to lower cancer rates (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.75-1.00), especially stomach cancer (RR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.64-0.99), with the reduced risk beginning to arise about 1-2 years after the start of supplementation with these vitamins and minerals. No significant effects on mortality rates from all causes were found for supplementation with retinol and zinc, riboflavin and niacin, or vitamin C and molybdenum. Patterns of cancer incidence, on the basis of 1298 cases, generally resembled those for cancer mortality. We sought to determine if dietary supplementation with specific vitamins and minerals can lower mortality from or incidence of cancer as well as mortality from other diseases in Linxian. Individuals of ages 40-69 were recruited in 1985 from four Linxian communes. Mortality and cancer incidence during March 1986-May 1991 were ascertained for 29,584 adults who received daily vitamin and mineral supplementation throughout this period. The subjects were randomly assigned to intervention groups according to a one-half replicate of a 2(4) factorial experimental design. This design enabled testing for the effects of four combinations of nutrients: (A) retinol and zinc; (B) riboflavin and niacin; (C) vitamin C and molybdenum; and (D) beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium.

No substantial short-term beneficial effect on incidence or mortality for this type of cancer occurred following daily supplementation with multiple vitamins and minerals among adults with precancerous lesions of the esophagus. A total of 324 deaths occurred during the 6-year intervention period; 167 occurred in the control (placebo) group and 157 occurred in the supplement group. Cancer was the leading cause of death (54% of all deaths); 18% were due to cerebrovascular diseases and 29% to other causes. Cumulative esophageal/gastric cardia death rates were 8% lower (relative risk [RR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67-1.28) among individuals receiving supplements rather than placebo, a nonsignificant (P > .10) difference. Risk of total mortality was 7% lower (RR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.75-1.16; P > .10), total cancer 4% lower (RR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.71-1.29; P > .10), cerebrovascular disease 38% lower (RR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.37-1.06; P = .08), and other diseases 12% higher (RR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.74-1.69; P > .10) among the treated group. Cumulative cancer incidence rates were nearly the same in the two groups. Mortality and cancer incidence were ascertained from May 1985 through May 1991 for 3318 persons with cytologic evidence of esophageal dysplasia who were randomly assigned to receive, throughout that period, daily supplementation with 14 vitamins and 12 minerals or placebo. Doses were typically two to three times U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances. Compliance was assessed by counting unused pills monthly for all trial participants and by assaying nutrient levels in blood collected from samples of individuals randomly selected without replacement every 3 months throughout the trial. Cancers were identified through routine surveillance and by special cytology and endoscopy screenings after 2 1/2 years and 6 years. To determine whether supplementation with multiple vitamins and minerals may reduce esophageal/gastric cardia cancer among persons with esophageal dysplasia, we conducted a 6-year prospective intervention trial in Linxian.

229,74586,Enhancing adherence following abnormal Pap smears among low-income minority women: a preventive telephone counseling strategy.,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,9168185,"Although the incidence of precancerous conditions of the cervix has recently been increasing, prompt initial and long-term follow-up care can effectively reduce unnecessary morbidity and mortality. For example, the 4-year survival rates among those individuals at greatest risk for cervical cancer (i.e., minority women of low socioeconomic status) approach 95% with early detection. Women who present with advanced disease have a much poorer outlook (0%-39% survival). Yet, high-risk individuals are least likely to adhere to recommended diagnostic regimens. We tested the effectiveness of a brief telephone counseling intervention directed to low-income, inner-city women after they had received an abnormal Pap smear result. The women were counseled on the importance of having an initial and 6-month repeat follow-up diagnostic procedure (i.e., colposcopic examination of the cervix). A randomized trial design was used to compare the effects on these women of telephone counseling with (n = 192) or without (n = 203) a booster counseling telephone call prior to the appointment for a repeat colposcopy 6 months later, with a telephone appointment confirmation/reminder call (n = 216) and with standard care (i.e., no telephone contact) (n = 217). The telephone counseling protocol probed for and addressed three psychologic barriers to adherence (i.e., attendance at appointment for colposcopy examination): 1) encoding/expectancy (e.g., did the patient understand her risk of developing cervical cancer?); 2) affective/emotional (e.g., was the woman worried about the condition and its consequences?); and 3) self-regulatory/practical (e.g., was the woman likely to forget medical appointments?). Logistic regression was used to analyze the effects of the intervention group and the type of psychologic barriers elicited on colposcopy adherence. The results of logistic regression analysis (using those who received an appointment confirmation/reminder telephone call as the comparison group) revealed that telephone counseling produced significantly higher adherence rates to the initial colposcopy visit compared with telephone confirmation (300 [76%] of 395 women versus 147 [68%] of 216; odds ratio [OR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-2.17). Additionally, standard care resulted in significantly lower adherence rates than did telephone confirmation (109 [50%] of 217 women versus 147 [68%] of 216; OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.32-0.73). Regarding attendance at the 6-month repeat colposcopy appointments, the 80 patients who had received telephone counseling prior to the initial visit (and were recommended for follow-up colposcopy) were significantly more likely to adhere than were the 47 patients who had received telephone confirmation (49 [61%] of 80 women versus 17 [36.2%] of 47; OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.15-6.51). The 6-month adherence rates for patients in the telephone confirmation group and the standard care group (n = 30) were low and did not differ significantly (17 [36.2%] of 47 women versus nine [30.0%] of 30; OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.40-2.89). Forgetting medical appointments (OR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.19-0.51) and having scheduling conflicts (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.28-0.72) were also associated with lower rates of adherence. The use of telephone counseling appears to be an effective strategy for enhancing initial and long-term adherence to a follow-up cervical diagnostic procedure in a traditionally underserved population. Patients who respond to a positive Pap test result with a particular profile of psychologic barriers may require more intensive and targeted counseling interventions.

230,75220,Higher Plasma Selenium Concentrations Are Associated with Increased Odds of Prevalent Type 2 Diabetes.,The Journal of nutrition,29924331,"We examined the association between baseline plasma concentrations of selenium and the prevalence of T2D, as well as whether participant characteristics or intake of other antioxidant nutrients modified this relation. These findings show that higher plasma concentrations of selenium were significantly associated with prevalent T2D among participants in a selenium supplementation trial. Future work is needed to elucidate whether there are individual characteristics, such as blood concentrations of other antioxidants, which may influence this relation. Mean ± SD plasma selenium concentrations for those with T2D compared with those without T2D were 143.6 ± 28.9 and 138.7 ± 27.2 ng/mL, respectively. After adjustment for confounding, higher plasma selenium concentrations were associated with a higher prevalence of T2D, with ORs (95% CIs) of 1.25 (0.80, 1.95) and 1.77 (1.16, 2.71) for the second and third tertiles of plasma selenium, respectively, compared with the lowest tertile (P-trend = 0.007). No significant effect modification was observed for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, or ethnicity. Increased odds of T2D were seen among those who were in the highest tertile of plasma selenium and the highest category of intake of β-cryptoxanthin (P-trend = 0.03) and lycopene (P-trend = 0.008); however, interaction terms were not significant. We conducted cross-sectional analyses of 1727 participants from the Selenium Trial, a randomized clinical trial of selenium supplementation for colorectal adenoma chemoprevention that had data for baseline selenium plasma concentrations, T2D status, and dietary intake. Logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the associations between plasma selenium concentrations and prevalent T2D, adjusting for confounding factors. Heterogeneity of effect by participant characteristics was evaluated utilizing likelihood-ratio tests. Selenium, an essential trace element, has been investigated as a potential cancer prevention agent. However, several studies have indicated that selenium supplementation may be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although an equivocal relation of this nature requires confirmation.

To evaluate the relationship between pain sensitivity and children's distress during lumbar punctures (LPs), and whether pain sensitivity functions as a moderator of children's responses to a psychological intervention aimed at reducing LP distress. Fifty-five children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ages 3 to 18) and their parents completed a questionnaire measure of pain sensitivity. Self-report, physiological, and observed measures of distress were collected during the study baseline LP. Children were then randomized into a psychological intervention or an attention control group. Postintervention and follow-up LPs were observed. Higher levels of pain sensitivity were associated with greater anxiety and pain, both prior to and during the LP. Preliminary analyses indicated that pain sensitivity moderated the effects of intervention on distress. Children who were more pain-sensitive and who received no intervention showed greater increases in LP distress over time. In contrast, children who were more pain-sensitive and who received intervention showed greater decreases in LP distress over time.

232,75239,Feasibility and preliminary outcomes from a pilot study of a brief psychological intervention for families of children newly diagnosed with cancer.,Journal of pediatric psychology,16260434,"SCCIP-ND appears to be an acceptable intervention that can be used successfully with caregivers over the first few months after diagnosis. Recruitment and retention data document feasibility but also highlight challenges. Preliminary outcome data show changes in the desired direction [e.g., reduced anxiety and parental posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)]. The pilot data are supportive of the value and challenges of developing evidence-based family interventions in pediatric psychology. To report initial feasibility and outcome from a pilot study of a new three-session intervention for caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer, Surviving Cancer Competently Intervention Program-Newly Diagnosed (SCCIP-ND). Nineteen families (38 caregivers) were randomly assigned to SCCIP-ND or treatment as usual subsequent to learning of their child's illness. The study design included pre- and 2-month postintervention assessments, with state anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms as outcomes.

233,76062,Patient participation in the cancer consultation: evaluation of a question prompt sheet.,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,8186168,"A question prompt sheet has a limited but important effect on patient question asking behaviour in the cancer consultation. Active participation and asking questions are important ways in which patients can ensure they understand what the doctor has said. This study evaluated a question prompt sheet designed to encourage patients to ask questions in the cancer consultation. Patients (n = 142) were randomised to receive (i) a question prompt sheet or (ii) a general sheet informing patients of services available through the regional Cancer Council. Recall of information was assessed in a structured interview 4-20 days after the consultation. Questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction and adjustment to cancer were sent by mail. The question prompt sheet had a significant effect in one content area: prognosis. Thirty-five percent of patients who received the question handout asked questions about prognosis compared to 16% of those receiving the information handout. The prompt sheet did not increase the mean number of questions asked overall. Age, in/out-patient status, gender and involvement preference were predictive of both number and duration of patient questions.

234,76364,A 4-year randomized trial comparing three outreach interventions to promote screening mammograms.,Translational behavioral medicine,29796649,"As population health has become a focus of health care payers and providers, interest has grown in mail, phone, and other forms of outreach for improving population rates of cancer screening. Translational research is needed to compare the effectiveness and cost of low- and high-intensity behavioral outreach interventions for promoting cancer screening. The purpose of the article is to compare the effectiveness in promoting biannual mammograms of three interventions delivered over 4 years to a primary care population with a high baseline mammography adherence of 83.3%. We randomized women aged 40-84 to reminder letter only (LO arm), letter + reminder call (RC arm), and two letters + counseling call (CC arm) involving tailored education and motivational interviewing. Mammography adherence (≥1 mammogram in the previous 24 months) at four time points was determined from insurance claims records. Over 4 years, 30,162 women were randomized. At the end of 4 years, adherence was highest in the RC arm (83.0%) compared with CC (80.8%) and LO (80.8%) arms (p = .03). Only 23.5% of women in the CC arm were reached and accepted full counseling. The incremental cost per additional mammogram for RC arm women was $30.45 over the LO arm cost. A simple reminder call can increase screening mammogram adherence even when baseline adherence is high. Some more complex behavioral interventions delivered by mail and phone as in this study may be less effective, due to limited participation of patients, a focus on ambivalence, lack of follow-up, and other factors.

235,76421,Comparison of the fecal microflora of Seventh-Day Adventists with individuals consuming a general diet. Implications concerning colonic carcinoma.,Annals of surgery,327955,"Qualitative and quantitative fecal microflora was studied in a double blind fashion in 28 subjects. Fourteen were Seventh-Day Adventists, who were strict vegetarians, while the remaining 14 subjects were individuals consuming a general western diet. No statistically significant differences were identified in the fecal microflora of the two groups. The bacteriologic analysis included total aerobes and total anaerobes as well as each of the major fecal aerobes and anaerobes. This study seems to indicate that the dietary intake of animal fat and protein does not significantly alter the fecal microflora, a possibility which has previously been suggested as being part of the explanation for the higher incidence of colonic carcinoma in those who consume meat compared with vegetarians. It does not, however, invalidate the concept that dietary animal fat does increase bile acid degradation within the gastrointestinal tract, a factor which has been related to colon cancer. Future studies should be directed at identifying the factors that may be present in the gastrointestinal tracts of vegetarians which modify the ability of their colonic microflora to degrade bile acids, an essential step in the production of intraluminal carcinogens or co-carcinogens.

236,76896,Mammographic densities in a one-year isoflavone intervention.,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),12671541,"The estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects of isoflavones, phytoestrogens contained in soy foods, have been proposed as mechanisms for the possible involvement of soy products in the development of breast cancer. We investigated the hypothesis that isoflavones reduce mammographic density, a predictor of breast cancer risk. We conducted a double-blind randomized trial in premenopausal women who received a daily 100 mg isoflavone supplement or a placebo over 12 months. Compliance with the study regimen was confirmed by urinary isoflavones and tablet counts. We used a computer-assisted method to measure mammographic density and paired t-tests to assess changes in mammographic characteristics from baseline to follow-up mammogram. Complete sets of mammograms were available for 30 women. The two groups differed by age and mammographic density at baseline, but were similar in body weight and nutritional intakes. We detected no significant changes either in the size of the dense areas or in the per cent densities. A non-significant decrease in breast area among intervention group subjects was probably the result of methodological issues in comparing mammograms taken under different conditions. In conclusion, our findings do not support the hypothesis that isoflavones decrease mammographic density during a one-year intervention. Although this exploratory study had limited power, it appears that isoflavones do not exert an estrogenic effect similar to hormone replacement therapy on mammographic density.

237,77213,Intensive lifestyle changes may affect the progression of prostate cancer.,The Journal of urology,16094059,"Men with prostate cancer are often advised to make changes in diet and lifestyle, although the impact of these changes has not been well documented. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of comprehensive lifestyle changes on prostate specific antigen (PSA), treatment trends and serum stimulated LNCaP cell growth in men with early, biopsy proven prostate cancer after 1 year. None of the experimental group patients but 6 control patients underwent conventional treatment due to an increase in PSA and/or progression of disease on magnetic resonance imaging. PSA decreased 4% in the experimental group but increased 6% in the control group (p = 0.016). The growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia) was inhibited almost 8 times more by serum from the experimental than from the control group (70% vs 9%, p <0.001). Changes in serum PSA and also in LNCaP cell growth were significantly associated with the degree of change in diet and lifestyle. Patient recruitment was limited to men who had chosen not to undergo any conventional treatment, which provided an unusual opportunity to have a nonintervention randomized control group to avoid the confounding effects of interventions such as radiation, surgery or androgen deprivation therapy. A total of 93 volunteers with serum PSA 4 to 10 ng/ml and cancer Gleason scores less than 7 were randomly assigned to an experimental group that was asked to make comprehensive lifestyle changes or to a usual care control group. Intensive lifestyle changes may affect the progression of early, low grade prostate cancer in men. Further studies and longer term followup are warranted.

Consecutive primary breast cancer patients about to start adjuvant therapy (n = 179) were included. Data were supplied by the questionnaires European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Study Group Core Quality of life questionnaire with 30 questions (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Breast Cancer Module with 23 questions (BR23), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Impact of Event Scale before randomization and 1, 3, and 6 months later. Patient files provided data on utilization of psychosocial support offered in routine care. Global quality of life/health status, nausea and vomiting, and systemic therapy side effects were the subscales showing significant Group by Time interactions, favoring the interventions. Intervention groups improved statistically significantly more than the standard care group regarding insomnia, dyspnea, and financial difficulties. Nurse patients experienced less intrusion compared with the standard care group. All groups showed statistically and clinically significant improvements with time on several subscales. The intervention groups, however, improved to a greater extent. Fewer patients in the intervention groups used psychosocial hospital support compared with the standard care group. In conclusion, psychosocial support by specially trained nurses using techniques derived from cognitive behavioral therapy is beneficial for breast cancer patients and may be a realistic alternative in routine cancer care.

239,77334,A brief intervention for fatigue management in breast cancer survivors.,Cancer nursing,18490891,"The purpose of this randomized control trial was to verify the effectiveness of a brief group intervention that combines stress management psycho-education and physical activity (ie, independent variable) intervention in reducing fatigue and improving energy level, quality of life (mental and physical), fitness (VO 2submax), and emotional distress (ie, dependent variables) in breast cancer survivors. This study applied Lazarus and Folkman stress-coping theoretical framework, as well as Salmon's unifying theory of physical activity. Eighty-seven French-speaking women who had completed their treatments for nonmetastatic breast cancer at a university hospital in Quebec City, Canada, were randomly assigned to either the group intervention (experimental) or the usual-care (control) condition. Data were collected at baseline, postintervention, and at 3-month follow-up. The 4-week group intervention was cofacilitated by 2 nurses. Results showed that participants in the intervention group showed greater improvement in fatigue, energy level, and emotional distress at 3-month follow-up, and physical quality of life at postintervention, compared with the participants in the control group. These results suggest that a brief psycho-educational group intervention focusing on active coping strategies and physical activity is beneficial to cancer survivors after breast cancer treatments.

240,77533,Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy and Persistent Pain in Women Treated for Primary Breast Cancer: Exploring Possible Statistical Mediators: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial.,The Clinical journal of pain,28481837,"Statistically significant indirect effects were found for mindfulness nonreactivity (B=-0.17, BSCI [-0.32 to -0.04]) and pain catastrophizing (B=-0.76, BSCI [-1.25 to -0.47]). No statistically significant indirect effect was found for self-compassion (B=-0.09, BSCI [-0.30 to 0.04]). In a multiple mediator model, including mindfulness nonreactivity and pain catastrophizing, only pain catastrophizing remained statistically significant (B=-0.72, BSCI [-1.19 to -0.33]), explaining 78% of the effect. The results of the present study may have clinical implications. An increased focus on the proposed mediators may optimize the clinical use of MBCT for persistent pain in women treated for breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate possible statistical mediators in a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on pain intensity in women treated for primary breast cancer. The sample consisted of 129 women treated for breast cancer, presenting with persistent pain, who were randomly assigned to MBCT or a wait-list control. We previously reported a statistically significant and robust effect of MBCT on pain intensity (11-point numeric rating scale), which was included as the primary outcome. The proposed mediators were mindfulness (the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), self-compassion (the Short-Form Self-Compassion Scale), and pain catastrophizing (the Pain Catastrophizing Scale). Measurement points included baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 3- (T3) and 6-month (T4) follow-ups. All indirect effects of the mediators were tested in separate Multilevel Models, using the product-of-coefficients approach with bias-corrected confidence intervals (95% BSCI).

241,78082,Body mass index and prostate cancer risk in the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial.,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),29521683,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association between BMI (kg/m) and prostate cancer risk. BMI is a modifiable lifestyle factor and may provide a unique opportunity for primary prevention of prostate cancer if a causal association exists. Data from 11 886 men from the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET, 1985-1996 with active follow-up through 2005) comprising current and former heavy smokers were analyzed. CARET was a multicenter randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial testing daily supplementation of 30 mg β-carotene+25 000 IU retinyl palmitate for primary prevention of lung cancer. Prostate cancer was a secondary outcome. Nonaggressive disease was defined as Gleason less than 7 and stage I/II. Aggressive disease was primarily defined as at least Gleason 7 or stage III/IV, and secondarily by excluding Gleason 3+4 from the first definition. BMI was calculated from measured weight and height. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer incidence between BMI categories. During follow-up, 883 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. In the analysis of aggressive disease when Gleason 3+4 was excluded, men with a BMI of at least 35 kg/m had an increased rate of prostate cancer (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.04-3.11, Ptrend=0.04) compared with men with BMI 18-24.9 kg/m. No other differences were seen in risk estimates for overall, nonaggressive or aggressive prostate cancer including all Gleason 7 cases, between BMI categories. Our results show an association between having a BMI of at least 35 kg/m and an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer (not including Gleason 3+4 tumors), but do not support an association between BMI and risk of overall, aggressive disease including all Gleason 7, or nonaggressive prostate cancer within a population of current and former heavy smokers.

A Randomized Trial.,Diseases of the colon and rectum,30489324,"This is a randomized controlled trial. One hundred patients with an ileostomy were randomly assigned. The most common indications were rectal cancer (n = 26) and ulcerative colitis (n = 21), and 12 were emergency procedures. Although intervention patients had better postdischarge phone follow-up (90% vs 72%; p = 0.025) and were more likely to receive outpatient intravenous fluids (25% vs 6%; p = 0.008), they had similar overall hospital readmissions (20.4% vs 19.6%; p = 1.0), readmissions for dehydration (8.2% vs 5.9%; p = 0.71), and acute renal failure events (10.2% vs 3.9%; p = 0.26). Multivariable analysis found that weekend discharges to home were significantly associated with readmission (OR, 4.5 (95% CI, 1.2-16.9); p = 0.03). Direct costs and patient satisfaction were similar. Patients undergoing elective or nonelective ileostomy as part of their operative procedure were selected. This study was conducted in 3 hospitals within a single health care system. Hospital readmission is common after ileostomy formation and frequently associated with dehydration. A surveillance strategy to ensure compliance with an ileostomy education program tracked patients more closely and was cost neutral, but did not result in decreased hospital readmissions compared with usual care. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A812. This study was limited by the heterogeneous patient population and by the potential effect of the intervention on providers taking care of patients randomly assigned to usual care. Unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge, readmission for dehydration, acute renal failure, estimated direct costs, and patient satisfaction were the primary outcomes measured. Surgeons, advanced practice providers, inpatient and outpatient nurses, and wound ostomy continence nurses participated in a robust ileostomy education and monitoring program (Education Program for Prevention of Ileostomy Complications) based on the published intervention. After informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to a postoperative compliance surveillance and prompting strategy that was directed toward the care team, versus usual care.

Participants in both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Adequate bowel preparation was achieved in 89.1% vs 95.7% in clear-liquid diet and low-fiber diet groups, showing not only noninferiority, but also superiority (p = 0.04). Low-fiber diet participants reported less fluid-intake perception (p = 0.04) and less hunger (p = 0.006), with no differences in bloating or nausea. The single-center design of the study could limit the external validity of the results. The present findings may not be comparable to other clinical settings. A normocaloric low-fiber diet the day before a screening colonoscopy achieved better results than a clear-liquid diet in terms of adequate colon preparation. Moreover, it also improved the perception of hunger and excessive fluid intake. Registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02401802. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A829. Primary outcome was the adequate bowel preparation rate measured with the Boston bowel preparation scale. Secondary outcomes included tolerability, fluid-intake perception, hunger, side effects, and acceptability. Participants were randomly assigned to a clear-liquid diet or a normocaloric low-fiber diet the day before the colonoscopy. Both groups received 4 L of polyethylene glycol in a split-dose regimen. A total of 276 consecutive participants of the Barcelona colorectal cancer screening program were included. The study was conducted at a tertiary care center. This is a randomized, endoscopist-blinded, noninferiority clinical trial. Clinical guidelines recommend either a clear-liquid diet or a low-fiber diet for colonoscopy preparation. Participants in a screening program are usually motivated healthy individuals in which a good tolerability is important to improve adherence to potential surveillance colonoscopies.

We randomized participants to either usual hospital-based follow-up or specialist nurse-led telephone education, empowerment, and structured needs assessment follow-up. The primary outcomes assessed the feasibility of running a larger trial including patient eligibility, recruitment and retention rates, and outcome measure completion. Secondary outcomes were generic and health-related quality of life and a patient self-report health service use (Client Service Receipt Inventory) data collected at 3 time points (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months). Of the 58 women screened, 44 were eligible (76%) and 24 (55%) were recruited and randomized (12:12 to control and intervention, respectively). One participant was lost to follow-up. Recruited participants had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11.2) years and were approximately 5 months from their initial diagnosis (mean [SD], 159 [58] days). Seventeen (71%) of the participants had an endometrial cancer diagnosis. All outcome measure completion rates exceeded 96%. Although not a core feasibility objective, analyses of outcome measures indicated positive changes in quality of life and well-being within the Optimal Personalised Care After Treatment-Gynaecological group; exploratory cost consequence analysis indicated that the nurse-led intervention had a mean total service use cost of £27 per patient (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval, -£290 to £240) lower than did the standard care group.

245,79317,Effects of a Psychoeducational Intervention in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy.,The journal of nursing research : JNR,29360672,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with breast cancer (N = 40) were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group participated in PEI, a brief and highly structured program consisting of two parts: (a) an educational manual that addressed depression, anxiety, disease-specific care knowledge, self-efficacy, and resilience and (b) a self-assessment of learning. The control group received only traditional pamphlet education. Data were collected at four time points: before the first chemotherapy session (T1), during the third chemotherapy session (T2), during the fifth chemotherapy session (T3), and at 2 weeks after the final chemotherapy session (T4). Face-to-face PEI for patients with breast cancer is potentially effective in improving knowledge, resilience, and quality of life during and after chemotherapy. In the current study, PEI significantly improved disease care techniques, reduced chemotherapy-related discomfort, and improved quality of life for participants in the experimental group. Compelling evidence has yet to be published regarding the positive effect of psychoeducational interventions (PEIs) on psychological distress in patients with breast cancer. The impact of PEIs on self-efficacy, resilience, and quality of life is also unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a PEI on anxiety, depression, disease-specific care knowledge, self-efficacy, resilience and quality of life in patients with breast cancer during and after chemotherapy. The intervention was administered before and during five rounds of chemotherapy treatment. Anxiety, depression, resilience, and quality of life in the experimental group showed significant differences at T4. Significant differences became apparent at T2 for knowledge and at T3 for self-efficacy.

246,79318,Significant Effect of Acupressure in Elevating Blood Stem Cell Factor During Chemotherapy in Patients With Gynecologic Cancer.,The journal of nursing research : JNR,30395021,"At posttest, blood hemoglobin had significantly decreased from (mean ± SD) 11.6 ± 2.2 to 10.8 ±1.6 mg/dl (p = .03) in the control group. However, no significant pretest-posttest difference in hemoglobin concentration (11.4 ± 1.0 vs. 10.9 ± 1.1 mg/dl) was detected in the experimental group. Levels of SCF increased significantly between pretest and posttest in both the control group (from 1196.10 ± 293.17 to 1325.05 ± 253.77 ng/ml; p = .01) and the acupressure group (from 1046.78 ± 469.52 to 1387.06 ± 310.00 ng/ml; p = .007). In addition, a borderline difference (p = .05) in mean pretest-posttest SCF increase was found between the acupressure group (340.28 ± 255.46 ng/ml) and the control group (128.94 ± 250.64 ng/ml). Finally, a significant time-dependent interactive effect was found between acupressure and the increased blood level of SCF at posttest (β = 211.34, p = .02). In total, 28 women with gynecological cancer were randomly assigned either to the experimental group (n = 10) or to the control group (n = 18). The experimental group received acupressure of 5-minute duration to the Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Xuehai (SP10), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Taixi (K3), Zusanli (ST36), Taichong (LR3), and Baihui (GV20) points, respectively, three times per day for 6 weeks. The control group did not receive the acupressure intervention. The blood count, including white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin, and serum levels for SCF and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were assessed before (pretest) and 6 weeks after (posttest) the participants' first course of chemotherapy. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of noninvasive acupressure in preventing and diminishing chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in patients with gynecologic cancer and to determine whether this effect is associated with the regulation of the expressions of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor (SCF). Chemotherapy is used mainly to treat and control the progression of gynecological cancer. Bone marrow suppression, one of the adverse side effects of chemotherapy, may decrease immune function, increasing the risk of serious, fatal infections. The findings support that acupressure on specific acupoints increases blood SCF levels significantly, which may help protect chemotherapy patients from experiencing reduced hemoglobin levels and may relieve chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in patients with gynecologic cancer. This noninvasive approach is suggested for practical implementation in patients undergoing a course of chemotherapy.

248,80918,Oral glutamine supplements reduce concurrent chemoradiotherapy-induced esophagitis in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,Medicine,30813149,"From September 2014 to September 2015, 60 patients diagnosed with NSCLC were included to the study. Thirty patients (50%) received prophylactic powdered GLN orally at a dose of 10 g/8 h. The prescribed radiation dose to the planning target volume was 30 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. The endpoints were radiation-induced esophagitis, mucositis, body weight loss, overall survival and progression-free survival. Complications related to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) such as acute radiation-induced esophagitis (ARIE) may cause significant morbidity and unplanned treatment delays in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We designed a prospective randomized study to assess the impact of glutamine (GLN) supplementation in preventing CCRT-induced toxicities of advanced NSCLC patients. Our study suggests a beneficial effect of oral glutamine supplementation for the prevention from radiation-induced injury and body weight loss in advanced NSCLC patients who receiving CCRT. The 60 patients with NSCLC included 42 men and 18 women with a mean age ± standard deviation of 60.3 years ± 18.2 (range, 44-78 years).At a median follow-up of 26.4 months (range 10.4-32.2), all patients tolerated GLN well. A administration of GLN was associated with a decrease in the incidence of grade 2 or 3 ARIE (6.7% vs 53.4% for Gln+ vs Gln-; P = .004). GLN supplementation appeared to significantly delay ARIE onset for 5.8 days (18.2 days vs 12.4 days; P = .027) and reduced incidence of weight loss (20% vs 73.3%; P = .01).

249,80934,Responses of lung cancer survivors undergoing gamma knife surgery to supportive group psychotherapy.,Medicine,30817604,"An increasingly important concern for clinicians who care for patients with cancers is their psychological problems and quality of life. The present study examined the efficacy of supportive group psychotherapy (SGP) on anxiety, depression and overall quality of life in patients with lung cancer undergoing gamma knife surgery (GKS).160 patients with lung cancer undergoing GKS were randomly divided into SGP group (n = 82) and care as usual (CAU) group (n = 78). Patients in SGP group received 90 minutes' group psychotherapy intervention once a week for 8 weeks, while patients in CAU group received usual care. Outcome measures were administered before and after the intervention and at 3-months follow-up. The primary outcome measures were the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the secondary outcome measures were the 30-item European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30).Demographic characteristics between SGP and CAU groups showed no difference in sex, age, course of disease, years of education, marital status and profession. Psychological characteristics evaluated by HADS revealed that levels of both depression and anxiety in SGP group were significantly improved compared with that in CAU group at the end of the treatment and the improvement remained at the 3-months follow-up. In addition, EORTC QLQ-C30 demonstrated that functional scales including emotion, cognition and society in SGP group were significantly higher than that in CAU group at the end of the treatment and maintained till 3-months follow-up. EORTC QLQ-C30 also showed that symptom scales including fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, syspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite and financial problems in the former group were significantly lower than that in the latter group and maintained till 3-months follow-up. Furthermore, compared with that in SGP group before treatment, these variables in both HADS and EORTC QLQ-C30 showed obvious improvement in the same group after treatment and at the 3-months follow-up.The results suggested that SGP can alleviate anxiety and depression in patients with lung cancer following GKS and improve the overall quality of life.

251,81059,Effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on psychological adjustment in Chinese pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: A randomized trial.,Medicine,31277176,"Prior to the intervention, the ability of psychological adjustment between 2 groups showed no significant difference (P > .05 for all). After intervention, the total CD-RISC score was significantly higher (56.09 ± 7.29 vs 44.75 ± 5.40), whereas the scores of depression (4.57 ± 2.94 vs 7.25 ± 4.25), anxiety (5.83 ± 3.07 vs 8.66 ± 4.92), stress (7.51 ± 4.33 vs 11.17 ± 4.25) were obviously lower in CBT group than those in the control group (P < .05 for all). Moreover, the decline of negative mood score in Yolk sac tumor children was the most evident in CBT group. While the resilience changes of cancer children in stage III was most obvious. CBT can effectively help Chinese pediatric cancer patients modify distorted cognition to have a positive attitude towards cancer and chemotherapy. This treatment enhances resilience and relieves negative mood, which results in good psychological adjustment ability, especially in Yolk sac tumor and stage III. It has a beneficial effect on better treatment cooperation and high long-term quality of life. One hundred four Chinese pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were divided into CBT group and control group randomly and equally. The resilience and negative mood were applied to evaluate the ability of psychological adjustment (PA). The Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and depression anxiety stress scale (DASS) were employed to measure resilience and negative mood before and after intervention. The SPSS 22.0 software was used to analyze data. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely used in pediatric cancer patients to promote psychological adjustment (PA). Considering the diversity of region and culture in China, its effect in Chinese population is not well defined. Therefore, our study is to explore the effect of CBT on improving PA in Chinese pediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of high-proportion medium chain triglyceride (MCT) on body fat distribution and levels of leptin and adiponectin during chemotherapy of children with ALL.New-onset ALL children treated at the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center between March 2016 and March 2017 were enrolled. Children were divided into the MCT and control groups. For the MCT group, high-proportion MCT nutrition preparation was added to the diet, while no MCT was added for the control group. The MCT group was further divided into subgroups A and B based on the amount of supplement. Waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, bone marrow concentrations of leptin and adiponectin, and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio were measured before and on days 19 and 46 of chemotherapy. Body weight and body mass index (BMI) were measured on admission and discharge.Waist circumference in the control group increased by day 46 (P = .047), but did not change in the MCT group. The BMI of the children in the control group was higher than those in the MCT group on admission (P = .003), but not different at discharge. No significant differences in hip circumference, leptin levels, adiponectin levels, and body weight were observed between the 2 groups.This preliminary study suggests that short-term supplementation of high-proportion MCT nutrition preparation may help reduce the centripetal distribution of adipose induced by the application of glucocorticoids in children with ALL.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Pancreas,30325865,"Little is known about chromogranin A (CgA) during follow-up of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. We hypothesized that serial CgA monitoring might be useful for the assessment of tumor progression, and we performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis. A bibliographical search was performed in PubMed using ""chromogranin A"" and ""neuroendocrine tumors"" and ""follow-up"" and ""biomarker"" to identify all pertinent articles published in the last 10 years. Eight studies were included in current meta-analysis. Chromogranin A as a follow-up marker shows sensitivity between 46% and 100% and specificity between 68% and 90%. The meta-analysis results showed an overall accuracy of 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81-86.6), a cumulative sensitivity of 74.6% (95% CI, 61.9-85.4), and a cumulative specificity of 84.7% (95% CI, 81.3-87.7). These data indicate that circulating CgA has a better overall accuracy in the follow-up setting; it can be used to rule the diagnosis of recurrence/progression in, rather than to rule it out. Chromogranin A is more reliable when used to monitor disease progression and response to treatment and for the early detection of recurrence after treatment rather than in the diagnostic setting. It is more sensible to use this marker in those cases where the initial values were impaired.

255,81684,Progressive Resistance Training to Impact Physical Fitness and Body Weight in Pancreatic Cancer Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,Pancreas,30589829,"Of 65 patients, 43 patients were analyzed. Adherence rates were 64.1% (RT1) and 78.4% (RT2) of the prescribed training sessions. RT1 showed significant improvements in elbow flexor/extensor muscle strength and in maximal work load versus CON and RT2 (P < 0.05). Further, knee extensors were significantly improved for RT1 versus CON (P < 0.05). Body weight revealed no significant group differences over time. Progressive RT was feasible in PC patients and improved muscle strength with significant results for some muscle groups. Supervised RT seemed to be more effective than home-based RT. Maintaining or improving muscle mass and muscle strength is an important treatment goal in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients because of high risk of cachexia. Therefore, we assessed feasibility and effectivity of a 6-month progressive resistance training (RT) in PC patients within a randomized controlled trial. Sixty-five PC patients were randomly assigned to either supervised progressive RT (RT1), home-based RT (RT2), or usual care control group (CON). Both exercise groups performed training 2 times per week for 6 months.

The aim of this study was to evaluate serum trace elements and vitamins of children with cancer at diagnosis and during treatment. Children with newly diagnosed cancer who were admitted to our center were evaluated for serum selenium, iron, ferritin, C-reactive protein, vitamin B12, folate, and 25-OH vitamin D levels at presentation, and at the third and sixth months of cancer treatment. Forty-two children (male/female: 15/27) with a median age of 8 years (range, 2 to 17) were included in the study. Mean serum B12, folate, and iron levels were within normal ranges, but selenium and 25-OH vitamin D were low at presentation and during the 6-month period. Serum ferritin levels were high in all 3 measures, but they decreased significantly at the sixth month (P=0.04). There was no relation between micronutrient deficiency and sex, or primary disease, or stage, or place of residence of the patient. In conclusion, serum trace element and vitamin deficiencies are common in children with cancer, and there is a need for further studies with larger patient series.

To assess the impact of a decision aid regarding the treatment options for patients with localized prostate cancer. A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was used to compare booklet patient decision aid (intervention group n = 61) with standard information for localized prostate cancer (control group n = 61). The study was conducted at 3 hospitals between 2011 and 2013. The main outcome measures were knowledge, decisional conflict, satisfaction with the decision-making process, and coping. The respective mean Decisional Conflict Scale scores before and after the intervention were 53.0 ± 16.9 and 31.2 ± 10.2 in the intervention group and 49.1 ± 13.7 and 51.7 ± 13.3 in the control group (P < .001). Mean Knowledge scores were 38.6 ± 16.5 and 75.7 ± 19.0 in the intervention group and 42.0 ± 17.6 and 49.9 ± 16.0 in the control group (P < .001). Mean Satisfaction With Decision Scale scores were 81.1 ± 8.92 and 95.7 ± 6.89 in the intervention group and 82.5 ± 12.0 and 79.3 ± 10.3 in the control group (P < .001). Decision aid not only improved patient knowledge about localized prostate cancer and its treatment and their satisfaction with decision making but also decreased their decisional conflict. Decision aid represents a rather innovative approach for a health insurance fund to develop and offer this format of information and decision support. This opens a new field of study for nurses to empower patients in the decision-making process and develop new roles in this area.

Of eligible patients, 76% consented, 42 were randomized, and 69% completed the 6-month assessment. Mean age was 58.2 years; 48% were sexually active. There was no difference in adherence between arms. Overall, 20% and 8.3% were adherent to the prescribed use of 3 times per week, and 64% and 16% were adherent to use at least once per week at 6 weeks and 6 months, respectively. Adherence was greater among those motivated by vaginal health and having lower body mass index. Nonadherence was significantly higher among those who are college educated, in the EEP group, and with higher weight. Nursing education that includes how dilators may maintain vaginal health may improve use because it was a motivator for adherence in this study. Feasibility of recruitment into a study of vaginal dilator use was high. Adherence was low, and there was no difference between groups. Adherence to vaginal dilator use requires novel interventions to test. Vaginal brachytherapy, a common treatment of endometrial cancer, is associated with high rates of vaginal stenosis. Recommendations for vaginal dilator use to minimize stenosis generally include 3 times per week for approximately 10 minutes per use. However, adherence rates range widely and are generally well less than 50%. Eligibility included women treated with postoperative vaginal brachytherapy for stage I to IIIc endometrial cancer.

Breast cancer patients in Hong Kong were randomly allocated to the intervention arm or the control arm. The control arm received routine hospital care. The intervention arm received the nurse-led care plus the routine hospital care. The quality of life, self-efficacy, symptom distress levels, and satisfaction with care were evaluated with questionnaires before randomization (T0), in the middle of chemotherapy (T1), and 1 month after chemotherapy (T2). Individual interviews were conducted with some participants in the intervention arm at T2. The intervention arm participants reported significantly lower distress levels from oral problems, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, distressful feelings, and higher satisfaction with care. According to the satisfaction evaluation and the interviews, the participants stated that the service was helpful in providing information and communication opportunities, filling the service gap after drug administration, providing psychological support, relieving discomfort, and building confidence. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a nurse-led care program for patients receiving outpatient-based chemotherapy. The nurse-led care program could be applied to breast cancer patients in other hospitals in Hong Kong. Exploring its applicability to cancer settings in other countries is recommended. Healthcare providers are facing the challenge of helping cancer patients cope with the impact of outpatient-based chemotherapy. A nurse-led care program was proposed to address this challenge.

One hundred patients with thyroidectomized differentiated thyroid cancer who underwent high-dose I therapy were enrolled in the clinical trial and randomized into 2 groups (PG massage group and nonmassage group). The serum amylase value was obtained before and 24 hours after I therapy, and the SGSs were also taken just before and at 8 months after the I therapy. Change in serum amylase value and SGS was compared between PG massage and nonmassage groups. PG gland massage significantly reduced the incidence rates of salivary gland dysfunction on the 8-month F/U SGS and the level of the serological marker of salivary gland destruction after I therapy. Therefore, PG gland massage could alleviate salivary gland damage related to I therapy. The difference value of serum amylase was significantly lower in PG massage group than in nonmassage group (P = 0.0052). Worsening of PG function on SGS was observed in 43 (45.3%) of the 95 patients. The incidence rate of PG abnormality on F/U SGS was significantly lower in PG massage group than in nonmassage group (odds ratio, 0.3704; P = 0.0195). In the multiple regression analysis, PG massage significantly affected the abnormality on the 8-month F/U SGS (rpartial = -0.2741, P = 0.0090) after adjusting for clinical variables (age, sex, TNM stage, TSH preparation methods for the I therapy, and I dose).

Omega-3 fatty acid and microbial cell preparation (MCP) have been known to provide significant benefits in patients on chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid and MCP in quality of life, chemotherapy side effects and inflammatory markers in colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. A double-blind randomized study was carried out with 140 colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Subjects were separated into two groups to receive either placebo or MCP [30 billion colony-forming unit (CFUs) per sachet] at a dose of two sachets daily for 4 weeks, and omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 2 g daily for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were quality of life, side effects of chemotherapy and levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid improved the overall quality of life and alleviated certain side effects of chemotherapy. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid also managed to reduce the level of IL-6 (P = 0.002).

263,84445,Couple-focused interventions for men with localized prostate cancer and their spouses: A randomized clinical trial.,British journal of health psychology,30852854,"A total of 237 patients and partners were randomly assigned to receive IET, GHW, or UC. Participants completed measures of psychological functioning and relationship satisfaction at baseline, 5 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months post-baseline. Primary outcomes were psychological adjustment, depression, cancer-specific distress, cancer concerns, and relationship satisfaction. Few couple-focused interventions have improved psychological and relationship functioning among men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and their spouses. This study compared the impact of intimacy-enhancing therapy (IET), a general health and wellness intervention (GHW), and usual care (UC) on the psychological and relationship functioning of localized prostate cancer patients and their partners. Relationship length, relationship satisfaction, and patient masculinity were evaluated as moderators. This study was a randomized clinical trial with three study arms and four assessment time points. Intimacy-enhancing therapy did not show an impact on general or cancer-specific distress, but did show an early impact on relationship satisfaction among spouses. IET was superior to UC for patients in longer relationships. It will be important for researchers to understand which couple-focused interventions benefits both patients and spouses and to identify characteristics of patients, partners, and couples who may not benefit from psychological treatments. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer report lower health-related quality of life and both patients and spouses report elevated distress. Relationship communication plays a role in couples' psychological adaptation to prostate cancer. Couple-focused interventions have illustrated an impact on relationship communication. There are no studies comparing different couple-focused interventions. What does this study add? Intimacy-enhancing therapy was not superior to no treatment or a comparison treatment for the broad range of psychological and relationship outcomes. Intimacy-enhancing therapy was superior to no treatment for patients in longer-term relationship. The general health and wellness intervention was not beneficial for men in shorter relationships and for men who did not endorse traditional masculine norms. Spouses in IET showed greater increases in relationship satisfaction than spouses in GHW and UC between the baseline and 5-week follow-up. Among patients in longer relationships, significant increases in psychological adjustment were found in both treatments compared to UC. Among spouses in longer relationships, psychological adjustment increased in both IET and UC but declined in GHW.

This pilot randomised controlled trial aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability and compliance with propolis in breast cancer patients receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, testing preliminary clinical efficacy of propolis in the prevention of OM, and prospectively evaluating the incidence of OM. Sixty patients were randomised to receive either a dry extract of propolis with 8%-12% of galangin plus mouth rinsing with sodium bicarbonate (experimental arm), or mouth rinsing with sodium bicarbonate (control arm). OM was evaluated with the NCI-CTCAE v4.0 after 5, 10, 15 and 21 days of treatment. Compliance with, tolerability of propolis and adverse events were recorded. The incidence of OM was also prospectively evaluated for 6 months. Two patients (6.7%) manifested a suspected skin reaction to propolis. No patient in the experimental arm developed OM > G1, while in the control arm OM > G1 was 16.7% (p = .02). The incidence of OM ≥ G1 at the end of cycles 2-8 was higher at the second (25%) and fifth cycles (45.8%).

A total of 337 participants (Intervention Group [IG] n = 202; Usual Care Group [UCG] n = 177) returned the completed baseline questionnaires (T1). Details regarding accessing the website were provided to IG participants. Follow-up questionnaires were completed: (a) 3 months (T2) and (b) 6 months after baseline (T3). Outcomes included anxiety and depression (primary outcomes), quality of life (QoL) and unmet information needs. About 70% of the IG accessed the website, typically only once (median: 1, range 1-15), spending a median of 19 min (range: 1-315) on the site. Mean levels of anxiety and depression did not differ between the two groups at T1, T2 or T3. While improvement in total QoL was greater in the IG than UCG between T1 and T2, QoL scores did not differ between groups at T3. The number of unmet needs did not differ between the two groups at T3.

We hypothesized that this difference is due to the Japanese preference for cigarettes with charcoal-containing filters, which efficiently absorb selected gas phase components of mainstream smoke including the carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone. We analyzed a subset of smokers (396 cases and 545 controls) from a case-control study of lung cancer conducted in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The risk associated with charcoal filters (73% of all subjects) was evaluated after adjusting for age, sex, education and smoking dose. The odds ratio (OR) associated with charcoal compared with 'plain' cigarette filters was 1.2 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.9, 1.6). The histologic-specific risks were similar (e.g. OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.9, 2.1 for adenocarcinoma). The OR was 1.7 (95% CI 1.1, 2.9) in smokers who switched from 'plain' to charcoal brands. The mean daily number of cigarettes smoked in subjects who switched from 'plain' to charcoal brands was 22.5 and 23.0, respectively. The findings from this study did not indicate that charcoal filters were associated with an attenuated risk of lung cancer. As the detection of a modest benefit or risk (e.g. 10-20%) that can have significant public health impact requires large samples, the findings should be confirmed or refuted in larger studies.

This study investigated the effect of folate supplementation on genomic DNA methylation and DNA strand breaks in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene of the colonic mucosa, two provisional biomarkers of colon cancer. Both of these provisional biomarkers of colon cancer underwent accelerated improvement at 6 months with folate supplementation. However, these markers also improved with placebo at 1 yr. Therefore, potential confounding factors that seem to modulate these biomarkers need to be identified and corrected in order for these markers to serve as suitable surrogate endpoints in folate chemoprevention trials. Folate supplementation increased serum, red blood cell and colonic mucosal folate concentrations (p < 0.02). Folate supplementation also increased the extent of genomic DNA methylation at 6 months and 1 yr (p = 0.001), whereas placebo administration was associated with an increase in the extent of genomic DNA methylation only at 1 yr. Similarly, folate supplementation decreased the extent of p53 strand breaks in exons 5-8 at 6 months and 1 yr (p < 0.02), whereas placebo administration was associated with a decrease in the extent of p53 strand breaks only at 1 yr.

Changes in bacterial populations were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Bacterial profiles demonstrated changes in response to the consumption of both RS and NSP diets [analysis of similarities (ANOSIM): R=0.341-0.507, P<0.01]. A number of different DGGE bands with increased intensity in response to dietary intervention were attributed to as-yet uncultivated bacteria closely related to Ruminococcus bromii. A real-time PCR assay specific to the R. bromii group was applied to faecal samples from the dietary study and this group was found to comprise a significant proportion of the total community when individuals consumed their normal diets (4.4+/-2.6% of total 16S rRNA gene abundance) and numbers increased significantly (+/-67%, P<0.05) with the RS, but not the NSP, dietary intervention.

The study complies with the CONSORT checklist published in 2010. Concomitant use of radiation therapy, intravenous or metronomic therapies, or the intake of previous oral drugs was not allowed. Pts were randomly assigned to home care nursing programme (A) or standard care (B). In arm A, dedicated nurses provided information to pts, a daily record on which pts would take note of drugs and dosages and a telephone monitoring during the first two cycles of therapy. The primary outcome was the reduction in improper hospital accesses for grade 1-2 toxicity according to CTCAE v4.0. Our experience failed to support the role of a specific home care nursing programme for pts taking oral chemotherapy. An improved attention to specific educational practice and information offered to pts can explain these results.

Upon receiving approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the majority of the patients consented into the study were treated at the Texas Tech Breast Care Center. Included were patients who had a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer (Stages I-III), and were experiencing significant musculoskeletal symptoms associated to AIs. Only patients with an average pain score ≥ 4, as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) questionnaire, were included in the study. Participants received 2500 mcg of sublingual vitamin B12 daily for 90 days. Assessments at baseline and at 3 months included: BPI-SF pain scores, the impact on quality of life determined by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES), and correlative serum markers relative to baseline (a pre-post study). A total of forty-one patients were enrolled. Average pain scores were improved by 34% (P < .0001) at 3 months compared to baseline. In addition, a 23% improvement in worst pain was noted (P = .0003). Analysis of the results for the FACT-ES scoring showed improvement on all scales. No significant adverse events were observed. Decrease in pain score was correlated with increased serum B12 levels.

285,92178,Immunomodulatory activities of Yunzhi and Danshen in post-treatment breast cancer patients.,The American journal of Chinese medicine,16047556,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Discomfort and fatigue are usually arisen from anticancer therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or combination therapy, because of the suppressed immunological functions. Yunzhi (Coriolus versicolor) can modulate various immunological functions in vitro, in vivo, and in human clinical trials. Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) has been shown to benefit the circulatory system by its vasodilating and anti-dementia activity. The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of Yunzhi-Danshen capsules in post-treatment breast cancer patients. Eighty-two patients with breast cancer were recruited to take Yunzhi [50 mg/kg body weight, 100% polysaccharopeptide (PSP)] and Danshen (20 mg/kg body weight) capsules every day for a total of 6 months. EDTA blood samples were collected every 2 months for the investigation of immunological functions. Flow cytometry was used to assess the percentages and absolute counts of human lymphocyte subsets in whole blood. Plasma level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that the absolute counts of T-helper lymphocytes (CD4+), the ratio of T-helper (CD4+)/T suppressor and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8+), and the percentage and the absolute counts of B-lymphocytes were significantly elevated in patients with breast cancer after taking Yunzhi-Danshen capsules, while plasma slL-2R concentration was significantly decreased (all p < 0.05). Therefore, the regular oral consumption of Yunzhi-Danshen capsules could be beneficial for promoting immunological function in post-treatment of breast cancer patients.

286,93488,No effect of exercise on colon mucosal prostaglandin concentrations: a 12-month randomized controlled trial.,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",18006923,"A 12-month randomized controlled trial testing the effects of exercise on colon mucosal prostaglandin concentrations was conducted in men (n=95) and women (n=89). The exercise intervention included moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity, 60 min/d, 6 days/wk versus controls. Prostaglandin E(2) and F(2alpha) concentrations were measured in colon biopsies using an enzyme-linked immunoassay at baseline and at 12 months to assess changes in mean concentration for each group. Epidemiologic studies provide evidence that exercise is associated with reduced risk of colon cancer. Exercise may exert protective effects on the colon by influencing prostaglandin production. We hypothesized that an exercise intervention would decrease prostaglandin E(2) concentrations and increase prostaglandin F(2alpha) in colon biopsies compared with controls. A 12-month moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise intervention did not result in significant changes in colon mucosal prostaglandin concentrations. Baseline colon prostaglandin E(2) and F(2alpha) concentrations were not correlated with age, race, education, family history of colon cancer, previous polyps, body size, diet, smoking, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use, metabolic factors, or sex hormone levels. For both men and women, the exercise and control groups showed no change in mean prostaglandin E(2) or F(2alpha) between the baseline and 12-month biopsies. There was no difference in mean prostaglandin concentrations between exercisers and controls when exercisers were grouped by level of intervention adherence. Results were not modified by baseline age, body mass index, percentage of body fat, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use, history of adenomatous polyps, or family history of colon cancer.

The intervention may be more effective in survivors who have younger children or less experience with sun protection. Intervention delivery must be enhanced to maximize use. This is the first study to examine a sun protection intervention for children of melanoma survivors. Findings will guide interventions for this important population at increased melanoma risk. We studied whether a melanoma survivor-centered intervention was more effective than materials available to the general public in increasing children's sun protection. In a randomized controlled trial, melanoma survivors (n = 340) who had a child ≤ 12 years received a targeted sun protection intervention (DVD and booklets) or standard education. Primary outcomes were children's sunburns, children's sun protection, and survivors' psychosocial factors at baseline and postintervention (1 and 4 months). The intervention increased children's sunscreen reapplication at 1 month (P = 0.002) and use of wide-brimmed hats at 4 months (P = 0.045). There were no effects on other behaviors or sunburns. The intervention improved survivors' hats/clothing self-efficacy at both follow-up assessments (P = 0.026, 0.009). At 4 months, the intervention improved survivors' clothing intentions (P = 0.029), knowledge (P = 0.010), and outcome expectations for hats (P = 0.002) and clothing (P = 0.037). Children's sun protection increased with survivors' intervention use. The intervention was less effective in survivors who were female or who had a family history, older children, or children with higher baseline sun protection scores.

288,94009,Phase I clinical trial of oral curcumin: biomarkers of systemic activity and compliance.,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,15501961,"Curcumin, a polyphenolic antioxidant derived from a dietary spice, exhibits anticancer activity in rodents and in humans. Its efficacy appears to be related to induction of glutathione S-transferase enzymes, inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production, or suppression of oxidative DNA adduct (M(1)G) formation. We designed a dose-escalation study to explore the pharmacology of curcumin in humans. Fifteen patients with advanced colorectal cancer refractory to standard chemotherapies consumed capsules compatible with curcumin doses between 0.45 and 3.6 g daily for up to 4 months. Levels of curcumin and its metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Three biomarkers of the potential activity of curcumin were translated from preclinical models and measured in patient blood leukocytes: glutathione S-transferase activity, levels of M(1)G, and PGE(2) production induced ex vivo. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed. Curcumin and its glucuronide and sulfate metabolites were detected in plasma in the 10 nmol/L range and in urine. A daily dose of 3.6 g curcumin engendered 62% and 57% decreases in inducible PGE(2) production in blood samples taken 1 hour after dose on days 1 and 29, respectively, of treatment compared with levels observed immediately predose (P < 0.05). A daily oral dose of 3.6 g of curcumin is advocated for Phase II evaluation in the prevention or treatment of cancers outside the gastrointestinal tract. PGE(2) production in blood and target tissue may indicate biological activity. Levels of curcumin and its metabolites in the urine can be used to assess general compliance.

289,96062,Influence of a highly purified senna extract on colonic epithelium.,Digestion,10705175,"Crypts were shorter in Sen than in NSen in the transverse and sigmoid colon. LI was higher in Sen than in NSen in the entire colon. No difference in p53 expression was seen. Bcl-2 expression was higher in both groups when crypts were shorter and/or proliferation was increased. Sennosides induce acute massive cell loss probably by apoptosis, causing shorter crypts, and increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis to restore cellularity. These effects may reflect the mechanism for the suggested cancer-promoting effect of chronic sennoside use. Chronic use of sennoside laxatives often causes pseudomelanosis coli. A recent study suggested that pseudomelanosis coli is associated with an increased colorectal cancer risk. A single high dose of highly purified senna extract increased proliferation rate and reduced crypt length in the sigmoid colon compared to historical controls. To evaluate in a controlled study the effects of highly purified senna extract on cell proliferation and crypt length in the entire colon and on p53 and bcl-2 expression. Addition of a senna extract to colonic lavage was studied in 184 consecutive outpatients. From 32 randomised patients, 15 with sennosides (Sen), 17 without (NSen), biopsies were taken.

The intervention group received the LCCP additionally to the conventional treatment (LCCP group, n = 50). The control group (CG) was split into 2 groups, with (CG1, n = 33) and without (CG2, n = 17) weekly talks. The primary endpoint was quality of life (QoL) after 3 months. This pilot study describes a multimodal outpatient complementary therapy program conducted in parallel with conventional therapies and its potential to significantly improve QoL and reduce treatment-associated side effects. To substantiate these data, multicenter trials are needed. Evidence for complementary therapies as important strategies to relieve cancer treatment-associated symptoms is increasing. Mostly, these complementary therapies start at the end of adjuvant treatments, resulting in a long delay until the well-being of patients is addressed. Further, long distances between the rehabilitation center and the patients' residence hinder patients' compliance. In the LCCP group, QoL significantly improved after 3 months compared to CG2 (p = 0.022) but not compared to CG1.

Hospital is the most common place of cancer death but concerns regarding the quality of end-of-life care remain. Preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of the Liverpool Care Pathway on the quality of end-of-life care provided to adult cancer patients during their last week of life in hospital. The trial was performed within four hospital wards participating in the pilot implementation of the Italian version of the Liverpool Care Pathway programme. All cancer patients who died in the hospital wards 2-4 months before and after the implementation of the Italian version of Liverpool Care Pathway were identified. A total of 2 months after the patient's death, bereaved family members were interviewed using the Toolkit After-Death Family Interview (seven 0-100 scales assessing the quality of end-of-life care) and the Italian version of the Views of Informal Carers - Evaluation of Services (VOICES) (three items assessing pain, breathlessness and nausea-vomiting). An interview was obtained for 79 family members, 46 (73.0%) before and 33 (68.8%) after implementation of the Italian version of Liverpool Care Pathway. Following Italian version of Liverpool Care Pathway implementation, there was a significant improvement in the mean scores of four Toolkit scales: respect, kindness and dignity (+16.8; 95% confidence interval = 3.6-30.0; p = 0.015); family emotional support (+20.9; 95% confidence interval = 9.6-32.3; p < 0.001); family self-efficacy (+14.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.3-28.2; p = 0.049) and coordination of care (+14.3; 95% confidence interval = 4.2-24.3; p = 0.007).

Patients received an early palliative care intervention integrated with oncology care or usual oncology care alone. We used linear regression to determine if age (older or younger than 65) and sex moderated the effects of the intervention on quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)), and coping (Brief COPE) within lung and gastrointestinal subgroups. At 24 weeks, younger patients with lung cancer receiving early palliative care reported increased use of active coping ( B = 1.74; p = 0.02) and decreased use of avoidant coping ( B = -0.97; p = 0.02), but the effects of early palliative care on these outcomes were not significant for older patients. Male patients with lung cancer assigned to early palliative care reported better quality of life (FACT-G: B = 9.31; p = 0.01) and lower depression scores (PHQ-9: B = -2.82; p = 0.02), but the effects of early palliative care on these outcomes were not significant for female patients. At 24 weeks, we found no age or sex moderation effects within the gastrointestinal cancer subgroup. Age and sex moderate the effects of early palliative care for patients with advanced lung cancer. Early palliative care may need to be tailored to individuals' unique sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Early palliative care interventions enhance patient outcomes, including quality of life, mood, and coping, but it remains unclear whether certain subgroups of patients are more likely to benefit from early palliative care. We explored whether age and sex moderate the improved outcomes seen with early palliative care.

In the 6-mo follow-up, this positive effect on knowledge recall disappeared. Fact boxes increased knowledge relative to baseline but did not affect decision intentions or perceptions of having complete information to make decisions. In study 1, 120 men (30-75 y) completed a lab study. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 fact box formats on prostate cancer screening: a tabular fact box with numbers, a fact box with numbers and icon array, and a fact box with numbers, separate icon arrays, and text to describe each benefit and harm. Comprehension of information (while materials were present) and short-term knowledge recall were assessed. Study 2 recruited an online sample of 244 German men (40-75 y). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 fact box formats or widely distributed health information, and knowledge was assessed at baseline, shortly after presentation, and at 6-mo follow-up, along with comprehension while materials were present. Fact boxes employ evidence-based guidelines on risk communication to present benefits and harms of health interventions in a balanced and transparent format. However, little is known about their short- and long-term efficacy and whether designing fact boxes to present multiple outcomes with icon arrays would increase their efficacy. This study shows that fact boxes with and without icon arrays are equally effective at improving comprehension and knowledge recall over the short-term and are simple formats that can improve on current health information. Specifically, if fact boxes are used at the time or immediately before a decision is made, they promote informed decisions about prostate cancer screening.

Eighty-two undergraduate students acted as advisors to a hypothetical patient. They completed a knowledge test and rated their preferences for three options--breast-sparing surgery with radiation, mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery, and mastectomy followed by use of a breast prosthesis--before and after viewing a videotape or a booklet version of the educational materials. Both formats increased knowledge scores. Treatment preferences were not affected by reading the booklet, but viewing the videotape resulted in a preference shift toward breast-sparing surgery. This media difference may be due to features of the video that were not reproduced in the booklet, such as interviews with other patients. Knowledge gains were uncorrelated with preference changes.

Untrained family caregivers struggle with complicated medical management regimens for hospice patients. An intervention was tested to improve caregiver's perception of pain management and patient's pain. The overall perception of pain management was not changed by the participation in hospice team meetings. Perceptions of fatalism improved for intervention participants, and the intervention participants perceived their patients' pain was better controlled than those in the control group. The intervention was found to be feasible to deliver in rural areas. Caregiver's anxiety and patient's pain were correlated ( r = .18; P = .003), and subanalysis indicated that caregivers of patients with cancer may benefit more from the intervention than other hospice caregivers. Qualitative analyses provided understanding of caregiver's perceptions of pain, cost, and facilitators and barriers to routine involvement of family in care plan meetings. Limitations and Conclusion: The hospice philosophy is supportive of caregiver involvement in care planning, and technology makes this feasible; the intervention needs modification to become translational as well as additional measurement to assess effectiveness. Caregiver education and emotional support should occur outside the meeting, and a strong leader should facilitate the meeting to control efficiency. Finally, the intervention may benefit caregivers of patients with cancer more than others. Caregiver's perceptions of pain management were the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included caregiver quality of life, patient's pain, and anxiety. Video recordings, field notes, and caregiver and staff interviews provided qualitative data. The intervention was tested with a 2-group (usual care vs intervention) randomized controlled trial using parallel mixed-methods analysis of 446 caregivers in 3 Midwestern hospice programs representing rural and urban settings.

306,100335,Potential attenuation of disease progression in recurrent prostate cancer with plant-based diet and stress reduction.,Integrative cancer therapies,16880425,"A rising level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), after primary surgery or radiation therapy, is the hallmark of recurrent prostate cancer and is often the earliest sign of extraprostatic spread in patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. While hormonal therapy may slightly extend survival in a minority of patients, it is not curative and produces side effects including hot flashes, decreased libido, and loss of bone mass. Alternatively, dietary modification may offer an important tool for clinical management. Epidemiologic studies have associated the Western diet not only with prostate cancer incidence but also with a greater risk of disease progression after treatment. Conversely, many elements of plant-based diets have been associated with reduced risk of progression. However, dietary modification can be stressful and difficult to implement. We therefore conducted a 6-month pilot clinical trial to investigate whether adoption of a plant-based diet, reinforced by stress management training, could attenuate the rate of further PSA rise. Urologists at the University of California, San Diego, and San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Centers recruited 14 patients with recurrent prostate cancer. A pre-post design was employed in which each patient served as his own control. Rates of PSA rise were ascertained for each patient for the following periods: from the time of posttreatment recurrence up to the start of the study (prestudy) and from the time immediately preceding the intervention (baseline) to the end of the intervention (0-6 months). There was a significant decrease in the rate of PSA rise from prestudy to 0 to 6 months (P < .01). Four of 10 evaluable patients experienced an absolute reduction in their PSA levels over the entire 6-month study. Nine of 10 had a reduction in their rates of PSA rise and an improvement of their PSA doubling times. Median PSA doubling time increased from 11.9 months (prestudy) to 112.3 months (intervention). These results provide preliminary evidence that adoption of a plant-based diet, in combination with stress reduction, may attenuate disease progression and have therapeutic potential for clinical management of recurrent prostate cancer.

307,100337,Pilot crossover trial of Reiki versus rest for treating cancer-related fatigue.,Integrative cancer therapies,17351024,"Fatigue is an extremely common side effect experienced during cancer treatment and recovery. Limited research has investigated strategies stemming from complementary and alternative medicine to reduce cancer-related fatigue. This research examined the effects of Reiki, a type of energy touch therapy, on fatigue, pain, anxiety, and overall quality of life. This study was a counterbalanced crossover trial of 2 conditions: (1) in the Reiki condition, participants received Reiki for 5 consecutive daily sessions, followed by a 1-week washout monitoring period of no treatments, then 2 additional Reiki sessions, and finally 2 weeks of no treatments, and (2) in the rest condition, participants rested for approximately 1 hour each day for 5 consecutive days, followed by a 1-week washout monitoring period of no scheduled resting and an additional week of no treatments. In both conditions, participants completed questionnaires investigating cancer-related fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue subscale [FACT-F]) and overall quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, General Version [FACT-G]) before and after all Reiki or resting sessions. They also completed a visual analog scale (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System [ESAS]) assessing daily tiredness, pain, and anxiety before and after each session of Reiki or rest. Sixteen patients (13 women) participated in the trial: 8 were randomized to each order of conditions (Reiki then rest; rest then Reiki). They were screened for fatigue on the ESAS tiredness item, and those scoring greater than 3 on the 0 to 10 scale were eligible for the study. They were diagnosed with a variety of cancers, most commonly colorectal (62.5%) cancer, and had a median age of 59 years. Fatigue on the FACT-F decreased within the Reiki condition (P=.05) over the course of all 7 treatments. In addition, participants in the Reiki condition experienced significant improvements in quality of life (FACT-G) compared to those in the resting condition (P <.05). On daily assessments (ESAS) in the Reiki condition, presession 1 versus postsession 5 scores indicated significant decreases in tiredness (P <.001), pain (P <.005), and anxiety (P<.01), which were not seen in the resting condition. Future research should further investigate the impact of Reiki using more highly controlled designs that include a sham Reiki condition and larger sample sizes.

Race, age, marital status, and congruence of preferred and achieved levels of involvement also predicted aspects of HRQOL in breast cancer survivors ( P < .05). This study sought to describe changes in the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of women who do and do not seek naturopathic oncology (NO) complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) care during and immediately after breast cancer treatment, and to explore the predictive role of NO CAM care, demographic characteristics, and involvement in decision-making on HRQOL in breast cancer survivors. Matched cohorts of breast cancer survivors who did and did not choose to supplement their breast cancer treatment with NO care within 2 years of diagnosis participated. NO users were identified through naturopathic doctors' clinics and usual care (UC) controls with similar prognosis were identified through a cancer registry. The registry provided information about all participants' age, race, ethnicity, marital status, stage of cancer at time of diagnosis, date of diagnosis, and use of conventional medical treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and endocrine therapy). Data of participants' self-reported involvement in decision-making and HRQOL were collected at study enrollment and at 6-month follow-up.

However, further investigations with larger samples and higher doses of vibration are warranted. To examine the effect of vibration stimulus on markers of bone turnover in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors. Women with breast cancer are often prescribed aromatase inhibitors, which can cause rapid loss of bone mass leading to significant potential for morbidity. Vibration training has been shown to be helpful in reducing bone turnover in postmenopausal women without cancer. Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12611001094965). ).

No significant effects sizes were observed for psychophysiological outcomes. Effect sizes ranged from 0.54 (cortisol) to 0 (interleukin-1β [IL-1β]). Decreasing overall trends were observed for cortisol levels for all 6 pediatric osteosarcoma patients over time. In addition, a similar pattern of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels over time was found for all 6 patients. Patients with metastatic osteosarcoma showed a linear trend for a decrease in MMP-9 levels between 1 and 9 hours after the clown intervention and restoration to basal levels after 13 hours. The results of this pilot study suggest that it is feasible longitudinally measure psychophysiological outcomes in the pediatric osteosarcoma inpatients for chemotherapy. Clown intervention merits further study as a way to reduce stress as well as fatigue, since that the stress and cytokines measurements are feasible based on our work. Pediatric cancer patients experience different psychological processes during hospitalization that may regulate the immune response and affect recovery and response to cancer treatment. In this study, we aimed to examine the feasibility of longitudinal testing of psychophysiological parameters of stress and fatigue in pediatric osteosarcoma patients hospitalized for chemotherapy submitted to clown intervention; and to investigate whether changes in the levels of biomarkers are associated with psychological stress and fatigue levels in these patients after the clown intervention. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental pilot study was conducted at the pediatric oncology inpatient unit in a comprehensive cancer care center in Brazil including children and adolescents with osteosarcoma hospitalized for chemotherapy. Eight saliva samples were collected, comprising 4 at baseline (pre-intervention) and 4 after the clown intervention (+1, +4, +9, and +13 hours post-awakening).

Follow-up evaluations were conducted 3 weeks after the end of treatments. The grade and dosage of analgesics for cancer pain, pain intensity, quality of life, and safety were assessed. Twenty-seven patients (90%) completed 6-week trial, and no serious adverse events were associated with either IA or sham IA procedures except the transient side effect such as fatigue. Nine patients in the IA group (64.3%) and 5 in the sham IA group (38.5%) responded to the 3-week intervention. These patients were mostly in the nonopioid and the weak opioid levels of the World Health Organization analgesic ladder. Self-reported pain declined by -1.54 ± 1.45 and -1.15 ± 1.57 in the IA and sham IA groups, respectively, with improved quality of life reported. IA treatment appears feasible and safe for advanced cancer patients. It might reduce analgesic usage in the early World Health Organization analgesic ladder stage cancer patient, though it could not show significant outcome differences due to design limitation of sham IA. Ninety percent of patients with advanced cancer have moderate to severe pain, and up to 70% of patients with cancer pain do not receive adequate pain relief.

The findings support that an adequate system should be set up to provide routine psychological interventions for cancer patients in Chinese medical settings. However, because of some clear limitations (heterogeneity and publication bias), these results should be interpreted with caution. We retrieved 147 studies (covering 14,039 patients) that reported 253 experimental-control comparisons. The random effects model showed a significant large effect size for depression (SMD = 1.199, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.095-1.303) and anxiety (SMD = 1.298, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.187-1.408). Cumulative meta-analysis indicated that sufficient evidence had accumulated since 2000-2001 to confirm the statistically significant effectiveness of psychological interventions on depression and anxiety in Chinese cancer patients. Moderating effects were found for caner type, patients' selection, intervention format and questionnaires used. In studies that included lung cancer, preselected patients with clear signs of depression/anxiety, adopted individual intervention and used State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the effect sizes were larger. The four most comprehensive Chinese academic database- CNKI, Wanfang, Vip and CBM databases-were searched from their inception until January 2014. PubMed and Web of Science (SCIE) were also searched from their inception until January 2014 without language restrictions, and an internet search was used. Randomized controlled studies assessing the effects of psychological interventions on depression and anxiety among Chinese adults with cancer were analyzed. Study selection and appraisal were conducted independently by three authors. The pooled random-effects estimates of standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Moderator analysis (meta-regression and subgroup analysis) was used to explore reasons for heterogeneity. Our previous studies found the high prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese cancer patients, and many empirical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on depression and anxiety among Chinese cancer patients.

We evaluated the efficacy of isoflavone in patients with PSA recurrent prostate cancer after prior therapy. We postulated that isoflavone therapy would slow the rate of rise of serum PSA. Dietary intervention with isoflavone supplementation may have biologic activity in men with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer as shown by a decline in the slope of PSA. This study may lend support to the literature that nutritional supplements have biologic activity in prostate cancer and therefore, further studies with these agents in randomized clinical trials should be encouraged. Within the mixed regression model, it was estimated that PSA had increased 56% per year before study entry and only increased 20% per year for the 12-month study period (p = 0.05). Specifically, the slope of PSA after study entry was significantly lower than that before study entry in 6 patients and the slope of PSA after study entry was significantly higher than before study entry in 2 patients. For the remaining 12 patients, the change in slope was statistically insignificant. Nearly two thirds of the patients were noted to have significant levels of free equol in their serum while on therapy.

Both GROUP and HOME interventions in men with PC on ADT appeared to be similar to PT for multiple efficacy outcomes, although conclusions are limited by a small sample size and cost considerations have not been incorporated. Efforts need to be targeted to improving recruitment and adherence. A larger trial is warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02046837 . Date of registration: January 20, 2014. Fifty-nine participants (mean age 69.9 years) were enrolled. The recruitment rate was 25.4% and recruitment was slower than projected. Retention was 71.2%. Exercise adherence as measured through attendance was high for supervised sessions but under 50% by self-report and accelerometry. Satisfaction was high and there was no difference in this measure between all three groups. Between-group differences (comparing both GROUP and HOME to PT) were smaller than the minimum clinically important difference on most measures of QOL, fatigue, and fitness. However, two of six outcomes for GROUP and four of six outcomes for HOME had a > 20% probability of being inferior for GROUP. Men with prostate cancer on ADT were recruited from one of two experienced Canadian centres and randomized 1:1:1 to PT, GROUP, or HOME. Randomization was stratified by length of ADT use and site. Participants completed moderate intensity aerobic and resistance exercises 4-5 days per week for 6 months with a target 150 min per week of exercise. Exercise prescriptions were individualized and progressed throughout the trial. Feasibility endpoints included recruitment, retention, adherence, and participant satisfaction. The efficacy endpoints QOL, fatigue, and fitness (VO2 peak, grip strength, and timed chair stands) in GROUP and HOME were compared for non-inferiority to PT. Descriptive analyses were used for feasibility endpoints. Between-group differences for efficacy endpoints were examined using Bayesian linear mixed effects models. Existing evidence demonstrates that 1:1 personal training (PT) improves many adverse effects of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Whether less resource-intensive exercise delivery models are as effective remains to be established. We determined the feasibility of conducting a multi-center non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing PT with supervised group (GROUP) and home-based (HOME) exercise programs, and obtained preliminary efficacy estimates for GROUP and HOME compared to PT on quality of life (QOL) and physical fitness.

Sociodemographic factors (age, education), clinical factors (pain and no progressive disease) and the expressed need to talk to a professional predicted use of psychosocial services. Identification of these predictors may contribute to the understanding of factors that determine the need for psychosocial services. Patients completed measures on psychological distress, physical distress, and quality of life at baseline. Demographics, clinical characteristics at baseline and clinical events during treatment (e.g. severe adverse events, clinical benefit) were extracted from patient records. Patients reported psychosocial service utilization in- and outside the hospital after 10, 24 and 48 weeks of treatment. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors for the use of psychosocial services. Patients with advanced disease experience high levels of psychological distress, yet there is low uptake of psychosocial services offered to patients who screened positive for distress. In this study we aimed to identify predictors for use of psychosocial services in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receiving first line chemotherapy enrolled in a prospective cluster randomized trial (CRT). Out of 349 patients, seventy patients (20.0%) used psychosocial support services during the follow-up period. Use of psychosocial services was associated with younger age, a higher educational level, presence of more pain (at baseline), and the expressed need to talk to a professional (at baseline).

Physical activity (PA) has been associated with better processing speed and memory in healthy adults and thus may be a useful method for improving cognition in BCS. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an acute bout of PA on processing speed and spatial working memory in a sample of BCS. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02592070 . Registered 30 October 2015. Retroactively registered. The moderate effect of acute exercise on domains of memory and processing speed in BCS is encouraging. Cancer-related cognitive impairment remains largely misunderstood; however, the results from the present study offer preliminary evidence for the positive relationship between acute exercise and cognition in BCS. Within-subjects repeated measures analyses of variance revealed a significant time by session effect for processing speed reaction time [F (1,25) = 5.02, p = .03, η2 = 0.17]. This interaction was driven by significantly reduced reaction time (e.g., faster response) post-exercise and no change post-rest. Further between-subjects analyses indicated a significant time by session by moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) split [F (1,25) = 5.23, p = .03, η2 = 0.17], such that women who engaged in ≥45 min of average daily MVPA reduced their reaction time post-exercise (p = .01) and increased RT post-rest (p = .06). Time by session effects for spatial working memory 3-item accuracy and 4-item reaction time trended towards significance, p = 0.08 and p = 0.10, respectively, again driven by better performance post-exercise.

Participants will be allocated to either a control group receiving cancer-specific lifestyle advice alone or one of three intervention groups receiving the same lifestyle advice alongside their estimated 10-year risk of developing one of the five most common preventable cancers, calculated from self-reported modifiable behavioural risk factors, in one of three different formats (bar chart, pictograph or qualitative scale). The primary outcome is change from baseline in computed risk relative to an individual with a recommended lifestyle at three months. Secondary outcomes include: perceived risk of cancer; anxiety; cancer-related worry; intention to change behaviour; and awareness of cancer risk factors. This study will provide evidence on the short-term effect of providing online information about personalised risk of cancer alongside lifestyle advice on risk perception and health-related behaviours and inform the development of interventions. ISRCTN17450583. Registered 30 January 2018. Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Prevention is recognised by many, including the World Health Organization, to offer the most cost-effective long-term strategy for the control of cancer. One approach that focuses on individuals is the provision of personalised risk information. However, whether such information motivates behaviour change and whether the effect is different with varying formats of risk presentation is unclear. We aim to assess the short-term effect of providing information about personalised risk of cancer in three different formats alongside lifestyle advice on health-related behaviours, risk perception and risk conviction.

Participants (n = 36; mean ± SD age 64.8 ± 9.6 years; 44.1 ± 30.8 months since treatment) were randomized 1:1 to receive the text message-enhanced clinical exercise rehabilitation program, or the standard clinical exercise rehabilitation program alone. Activity was assessed at baseline, 4-weeks (end of the standard program) and 12-weeks (end of enhanced program) using both device (activPAL accelerometer; sitting, standing, light-stepping, moderate-stepping) and self-report [Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults (MARCA); sedentary, light, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)] methods. The MARCA also assessed time use domains to provide context to activity changes. Changes and intervention effects were evaluated using linear mixed models, adjusting for baseline values and potential confounders. Results demonstrate feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of a novel, text message-enhanced clinical exercise rehabilitation program to support changes in whole-of-day activity, including both physical activity and sedentary behavior. Changes were largely seen at 12-week follow-up, indicating potential for the intervention to result in continued improvement and maintenance of behavior change following a supervised exercise intervention. Exercise interventions are typically delivered to people with cancer and survivors via supervised clinical rehabilitation. However, motivating and maintaining activity changes outside of the clinic setting remains challenging. This study investigated the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of an individually-tailored, text message-enhanced intervention that focused on increasing whole-of-day activity both during and beyond a 4-week, supervised clinical exercise rehabilitation program for people with cancer and survivors. The study had high retention (86%) and participants reported high levels of satisfaction [4.3/5 (±0.8)] with the intervention. Over the first 4 weeks, MARCA-assessed MVPA increased [+ 53.2 (95%CI: 2.9, 103.5) min/d] between groups, favoring the text message-enhanced program, but there were no significant intervention effects on sedentary behavior. By 12 weeks, relative to the standard group, participants in the text message-enhanced group sat less [activPAL overall sitting: - 48.2 (- 89.9, - 5.6) min/16 h awake; MARCA: -80.1 (- 156.5, - 3.8) min/d] and were participating in more physical activity [activPAL light stepping: + 7.0 (0.4, 13.6: min/16 h awake; MARCA MVPA: + 67.3 (24.0, 110.6) min/d].

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, such as fecal occult blood test (FOBT), is an effective way to prevent CRC, one of the most common cancers worldwide. However, studies found that South Asian ethnic minorities tend not to utilize CRC screening, whose importance on CRC prevention shall be educated among those from ethnic minorities, especially older adults. The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a family-based, multimedia intervention to augment the knowledge of CRC prevention among older South Asian adults in Hong Kong and enhance their motivation for undergoing FOBT. The acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be carried out. Three hundred and twenty South Asian dyads, comprising an older adult aged between 50 and 75 and a younger family member aged between 18 and 49, will be recruited in ten districts in Hong Kong through community organizations that provide support services for South Asians in local communities. Dyads will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or wait-list control group. Intervention dyads will receive intervention, whose contents are based on the health belief model, via multiple forms of media including PowerPoint presentation, video clip and health information booklet. Control dyads will receive intervention after post-intervention data are collected. For dyads in both groups, an appointment with a family doctor will be arranged for those willing to undergo FOBT. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Data will be analysed using the Generalised Linear Models Procedure in an intention-to-treat manner. Findings of this study will provide evidence of the benefits of utilizing multimedia and family-based approaches in intervention development to enhance the effectiveness of health promotion interventions for ethnic minorities. Further, the findings would provide reference to the potential incorporation of the intervention in the existing support services for South Asian ethnic minorities in local communities.

We will conduct the randomized controlled trial to provide scientific evidence on the potential effect of the IMB theory-based intervention. Findings from this study will contribute to a growing research field which assesses the effectiveness of mobile-based, school-targeted and theoretically guided interventions for promoting HPV vaccination in adolescents. This investigation is a multicenter, school-based, prospective, randomized, parallel group, double-blind, blank-controlled trial involving a 7-day education intervention with a further 6-month follow-up. We will enroll at least 3360 participants older than 18 years. The enrolled participants will be randomly divided into two groups (1:1 ratio). The intervention group will be offered a 7-day mobile health education, and participants in both groups will fill out 4 questionnaires at the baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the intervention. The primary outcome is the difference in HPV vaccination or reservation for the HPV vaccine between the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes will include the comparison of (1) knowledge, attitudes, motivation, beliefs and behavioral skill about HPV and cervical cancer prevention, and (2) the willingness to uptake HPV vaccination. While the HPV vaccines have been approved by the US FDA since 2006, in recent years an increasing number of women are living with cervical cancer globally. Among them, Chinese women have a higher cervical cancer incidence and mortality rate than the global average, with mortality rates being almost twice the global average. However, the current approach of HPV vaccination in China is not satisfactory given the high disease burden of cervical cancer. The current study is a randomized controlled trial designed to identify the barriers and facilitators of HPV vaccination among Chinese female students. This study will also test a health intervention measure via a popular form of new media in order to improve the HPV vaccine uptake under the framework of Information-Motivation-Behavioral skill Model (IMB).

This systematic review was conducted to investigate the anticancer and detoxification effects of MTE, as an adjuvant therapy to chemotherapy, for treating gastric cancer. The current evidence with limitations of risk of selection and performance bias suggests that MTE, as an adjuvant therapy to chemotherapy, is effective for inhibiting cancer growth and reducing incidences of multiple chemotherapy side effects. Oral MTE may be a better choice. Uncertainty remains regarding the effects of MTE on survival endpoints and the subgroup differences between acute and chronic use of MTE and between different chemotherapy regimens. Seventeen RCTs with 1329 individuals were included, with a moderate to high risk of selection and performance bias. Compared to chemotherapy alone, MTE adjuvant therapy significantly improved the response to anticancer treatment (POR 2.01, 95% CI 1.60-2.53) and patients' performance status (POR 3.15, 95% CI 2.22-4.48) and reduce the incidences of chemotherapy-induced leukopenia (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.56-0.78), thrombocytopenia (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.86), anemia (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72-1.10), nausea/vomiting (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91), hepatic injury (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.96), and peripheral neurotoxicity (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-1.01). However, MTE did not significantly alleviate anemia, diarrhea, constipation, kidney injury, and oral mucosal lesions after chemotherapy. Incidence of nausea/vomiting was lower in patients receiving oral MTE than those receiving injectable MTE (RR 0.47 vs. 0.82, interaction P = 0.04). Heterogeneity was generally low among these outcomes. Three out of five RCTs that reported survival data supported the effects of MTE for prolonging progression-free and/or overall survival. No studies reported safety outcomes of MTE. Ten databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral or injectable MTE plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treating gastric cancer up to May 1, 2019. In meta-analyses, proportional odds ratios (PORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for the ordinal outcomes using the generalized linear model, and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were pooled for dichotomous outcomes using the Mantel-Haenszel method.

Registered on 15 August 2015. Study Within A Trial, SWAT-23. Registered on 12 April 2016. Written participant information materials are important for ensuring that potential trial participants receive necessary information so that they can provide informed consent. However, such materials are frequently long and complex, which may negatively impact patient understanding and willingness to participate. Improving readability, ease of comprehension and presentation may assist with improved participant recruitment. The Systematic Techniques for Assisting Recruitment to Trials (MRC START) study aimed to develop and evaluate interventions to improve trial recruitment. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of an optimised participant information brochure and cover letter developed by MRC START regarding response and participant recruitment rates. We conducted a study within a trial (SWAT) embedded in the EarlyCDT Lung Cancer Scotland (ECLS) trial that aimed to assess the effectiveness of a new test in reducing the incidence of patients with late-stage lung cancer at diagnosis compared with standard care. Potential participants approached for ECLS were randomised to receive the original participant information brochure and accompanying letter (control group) or optimised versions of these materials which had undergone user testing and a process of re-writing, re-organisation and professional graphic design (intervention group). The primary outcome was the number of patients recruited to ECLS. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients expressing an interest in participating in ECLS. In total, 2262 patients were randomised, 1136 of whom were sent the intervention materials and 1126 of whom were sent the control materials.

Practical challenges such as poor recruitment and inadequate resource allocation can hamper the assessment of such interventions with clinical trial methodology. This paper highlights the challenges encountered during a pilot randomized controlled trial of an m-health medication adherence intervention and offers recommendations for future multi-site, non-drug clinical trials. Eighteen patients were recruited to the study; eight were randomly allocated to the intervention arm. Intervention participants responded to their daily medication-reminder text messages, indicating that medication had been taken or not, and nurses were able to organize their calls around their workload. The trial closed prematurely primarily due to inadequate numbers of eligible patients; however, other potentially resolvable feasibility issues were identified. These included lack of infrastructure at study sites, poor screening data acquisition and management processes, and inexperience in conducting supportive care trials at participating sites. M-health intervention trials are designed to inform implementation of best supportive care practice.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but these can be reduced significantly with population screening using annual fecal occult blood tests (FOBT)A positive FOBT requires timely follow-up with colonoscopy to maximize screening benefits.. Several barriers to follow-up have been identified, with patient health behaviors and choices comprising a significant part of these. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) assesses knowledge, skills, beliefs, and confidence in managing health. Increased patient activation is related to positive health outcomes. The aim of this study is to examine the association between patient empowerment, as reflected in the PAM, and follow-up colonoscopy within 90 days of a positive FOBT result. This case-control study included 429 patients with a positive FOBT, 174 who had a colonoscopy within 90 days, and 255 who did not.. Participants completed a PAM telephone questionnaire (Cronbach's α = 0.785). We used both univariate and multivariate analyses to examine the effect of the PAM score as on the likelihood of undergoing colonoscopy, after adjusting for the independent variables. In this study we did not find a significant association between PAM and adherence to colonoscopy, using both univariate and multivariate analyses (p = .334 and p = .697, whether PAM was defined as a continuous or as categorical, respectively). This study was the first to examine the association between patient empowerment, as reflected in the patient activation measure, and adherence to colonoscopy after a positive FOBT. The findings did not support such an association. Further examination is required to clarify the relation between patient empowerment and activation and personal healthcare in general, and in the Israeli population in particular. Future policy should include specific, technical interventions to improve FOBT follow-up among all groups, until the patient-related barriers are better understood.

Telehealth video visits (televisits) were conducted monthly by using a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant smartphone application. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility of telemedicine-enabled study visits. Secondary objectives were defining safety, anticancer activity, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. To our knowledge, this interventional oncology clinical trial is the first to be conducted through telemedicine. Telemedicine-enabled trials are feasible and may overcome geographic barriers to trial participation. Metformin was generally well tolerated but associated with modest anticancer activity. Fifteen patients with a median age of 68 years (range, 57 to 83 years) and median one-way driving time to the study center of 71 minutes (range, 12 to 147 minutes) were enrolled.

Dietary counseling increased daily energy intake by approximately 1 MJ and protein intake by 10 g over the entire study period. There was no change in the control group. Counseling led to an insignificant increase in body weight, but triceps skinfold measurement increased significantly after 5 months. Response rate and overall survival did not differ between the groups. Quality of life measured by the Quality-of-Life index (QL-index) increased significantly in both groups, but did not differ between groups. This study examined the effect of frequent nutritional counseling on oral intake, body weight, response rate, survival, and quality of life in patients with cancer of the lung (small-cell), ovary, or breast undergoing cyclic chemotherapy. Of 105 assessable patients, 57 were randomized to receive nutritional counseling, and 48 to receive no nutritional counseling and consumption of an ad lib oral intake. The intervention group was counseled to achieve a daily energy and protein intake according to recommended dietary allowances. Counseling was standardized and performed by a trained dietitian, and took place twice monthly during a 5-month period from start of chemotherapy.

During the first 4 weeks, average vaginal dryness decreased by 62% and 64% in the placebo and Replens groups, respectively (P = .3). Average dyspareunia scores also improved by 41% and 60%, respectively (P = .05). Crossover analysis indicated that the bulk of the beneficial effects appeared within the first 2 weeks of the first treatment and remained constant thereafter. Both treatments were relatively well tolerated. Both Replens and the placebo appear to substantially ameliorate vaginal dryness and dyspareunia in breast cancer survivors. A double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial was developed. Patients received 4 weeks of Replens (Columbia Research Laboratories, Rockville Centre, NY) followed by a 1-week washout period followed by 4 weeks of a placebo lubricating product, or vice versa. Weekly patient-completed diaries were used for measuring efficacies and toxicities of therapy. Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia are significant estrogen-depletion symptoms that affect many breast cancer survivors.

342,109690,Phase I/II trial of the safety and efficacy of shark cartilage in the treatment of advanced cancer.,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,9817287,"Patients with cancer and chronic inflammatory disorders have used shark cartilage (SC) preparations for many years. Preclinical studies that support their beneficial effects are scanty, and reports of clinical trials have been anecdotal. The proposed mechanisms of antitumor action include direct or indirect inhibition of angiogenesis. Because of the emerging use of SC as an alternative to conventional cancer therapy, this trial was launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SC. Under the specific conditions of this study, SC as a single agent was inactive in patients with advanced-stage cancer and had no salutary effect on quality of life. The 16.7% rate of SD was similar to results in patients with advanced cancer treated with supportive care alone. Ten of 60 patients were lost to follow-up(LTFU) or refused further treatment (RFT) before the 6-week evaluation and were not assessable for toxicity and response. Three patients with stable disease at 6 weeks were LTFU or RFT thereafter. Of the 47 fully assessable patients, five were taken off study because of gastrointestinal toxicity or intolerance to SC. Progressive disease (PD) at 6 or 12 weeks occurred in 22 and five patients, respectively. Five patients died of PD while undergoing SC therapy. No complete (CRs) or partial responses (PRs) were noted. Median time to tumor progression in the entire study population was 7+/-9.7 weeks (mean, 11.4 weeks; range, 3.7 to 45.7 weeks). Ten (20%) of 50 assessable patients, or 16.7% of the 60 intent-to-treat patients, had stable disease (SD) for 12 weeks or more. The median time to tumor progression was 27 weeks, the mean was 28.8+/-9.9 weeks, and the range was 18.6 to 45.7 weeks. In this subset, FACT-G scores improved in four patients, were unchanged in four patients, and declined in two patients. Twenty-one adverse events (grade 1, eight events; grade 2, seven events; and grade 3, six events) were recorded, 14 of which were gastroenterologic (nausea, vomiting, constipation). Sixty adult patients with advanced previously treated cancer (breast, 16 patients; colorectal, 16 patients; lung, 14 patients; prostate, eight patients; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, three patients; brain, one patient; and unknown primary tumor, two patients) were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included confirmation of diagnosis, resistance to conventional therapy, objective measurable disease, life expectancy of 12 weeks or greater, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, no recent or concomitant anticancer therapy, no prior SC, and informed consent. Patients underwent evaluation of the extent of disease, quality-of-life score (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G] scale), and hematologic, biochemical, and selected immune function studies at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of SC therapy. The dose of SC was 1 g/kg daily orally in three divided doses. Standard criteria were used to evaluate adverse events and response.

These findings suggest that comprehensive pain assessment and evidence-based analgesic decision-making processes do enhance usual pain outcomes. Patients randomized to the pain algorithm group achieved a statistically significant reduction in usual pain intensity, measured as slope scores, when compared with standard community practice (P < .02). Concurrent chemotherapy and patient adherence to treatment were significant mediators of worst pain. There were no significant differences in other symptoms or quality of life between the two treatment groups. Eighty-one cancer patients, aged 37 to 76 years, were enrolled onto a prospective, longitudinal, randomized controlled study from the outpatient clinic settings of 26 western Washington-area medical oncologists. A multilevel treatment algorithm based on the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Guidelines for Cancer Pain Management was compared with standard-practice (control) pain and symptom management therapies used by community oncologists. The primary outcome of interest was pain (Brief Pain Inventory); secondary outcomes of interest were all other symptoms (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale) and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale). Pain and symptom management is an integral part of the clinical practice of oncology. A number of guidelines have been developed to assist the clinician in optimizing comfort care.

A total of 49 patients were studied. median age, 57 years (range, 27 to 77 years); 23 patients were women (47%); 98% had a Zubrod PS of 1%; 98% had PS of 1; and 21 had non-small-cell lung, 19 had head & neck cancer, three had mesothelioma, and six had other. Mild to moderate toxicities were seen at most dose levels and promptly reversed on discontinuation of GTE. Dose-limiting toxicities were caffeine related and included neurologic and gastrointestinal effects. The maximum-tolerated dose was 4.2 g/m(2) once daily or 1.0 g/m(2) three times daily. No major responses occurred; 10 patients with stable disease completed 6 months of GTE. Pharmacokinetic analyses found accumulation of caffeine levels that were dose dependent, whereas epigallocatechin gallate levels did not accumulate nor appear dose related. A dose of 1.0 g/m(2) tid (equivalent to 7 to 8 Japanese cups [120 mL] of green tea three times daily) is recommended for future studies. The side effects of this preparation of GTE were caffeine related. Oral GTE at the doses studied can be taken safely for at least 6 months.

All 129 patients enrolled from 14 institutions between February 1998 and October 1999 were eligible. Patients received 4 g of glutamine or placebo orally, twice a day, beginning with the first or second day of RT and continuing for 2 weeks after RT. During treatment, patients were assessed weekly for toxicity, and a bowel function questionnaire was administered. The primary measures of treatment efficacy were diarrhea levels measured by maximum grade of diarrhea, incidence of diarrhea, and average diarrhea score. After completion of RT, the bowel function questionnaire was administered weekly for 4 weeks and at 12 and 24 months. Toxicity was measured by National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria. The median age of patients was 69 years (range, 34 to 86 years). The two treatment arms were balanced with respect to all baseline factors. There were no significant differences in toxicity by treatment. Quality-of-life scores and the mean number of problems reported on the bowel function questionnaire were virtually identical for both treatment groups. The incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea was 20% for the glutamine arm and 19% for the placebo arm (P =.99).

Although the ratings for pain intensity and pain interference decreased over time for both groups, there was no statistically significant difference between groups. Pain education did not affect quality of life, perceived pain control, or functional status. African American patients in the education but not the control group reported a significant decrease in pain worst ratings from baseline to first follow-up (P < .01), although this decrease was not maintained at subsequent assessments. Brief education had limited impact on pain outcomes for underserved minority patients, suggesting that more intensive education for patients and interventions for physicians are needed. Previous studies found that African American and Hispanic cancer patients are at risk for undertreatment of pain. We evaluated the efficacy of a pain education intervention for underserved minority patients. Ninety-seven underserved African American and Hispanic outpatients with cancer-related pain were enrolled onto a randomized clinical trial of pain management education. The patients in the education group received a culture-specific video and booklet on pain management. The control group received a video and booklet on nutrition. A research nurse met with each patient to review the materials.

The primary end point was the occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher. Prognostic factors, including treatment modalities and patient characteristics, were also investigated. Secondary end points were the occurrence of pain, the quantity of topical agent used, and patient satisfaction. The effectiveness of nonsteroid topical agents for the prevention of acute dermatitis during adjuvant radiotherapy for breast carcinoma has not been demonstrated. The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of calendula (Pommade au Calendula par Digestion; Boiron Ltd, Levallois-Perret, France) with that of trolamine (Biafine; Genmedix Ltd, France), which is considered in many institutions to be the reference topical agent. The occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher was significantly lower (41% v 63%; P <.001) with the use of calendula than with trolamine. Moreover, patients receiving calendula had less frequent interruption of radiotherapy and significantly reduced radiation-induced pain. Calendula was considered to be more difficult to apply, but self-assessed satisfaction was greater. Body mass index and adjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy after lumpectomy were significant prognostic factors for acute dermatitis. Calendula is highly effective for the prevention of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher and should be proposed for patients undergoing postoperative irradiation for breast cancer.

Despite a lack of supporting evidence from prospective observational studies, occupational and leisure time physical activity are feared to be possible risk factors for lymphedema onset or exacerbation. We examined effects of supervised upper- and lower-body weight training on the incidence and symptoms of lymphedema in 45 breast cancer survivors who participated in the Weight Training for Breast Cancer Survivors study. This is the largest randomized controlled trial to examine associations between exercise and lymphedema in breast cancer survivors. The results of this study support the hypotheses that a 6-month intervention of resistance exercise did not increase the risk for or exacerbate symptoms of lymphedema. These results herald the need to start reevaluating common clinical guidelines that breast cancer survivors avoid upper body resistance activity for fear of increasing risk of lymphedema. None of the intervention-group participants experienced a change in arm circumferences > or = 2.0 cm after a 6-month exercise intervention. Self-reported incidence of a clinical diagnosis of lymphedema or symptom changes over 6 months did not vary by intervention status (P = .40 and P = .22, respectively). Participants were on average 52 years old, 4 to 36 months post-treatment, and had axillary dissection as part of their treatment. Thirteen women had prevalent lymphedema at baseline. The intervention was twice-a-week weight training over a period of 6 months.

We applied a similar intervention with a few modifications in a randomized controlled trial among Danish patients with malignant melanoma and evaluated results on immediate and long-term effects on psychological distress and coping capacity. The patients in the intervention group showed significantly less fatigue, greater vigor, and lower total mood disturbance compared with the controls, and they used significantly more active-behavioral and active-cognitive coping than the patients in the control group. The improvements were only significant at first follow-up. The findings of this study support the results of an earlier intervention study among patients with malignant melanoma and indicate that a psychoeducational group intervention for such patients can decrease psychological distress and enhance effective coping. However, this effect is short term and the clinical relevance is not obvious. A total of 262 patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma were randomly assigned to the control or intervention group. Patients in the intervention group were offered six weekly sessions of 2 hours of psychoeducation, consisting of health education, enhancement of problem-solving skills, stress management, and psychological support.

The eight 90-minute sessions addressed the five domains of QOL including cognitive, physical, emotional, spiritual, and social functioning. The primary end point of maintaining overall QOL was assessed by a single-item linear analog scale (Linear Analog Scale of Assessment or modified Spitzer Uniscale). QOL was assessed at baseline, week 4 (end of multidisciplinary intervention), week 8, and week 27. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a structured, multidisciplinary intervention targeted to maintain the overall quality of life (QOL), which is more comprehensive than psychosocial distress, of patients undergoing radiation therapy for advanced-stage cancer. Although intervention participants maintained and actually improved their QOL during radiation therapy, control participants experienced a significant decrease in their QOL. Thus, a structured multidisciplinary intervention can help maintain or even improve QOL in patients with advanced cancer who are undergoing cancer treatment. Of the 103 participants, overall QOL at week 4 was maintained by the patients in the intervention (n = 49), whereas QOL at week 4 significantly decreased for patients in the control group (n = 54). This change reflected a 3-point increase from baseline in the intervention group and a 9-point decrease from baseline in the control group (P = .009). Intervention participants maintained their QOL, and controls gradually returned to baseline by the end of the 6-month follow-up period.

Methods A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of an 8-week group intervention in women after BC treatment. The manual-based intervention combined two powerful ingredients: expressive guided-imagery exercises integrated within a model of group-therapy principles. The intervention facilitates exploration of identity, the development of new self-schemas, and personal growth. In addition, the intervention included an educational component on the social and cultural factors affecting women's self-esteem and BI. The control condition included standard care plus educational reading materials. One hundred ninety-four BC survivors who had expressed concerns about negative BI and/or difficulties with sexual functioning participated in the study; 131 were randomly assigned to the intervention, and 63 were assigned to the control condition. Participants were followed for 1 year. Results Women in the intervention group reported significantly less concern/distress about body appearance ( P < .01), decreased body stigma ( P < .01), and lower level of BC-related concerns ( P < .01), compared with women in the control group. BC-related quality of life was also better in the intervention group compared with the control group at the 1-year follow-up ( P < .01). There was no statistically significant group difference in sexual functioning. Conclusion Restoring Body Image After Cancer (ReBIC), a group intervention using guided imagery within a group-therapy approach, is an effective method for addressing BI-related concerns and quality of life post-BC. The manual-based intervention can be easily adapted to both cancer centers and primary care settings. Body Image Breast Neoplasms Female Humans Middle Aged Quality of Life Sexual Behavior",1

Internet interventions help patients overcome many barriers to seeking face-to-face support and may thus close this gap. We assessed feasibility and efficacy of Web-based stress management (STREAM [Stress-Aktiv-Mindern]) for newly diagnosed patients with cancer. Patients and Methods In a randomized controlled trial, patients with cancer who had started first-line treatment within the previous 12 weeks were randomly assigned to a therapist-guided Web-based intervention or a wait-list (control), stratified according to distress level (≥ 5 v < 5 on scale of 0 to 10). Primary efficacy end point was quality of life after the intervention (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue). Secondary end points included distress (Distress Thermometer) and anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Treatment effect was assessed with analyses of covariance, adjusted for baseline distress. Results A total of 222 of 229 screened patients applied online for participation. Between September 2014 and November 2016, 129 newly diagnosed patients with cancer, including 92 women treated for breast cancer, were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 65) or control (n = 64) group. Adherence was good, with 80.0% of patients using ≥ six of eight modules. Psychologists spent 13.3 minutes per week (interquartile range, 9.5-17.9 minutes per week) per patient for online guidance. After the intervention, quality of life was significantly higher (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue: mean, 8.59 points; 95% CI, 2.45 to 14.73 points; P = .007) and distress significantly lower (Distress Thermometer: mean, -0.85; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.10; P = .03) in the intervention group as compared with the control. Changes in anxiety or depression were not significant in the intention-to-treat population (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: mean, -1.28; 95% CI, -3.02 to 0.45; P = .15). Quality of life increased in the control group with the delayed intervention. Conclusion The Web-based stress management program STREAM is feasible and effective in improving quality of life.

My Changed Body (MyCB) is a Web-based psychological intervention to alleviate BID and improve body appreciation in survivors of breast cancer (BCSs) through a single-session, self-compassion focused writing activity. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of MyCB on BID and body appreciation in BCSs. The moderating effect of lymphedema status (affected or unaffected) and appearance investment (self-importance placed on personal appearance) and the mediating effect of self-compassion were evaluated. Patients and Methods Women (disease-free stage I to III BCSs who had experienced at least one negative event related to bodily changes after breast cancer) were randomly assigned to MyCB (n = 149) or an expressive writing control arm (n = 155). Primary outcomes were reduction in BID and improvement in body appreciation 1 week after intervention. Secondary outcomes included psychological distress (depression and anxiety) and self-compassion. Follow-up assessments occurred 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after writing. Results Compliance with the MyCB intervention was 88%, and attrition was 9.2%. Intent-to-treat linear mixed models indicated that participants who received MyCB reported significantly less BID ( P = .035) and greater body appreciation ( P = .004) and self-compassion ( P < .001) than expressive writing participants. Intervention effects on BID were moderated by lymphedema status ( P = .007) and appearance investment ( P = .042). Self-compassion mediated effects on both primary outcomes. Therapeutic effects were maintained at 1 month (BID and body appreciation) and 3 months (body appreciation) after intervention. Significant reductions in psychological distress (1-month depression, P = .001; 1-week and 1-month anxiety, P = .007) were evident for MyCB participants with lymphedema.

354,114653,Randomized Controlled Trial of Shared Care for Patients With Cancer Involving General Practitioners and Cancer Specialists.,Journal of oncology practice,25758448,"Ninety-seven eligible participants were randomly allocated, less than half the intended recruitment. There were no significant differences between the groups for empowerment, symptom prevalence, or Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scores. The proportion with clinical anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety score of ≥ 11) decreased over time in both groups (P = .013) but decreased more in the intervention group (P = .002). Depression was unchanged over time. Our study was limited by low recruitment and predominance of patients with breast cancer, and was underpowered for the main analyses. Results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Little benefit was seen for SCM in the majority of domains including empowerment, symptom prevalence, and psychological adjustment to cancer. The SCM showed efficacy in clinically anxious patients. Such interventions may be better implemented by using a targeted approach to identify at-need subgroups. People receiving chemotherapy for hematologic, breast, ovarian, or colorectal malignancies at two cancer centers were randomly assigned to receive SCM or standard care. The SCM involved a patient-held record, a project coordinator, routine contact between the patient and general practitioner/primary care physician, and primary care physician education. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer, and an empowerment questionnaire before, in the middle of, and on completion of chemotherapy. The presence and severity of adverse effects of chemotherapy were recorded by patients in a symptom diary. We aimed to determine whether a shared care model (SCM) during chemotherapy treatment improved emotional well-being, empowerment, and prevalence of symptoms for people being treated for cancer.

355,114705,Consumption of green tea causes rapid increase in plasma antioxidant power in humans.,Nutrition and cancer,10453446,"Green tea contains polyphenolic antioxidants that have shown anticarcinogenic properties in animal and in vitro experimental studies. Current data regarding absorption and bioavailability of tea antioxidants in humans, however, are conflicting. In this study, plasma and urine antioxidant power after ingestion of green tea was measured using the ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assay (US patent pending) to assess absorption, systemic distribution, and renal excretion of green tea antioxidants in healthy adults. Results showed that absorption of green tea antioxidants was rapid, with peak increase in plasma FRAP of around 4% at 40 minutes after ingestion: mean increase was 44 +/- 9 (SE) mumol/l. Excretion of polyphenolic antioxidants was also fast, peaking at 60-90 minutes, with significant correlation between urinary FRAP values and urinary total phenolic concentrations (r = 0.845, p < 0.001). In control studies, no increase in plasma or urine FRAP values was seen after intake of water. Although the amount of antioxidants absorbed was relatively small and the increase in plasma antioxidant power was of short duration, results demonstrate that some potentially anticarcinogenic polyphenolic antioxidants in green tea enter the systemic circulation soon after ingestion and cause a significant increase in plasma antioxidant status. This increase may, in turn, lower oxidative damage to DNA and so decrease risk of cancer.

356,114706,Effects of soy intake on sex hormone metabolism in premenopausal women.,Nutrition and cancer,10578479,"Studies suggest that phytoestrogens in soy products may impart hormonal effects that protect women against breast cancer. Limited research suggests that intake of soy products high in isoflavonoid phytoestrogens affects sex hormone metabolism, but it is unknown whether phytoestrogens in soy have any effect on menstrual function or serum sex hormones in women on common hormone therapies, such as oral contraceptives (OC). We studied the effects of soy in 36 premenopausal women, 20 of whom used OC. Subjects consumed their normal diet for two menstrual cycles and added a soy beverage containing 20 g of protein and 38 mg of total isoflavones to their usual diet for another two menstrual cycles. No significant differences were observed in serum estrone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, prolactin, or progesterone concentrations with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. No changes in menstrual cycle length or the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone were seen with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group. Levels of urinary estrogen metabolites were significantly different between the non-OC and the OC group. Thus soy consumption had no significant effect on the menstrual cycle, serum sex hormones, or urinary estrogen metabolite ratio in premenopausal OC or non-OC users.

With the use of standard methods, FFQ estimates for women on the low-fat diet were significantly correlated to records only for percent calories from fat (r = 0.39), whereas recall and record estimates were significantly correlated for all three dietary variables. Using the new method, we found no significant correlation between FFQ and either recalls or records for women following a low-fat diet but significant correlation between recall and record estimates for total calories (r = 0.67). Traditional correlation testing may overestimate the extent of agreement in dietary instruments among women on a low-fat diet. We found empirical support for the nontraditional method.

This study was designed to assess the independent effect of soy relative to animal protein and soy-derived isoflavones on circulating estrogen and androgen concentrations in postmenopausal women and older men. Forty-two subjects (> 50 yr) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of > or = 3.36 mmol/l were fed each of 4 diets in randomized order for 6 wk/phase. All food and drink were provided. Diets contained 25 g soy or common sources of animal protein/4.2 MJ containing trace or 50 mg isoflavones/4.2 MJ. At the end of each diet phase, concentrations of estrone sulfate, estrone, estradiol, testosterone, androstendione, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were measured. In postmenopausal women, concentrations of estrone were higher and its precursor, dehydroepiandrosterone, lower after consuming the soy compared with animal protein diets (P = 0.0396 and 0.0374, respectively). There was no significant effect of isoflavones on any of the hormones measured. In older men, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations were lower after consuming the isoflavone (P = 0.0106) and higher after soy, compared with the animal protein diets (P = 0.0118). These data suggest that relatively large amounts of soy protein or soy-derived isoflavones had modest and limited sex-specific effects on circulating hormone levels.

In a randomized placebo-controlled trial we studied the effects of isoflavonoids on urinary output of the N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen, pyridinoline (Pyr), and deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr) (bone resorption markers) and serum levels of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and N-terminal and C-terminal procollagen type I (bone formation markers). Fifty-five postmenopausal women with a history of breast cancer used phytoestrogens (114 mg of isoflavonoids) or placebo tablets daily for 3 months; the treatment regimens were then crossed over after a 2-month washout period. The markers were measured before and on the last day of each treatment period. Bone resorption was reduced during phytoestrogen use, as reflected in falls in the urinary output of Pyr (9%; P = 0.001) and Dpyr (5%; P = 0.008). Compared with the placebo group, the fall in Dpyr was significant (P = 0.022) and the falls in Pyr (P = 0.084) and N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (P = 0.082) showed a trend toward significance. Bone formation markers were not affected by this regimen. Thus, isoflavonoid-induced inhibition of bone resorption may contribute to the low risk of osteoporosis in Asian women.

There were no significant differences between groups. Telephone intervention was not possible in a quarter of women whose numbers were unlisted. Telephone intervention was the most expensive and least effective of the interventions. The commissioner letter yielded an additional attender within three months at an incremental cost of 23.21 pounds compared with taking no action. Randomized controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis. In all, 1140 women were identified from routine NHS screening records as having no smear for at least 15 years and randomly allocated to receive a telephone call from a nurse, a letter from a well-known celebrity (Claire Rayner) or letter from the local NHS Cervical Screening Commissioner. Uptake of screening was measured using routine data and attributed to interventions if occurring within three months. Uptake was compared with a control group. Costs of carrying out the interventions were noted from the perspective of the NHS and cost-effectiveness, as cost per additional attender, calculated. To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three methods of inviting women with a long history of non-attendance to undergo cervical screening. Neither a telephone call from a nurse nor a letter from a celebrity to encourage attendance for cervical screening were effective or cost-effective in women with a prolonged history of non-participation in the screening programme. A letter from the local cervical screening programme commissioner resulted in a small, non-significant increase in uptake. The low cost and ease of implementation of this intervention supports further research into its use in routine practice.

In this prospective study, the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture therapy in relieving CRCI and its impact on serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighty patients were randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group with 40 patients in each group. The treatment group was treated at the following acupuncture points: Baihui (DU20), Sishencong (EX-HN1), Shenting (DU24), Zusanli (ST36), Taixi (K13), Dazhong (K14), and Juegu (GB39). Cognitive function was assessed using the functional assessment of cancer treatment cognition test (FACT-COG, version 3), the auditory-verbal learning test (AVLT), the verbal fluency test (VFT), the symbol digit modality test (SDMT), the clock-drawing test (CDT), and the trail-making test part B (TMT-B). In addition, blood serum levels of BDNF were measured before and after treatment. Correlations between change in BDNF levels and cognitive function were also analyzed. RESULTS CRCI was ameliorated in the acupuncture treatment group, with scores on FACT-COG, AVLT-recognition and CDT assessments all significantly increased (P<0.05 in all cases). In addition, serum BDNF levels after acupuncture treatment were significantly higher than before treatment ([i]t[/i]=3.242, [i]P[/i]<0.01). Moreover, the level of BDNF was positively correlated with the total score of FACT-COG, AVLT-recognition, and CDT ([i]r[/i]=0.694, 0.628, and 0.532, respectively; all P<0.05). The control group showed no statistically significant difference in any measures over the same period. CONCLUSIONS Acupuncture therapy is effective in the treatment of CRCI in breast cancer patients through a mechanism that may be related to an increase of BDNF.

This randomized controlled study compared a Web-based and a paper-based decision aid with no previsit education. Men aged 50 to 70 years undergoing a health maintenance examination at a large family practice were enrolled. The primary outcome was patient-reported level of control over the decision to be screened. Secondary outcomes included frequency of screening, patient knowledge, decisional conflict, and time spent discussing screening. A total of 497 men participated (75 control, 196 brochure, 226 Web site). Patients exposed to either aid were no more likely than control patients to report a collaborative decision: 36% of patients in each group reported equally sharing decision responsibility. Exposure to either decision aid increased patients' involvement in decision making compared with the control condition (Web site, P = .03; brochure, P = .03). Only 46% of control patients reported an active decision-making role, compared with 56% of Web site and 54% of brochure patients.

377,123335,The impact of psychosocial intervention on survival in cancer: a meta-analysis.,Annals of palliative medicine,27121737,"Of 5,080 identified articles, thirteen trials were included for analysis. There was a significant survival benefit for the intervention group at one year [risk ratio (RR) =0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.67-1.00; P=0.04] and two years (RR =0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95; P=0.003). However, no significant difference was detected at four years (RR =0.94; 95% CI, 0.85-1.04; P=0.24). Among patients with breast cancer, there was a significant survival benefit of psychosocial interventions at one year (RR =0.59; 95% CI, 0.42-0.82; P=0.002), but no difference at two years (RR =0.82; 95% CI, 0.67-1.02; P=0.07) or four years (RR =0.95; 95% CI, 0.73-1.23; P=0.68).

Individually-delivered interventions had no significant survival benefit at one year (RR =0.92; 95% CI, 0.79-1.08; P=0.32), two years (RR =0.87; 95% CI, 0.75-1.00; P=0.05), or four years (RR =0.93; 95% CI, 0.84-1.04; P=0.21). For the main analysis and group-delivered treatments, psychosocial interventions demonstrated only short-term improvements in survival. Individually-delivered interventions failed to show any survival benefit. Future studies with longer follow-up are warranted to investigate long-term survival outcomes. The impact of psychosocial interventions on survival remains controversial in patients with cancer. A meta-analysis of the recent literature was conducted to evaluate the potential survival benefit associated with psychosocial interventions for cancer patients. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central were searched from January 2004 to May 2015 for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared survival outcomes between cancer patients receiving a psychosocial intervention and those receiving other, or no interventions. Endpoints included one-, two-, and four-year overall survival. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare group-versus individually-delivered interventions, and to assess breast cancer-only trials.

The eligible chemotherapy regimens included docetaxel+cyclophosphamide (TC), doxorubicin+cyclophosphamide (AC) and paclitaxel (P) weekly+trastuzumab (T). 24 pts (89%) completed the treatment; 3 pts (11%) treated with AC prematurely interrupted use of the scalp-cooling device due to inefficacy. After the last cycle of chemotherapy, the number of patient who perceived a HL < grade 2 was 16 (59%). The hair retention reported by operators has been higher (78%). 81.5% of patients well tolerated the treatment. In our study, the scalp-cooling device reduced chemotherapy-induced alopecia in taxane- based chemotherapy. Furthermore, it suggests a discordance in hair loss perception between patients and operators. The most effective agents in the treatment of breast cancer have a common side effect, the hair loss. Some studies reported a reduction of hair loss with the use of the scalp cooling device. Indeed, it decreases the drug accumulation in the hair follicles. We report our preliminary experience with a scalp cooling device in reducing chemotherapy-induced alopecia and related distress in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. Hair loss grading and treatment tolerability were evaluated during chemotherapy every 21 days and 3 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy via Dean's scale by patients and operators and a comfort analogic scale by patients.

increasing physical activity decreases the risk of having breast cancer. Finding ways to early initiate and maintain such
behavior among youth is therefore important. In this study we aimed to determine the effects of two health promotion
education interventions on knowledge and attitude to breast care, as well as practice of BSE and physical activity by
female college students. Materials and Methods: A total of 999 students from ten colleges underwent two kinds of
health education strategies for three months, namely the traditional health education program (THEP) and tapping peer
leaders using mobile phone prompts (PPHEP). Results: Improvement in knowledge and attitude was shown for both
groups as compared to the control group. Both interventions equally increased the practice of BSE and maintenance of
the recommended level of physical activity. Conclusion: There was an increase in the knowledge and positive attitude
to breast care and practice of BSE with an improvement in the level of exercise when THEP and PPHEP interventions
were used. Health education with peers using mobile phone prompts offers an alternative and effective way of promoting
BSE and acceptable levels of exercise. Adult Breast Neoplasms Breast Self-Examination Case-Control Studies Cell Phone Female Follow-Up Studies Health Education Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice Health Promotion Humans Middle Aged Peer Group Prognosis Students Universities",1

Patients were discharged into ambulatory care the day after the last chemotherapy administration and were subsequently seen at the ambulatory care unit three times a week. One hundred and one of 224 patients were ineligible for the program, mostly because of their medical situation, the lack of a caregiver or the travel time to the hospital. The remaining 123 patients were able to spend more than 70% of the time at home. In 44% of cycles they were never readmitted.

Advanced biliary tract carcinoma has a very poor prognosis with all current available modalities of treatment. In this pilot open-label study, the authors investigated the efficacy and safety of a combination of dimethyl sulfoxide-sodium bicarbonate (DMSO-SB) infusion and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (ademetionine) oral supplementation as palliative pharmacotherapy in nine patients with advanced nonresectable biliary tract carcinomas (ABTCs). Patients with evidence of biliary obstruction with a total serum bilirubin ≤300 μmol/L were allowed to join the study. The results of this 6-month study and follow-up of all nine patients with ABTC indicated that the investigated combination treatment improved pain control, blood biochemical parameters, and quality of life for the patients. Moreover, this method of treatment has led to a 6-month progression-free survival for all investigated patients. The treatment was well tolerated for all patients without major adverse reactions. Given that ABTC is a highly fatal malignancy with poor response to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, the authors consider that the combination of DMSO-SB and ademetionine deserves further research and application as a palliative care and survival-enhancing treatment for this group of patients.

Approaching patients who have CRC is an opportunity to increase the participation of their first-degree relatives in screening colonoscopy. The frequency of neoplasia that was found in this study underscores the need to screen relatives even before they reach the usual age threshold for screening. Screening colonoscopy can lower the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet participation rates are low even in groups at high risk. The goal of this study was to double the rate of participation in screening colonoscopy among persons at familial risk and then to determine the frequency of neoplasia in this risk group. In a nationwide, cluster-randomized, multicenter study, first-degree relatives (FDR) of patients with CRC across Germany received written informational materials concerning the familial risk of CRC, along with an invitation to undergo colonoscopy. Participants in the intervention group were additionally counseled by nurses over the telephone. The primary endpoint of the study was colonoscopy uptake within 30 days. The participants' mean age was 50.8 years. The colonoscopy uptake rates were 99/125 (79%) in the intervention group and 97/136 (71%) in the control group (RR = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [0.97; 1.28]).

Participants were randomly assigned to either a mindfulness group or a mindlessness group and completed the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA) as a measure of caregivers' feelings before the intervention. Subsequently, both groups were given four sessions of mindfulness training using ""innovation classification"". Finally, participants completed the Langer Mindfulness Scale (LMS) and the Positive Aspects of Caregiving (PAC) scale as post-intervention measures. The results revealed that participants in the mindfulness and mindlessness groups differed significantly in LMS and PAC scores, with the mindfulness group having higher levels of positive feelings than those in the mindlessness group. The results also indicated that mindfulness level significantly predicted positive feelings of caregivers.

Women, regardless of age, who received the experimental intervention reported less fear about sex after cancer treatment. The older women who received the experimental intervention gained more sexual knowledge. There was no evidence that the experimental intervention improved global sexual health. Thirty-two women with Stage I or II cervical or endometrial carcinoma who were being treated with radiotherapy were randomized and received either the experimental group program or the control intervention that consisted of written information and brief counseling. Outcome measures included global sexual health, knowledge about sexuality and cancer, fears about sexuality after cancer, and vaginal dilation compliance. The association between radiotherapy for gynecological carcinoma and sexual dysfunction is well established. Regular vaginal dilation is widely recommended to these women as a way for them to maintain vaginal health and good sexual functioning. However, the compliance rate with this recommendation is low. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a group psychoeducational program based on the ""information-motivation-behavioral skills"" model of behavior change in increasing the rate of compliance. This is the first controlled study to provide evidence of an intervention's effectiveness 1. in increasing women's vaginal dilation following radiotherapy for gynecological carcinoma and 2. in reducing their fears about sex after cancer.

Many studies in this area to date have not included sufficient measurement points to identify fluctuations in psychosocial status over time. In addition, many have used caregiver health as an outcome rather than a predictor. People who are caregivers for cancer patients and have physical problems of their own are at risk for psychologic morbidity, which may have a delayed onset. This delay may reflect the replacement of an initial optimism with discouragement as the reality of long-term illness sets in. Home care may create a situation in which caregivers are required to confront the realities of long-term caregiving quickly, cutting short their initial optimism, but also preparing them for what is to come.

We were interested in whether there were differences in lung cancer susceptibility to smoking within the GSTM1 genotypes and the impact of antioxidant supplementation on this. For this purpose, we conducted a nested lung cancer case-control study and evaluated the role of GSTM1 within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. GSTM1 genotype status was determined for 319 cases and 333 controls using a PCR-based approach. GSTM1 was evaluated as an independent risk factor and as an effect modifier of smoking using logistic regression analyses. The GSTM1 null genotype itself was unrelated to risk of lung cancer, odds ratio (OR) = 1.09 and 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79-1.50, but it may have modified the effect of smoking. There was a suggestion for a stronger association between years of smoking and lung cancer among the GSTM1 null genotype, but the differences between GSTM1 null and present genotypes were not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Furthermore, the smoking association was strongest among those with the GSTM1 null genotype not receiving alpha-tocopherol supplementation, whereas among those receiving alpha-tocopherol, there was no modification by GSTM1 on the association between smoking duration and lung cancer risk. Beta-carotene supplementation did not modify the relationship between GSTM1, smoking years, and lung cancer risk. In conclusion, GSTM1 is not associated with lung cancer risk in male smokers but may confer a higher susceptibility to cumulative tobacco exposure. This association may be attenuated by alpha-tocopherol but not by beta-carotene supplementation.

This study evaluated the effect of nonpharmacological sleep treatments on patient-reported sleep quality, pain, and well-being in people with long-term cancer and non-cancer (e.g., back pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia) pain conditions. PROSPERO registration: CRD42013004131. Means and standard deviations of sleep quality, pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, physical and psychological functioning were extracted for the sleep treatment and control groups at baseline, posttreatment and final follow-up. Methodological details concerning the treatment, participants, and study design were abstracted to guide heterogeneity and subgroup analyses. Eleven RCTs involving 1,066 participants (mean age 45-61 years) met the criteria for the meta-analysis. There was no systematic evidence of publication bias. Nonpharmacological sleep treatments in chronic pain patients were associated with a large improvement in sleep quality (standardized mean difference = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval [0.42, 1.13]; P < 0.001), small reduction in pain (0.18 [0, 0.36] P < 0.05), and moderate improvement in fatigue (0.38 [0.08, 0.69]; P < 0.01) at posttreatment. The effects on sleep quality and fatigue were maintained at follow-up (up to 1 year) when a moderate reduction in depression (0.31, [0.09, 0.53]; P < 0.01) was also observed. Both cancer and non-cancer pain patients benefited from nonpharmacological sleep treatments. Face-to-face treatments achieved better outcomes than those delivered over the phone/internet. Although the body of evidence was small, nonpharmacological sleep interventions may represent a fruitful avenue for optimizing treatment outcomes in patients with chronic pain. We systematically searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO for relevant studies. Search period was set to inception of these databases to March 2014. Studies were included if they were: original randomized controlled trials (RCTs); testing a nonpharmacological intervention; that targets sleep; in adults; with painful health conditions; that has a control group; includes a measure of sleep quality; and at least one other health and well-being outcome.

The level of malnutrition risk (T0 vs. T3) was 47.6% vs. 4.8% in the experimental group and 35.7% vs. 42.9 in the control group. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) statistics were used to assess the effects of the dietary education program on nutritional status. Quality of life was found to be significantly better in the experimental group than in the control group (p < .001). A quasi-experimental design was conducted. Eligible patients were enrolled immediately after they could sip water after surgery. The participants were randomized into the experimental group (n = 42) and the control group (n = 42). Both groups were provided guidance for swallowing exercise and performed a pre-test (T0) and three post-tests (T1-T3) for a total of three months.

Three quality indicators (medication compliance, knowledge of disease, and ability for self-care); extent of use of services; degree of patient satisfaction as reported on a 3-part scale; and direct and indirect costs of using the remote video technology. Level of acuity and number of referrals for home health care have been escalating exponentially. As referrals continue to increase, health care organizations are encouraged to find more effective methods for providing high-quality patient care with cost savings. Remote video technology in the home health care setting was shown to be effective, well received by patients, capable of maintaining quality of care, and to have the potential for cost savings. Patients seemed pleased with the equipment and the ability to access a home health care provider 24 hours a day. Remote technology has the potential to effect cost savings when used to substitute some in-person visits and can also improve access to home health care staff for patients and caregivers. This technology can thus be an asset for patients and providers. Newly referred patients diagnosed as having congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral vascular accident, cancer, diabetes, anxiety, or need for wound care were eligible for random assignment to intervention (n = 102) or control (n = 110) groups. No differences in the quality indicators, patient satisfaction, or use were seen.

To test the effect of an educational video, mailed to patients' homes before a physical examination, on performance of colorectal cancer screening, particularly sigmoidoscopy. Randomized, controlled trial. 5 primary care practices in central Massachusetts. 938 patients age 50 to 74 years who were scheduled for an upcoming physical examination, had no personal history of colorectal cancer, and were eligible for lower-endoscopy screening according to current guidelines. Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care (n = 488) or a video about colorectal cancer, the importance of early detection, and screening options (n = 450). Baseline and 6-month follow-up telephone assessments were conducted. A dependent variable classified screening since baseline as 1) sigmoidoscopy with or without other tests, 2) another test or test combination, or 3) no tests. Overall screening rates were the same in the intervention and control groups (55%). In regression modeling, intervention participants were nonsignificantly more likely to complete sigmoidoscopy alone or in combination with another test (odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.70]). Intervention dose (viewing at least half of the video) was significantly related to receiving sigmoidoscopy with or without another test (odds ratio, 2.81 [CI, 1.85 to 4.26]). Recruitment records showed that at least 23% of people coming for periodic health assessments were currently screened by a lower-endoscopy procedure and therefore were not eligible. The primary care sample studied consisted primarily of middle-class white persons who had high screening rates at baseline. The results may not be generalizable to other populations. The trial was conducted during a period of increased health insurance coverage for lower-endoscopy procedures and public media attention to colon cancer screening.

In the NG, the nurse contacted the patient by phone every 6 months unless the patient himself initiated the contact. Patient satisfaction was evaluated twice a year via questionnaire. The questionnaire included the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The costs of all medical interventions and adverse events related to prostate cancer were calculated for all patients. Our study indicates that men with prostate cancer can be safely followed up by a specialist nurse. The study results show that this alternative follow-up is cost-effective, especially in men without metastases. The effectiveness of traditional follow-up programs and the intensive search for disease progression in men with prostate cancer have been questioned. The aims of this randomized multi-centre study were to evaluate medical safety, patient satisfaction and resource utilization in an on-demand follow-up by a specialist nurse compared with traditional follow-up by a urologist. Medical safety, measured as complication frequency and lag time from symptoms to intervention, during the first 3 years of the observation period, was similar in the NG and the UG. The total number of interventions due to symptoms from prostate cancer was also similar in both groups. The analysis of accessibility and the HAD scale showed no significant differences between the groups.

Patients were sequentially assigned to either a usual care control group or the experimental group, which completed a computerized version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire in order to provide the clinic staff with QL information prior to the clinic appointment. The control group completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 paper version after the clinic appointment. Outcome measures were patient satisfaction, the degree to which issues identified on the QL questionnaire were addressed in the appointment, and a chart audit, which measured charting of QL issues and actions taken by the clincian relating to QL. In the experimental group, more QL issues identified by the patient on the EORTC QLQ-C30 were addressed during the clinic appointment than in the control group. As well, marginally more categories were charted and a trend towards more actions being taken was seen in the experimental group. Patients reported being equally and highly satisfied with the treatment in both groups. The clinical implication is that the computerized administration of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and providing staff with a report highlighting patient-specific QL deficits is a simple, time-effective and acceptable means of improving patient-provider communication in a busy outpatient clinic.

Because no regular coordinating centre or person exists, coordination of care may be deficient leading to a poor continuity of care. This may be particularly true for those patients being cared for by both primary and hospital care teams, as is the case for most terminal cancer patients. Therefore, a transmural home care intervention programme for terminal cancer patients was introduced which intended to optimize coordination of care and thereby improve continuity of care. This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of this intervention (intervention group 79 patients) on indicators of coordination and continuity of care. When compared to standard care (control group 37 patients) moderate positive effects (mainly for the nursing disciplines) on the various indicators of coordination and continuity of care by the transmural home care intervention programme were found.

Diets were isoenergetic, with either 150 g lean meat or 290 g tofu daily providing an equivalent amount of macronutrients, with only the source of protein differing between the two diets. Each diet lasted for 4 weeks, with a 2-week interval between interventions. Fasting blood samples were taken between 07.00 and 09.30 hours. Urinary excretion of genistein and daidzein was significantly higher after the tofu diet (P < 0.001). Blood concentrations of sex hormones did not differ after the two diets, but the mean testosterone:oestradiol value was 10% higher (P = 0.06) after the meat diet. SHBG was 3% higher (P = 0.07), whereas the FAI was 7% lower (P = 0.06), after the tofu diet compared with the meat diet. There was a significant correlation between the difference in SHBG and testosterone:oestradiol and weight change. Adjusting for weight change revealed SHBG to be 8.8% higher on the tofu diet (mean difference 3 (95% CI 0.7, 5.2) nmol/l; P = 0.01) and testosterone:oestradiol to be significantly lower, P = 0.049). Thus, replacement of meat protein with soyabean protein, as tofu, may have a minor effect on biologically-active sex hormones, which could influence prostate cancer risk. However, other factors or mechanisms may also be responsible for the different incidence rates in men on different diets.

In this study of patients with breast cancer receiving high-dose chemotherapy, adjunct electroacupuncture was more effective in controlling emesis than minimal needling or antiemetic pharmacotherapy alone, although the observed effect had limited duration. JAMA. 2000;284:2755-2761. The number of emesis episodes occurring during the 5 days was lower for patients receiving electroacupuncture compared with those receiving minimal needling or pharmacotherapy alone (median number of episodes, 5, 10, and 15, respectively; P<.001). The electroacupuncture group had fewer episodes of emesis than the minimal needling group (P<.001), whereas the minimal needling group had fewer episodes of emesis than the antiemetic pharmacotherapy alone group (P =.01). The differences among groups were not significant during the 9-day follow-up period (P =.18). High-dose chemotherapy poses considerable challenges to emesis management. Although prior studies suggest that acupuncture may reduce nausea and emesis, it is unclear whether such benefit comes from the nonspecific effects of attention and clinician-patient interaction. Oncology center at a university medical center. One hundred four women (mean age, 46 years) with high-risk breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive low-frequency electroacupuncture at classic antiemetic acupuncture points once daily for 5 days (n = 37); minimal needling at control points with mock electrostimulation on the same schedule (n = 33); or no adjunct needling (n = 34).

This quasi-experimental study sought to determine if a specific nursing intervention program designed to enhance hope would positively influence levels of hope and quality-of-life (QOL) in a convenience sample of 115 people with a first recurrence of cancer who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: treatment group (hope), attention control group (informational), or control group (usual treatment). The Herth Hope Index (HHI) and the Cancer Rehabilitation and Evaluation Systems, Short Form (CARES-SF) were administered prior to intervention, immediately after intervention and at 3, 6, and 9-month intervals. Treatment and control groups differed significantly with regard to level of hope (P=0.02) and QOL (P=0.03). Both the level of hope and QOL were significantly increased (P=0.03) immediately after intervention and across time (3, 6 and 9 months). This study was a preliminary attempt to design, implement, and evaluate a theory-driven hope intervention program. Knowledge about the effectiveness of specific interventions designed to enhance hope is vital if nurses are to significantly influence hope in those whom are in their care.

Interventions to minimize fatigue are needed. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between exercise and fatigue over the first three cycles of chemotherapy in women receiving either cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) or doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) for breast cancer. Seventy-two newly diagnosed women with breast cancer were instructed in a home-based moderate-intensity exercise intervention. Measures of functional ability, energy expenditure, and fatigue were obtained at baseline and posttest. Subjects maintained daily records of four types of fatigue, and exercise duration, intensity, and type. The impact of exercise on fatigue was significant and suggests the effectiveness of a low- to moderate-intensity regular exercise program in maintaining functional ability and reducing fatigue in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Exercise significantly reduced all four levels of fatigue (P < 0.01). As the duration of exercise increased, the intensity of fatigue declined (P < 0.01). There was a significant carry-over effect of exercise on fatigue, but the effect lasted only 1 d.

Nurses made a total of nine contacts, five in person and four by telephone, over 16 weeks. Centers for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and a symptom inventory were used. Medical record audits were conducted retrospectively. Determine the impact of a 16-week supportive nursing intervention on caregivers of patients with newly diagnosed cancer. Nurses must be vigilant in monitoring caregivers for signs of depression and must intervene to provide emotional support and make appropriate referrals for follow-up care to promote positive outcomes for patients and caregivers. The intervention appeared to be more effective in slowing the rate of deterioration of depressive symptoms than in decreasing levels of depression in this sample of caregivers. Determining the effectiveness of this intervention in decreasing caregiver depression was difficult because caregivers with higher levels of depression were more likely to withdraw from the study. Baseline caregiver depression and the number of patient symptoms at baseline, 9, and 24 weeks were significant predictors of caregiver depression at 9 and 24 weeks. However, no main effect of the experimental condition existed on caregiver depression. At the final observation, a nonsignificant inverse relationship was found between the number of interventions and depression scores for caregivers.

This prospective comparative study was designed to determine the effectiveness of a preventive oral care protocol in reducing chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in children with cancer. During an 8-month period, 42 children aged 6 to 17 years with haematological malignancies or solid tumours were evaluated. The 21 children who were included in the first 4-month period of the study constituted the control group. Another 21 children were enrolled in the subsequent 4 months and were assigned to the experimental group, in which they were given an oral care protocol intervention. The oral care protocol consisted of tooth brushing, 0.2% chlorhexidine mouth rinse and 0.9% saline rinse. Children in both groups were evaluated twice a week for 3 weeks. The incidence of ulcerative lesions, severity of oral mucositis and the related pain intensity were used as the main outcome variables. A 38% reduction in the incidence of ulcerative mucositis was found in children using the oral care protocol compared with children in the control group. The severity of oral mucositis (P=0.000002) and the related pain (P=0.0001) were significantly reduced with the intervention. These results support the preventive use of the oral care protocol in paediatric cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy for cancer treatment.

423,139685,"Phase I clinical trial of curcumin, a chemopreventive agent, in patients with high-risk or pre-malignant lesions.",Anticancer research,11712783,"Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a yellow substance from the root of the plant Curcuma longa Linn., has been demonstrated to inhibit carcinogenesis of murine skin, stomach, intestine and liver. However, the toxicology, pharmacokinetics and biologically effective dose of curcumin in humans have not been reported. This prospective phase-I study evaluated these issues of curcumin in patients with one of the following five high-risk conditions: 1) recently resected urinary bladder cancer; 2) arsenic Bowen's disease of the skin; 3) uterine cervical intraepithelial neoplasm (CIN); 4) oral leucoplakia; and 5) intestinal metaplasia of the stomach. Curcumin was taken orally for 3 months. Biopsy of the lesion sites was done immediately before and 3 months after starting curcumin treament. The starting dose was 500 mg/day. If no toxicity > or = grade II was noted in at least 3 successive patients, the dose was then escalated to another level in the order of 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, 8,000, and 12,000 mg/day. The concentration of curcumin in serum and urine was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). A total of 25 patients were enrolled in this study. There was no treatment-related toxicity up to 8,000 mg/day. Beyond 8,000 mg/day, the bulky volume of the drug was unacceptable to the patients. The serum concentration of curcumin usually peaked at 1 to 2 hours after oral intake of crucumin and gradually declined within 12 hours. The average peak serum concentrations after taking 4,000 mg, 6,000 mg and 8,000 mg of curcumin were 0.51 +/- 0.11 microM, 0.63 +/- 0.06 microM and 1.77 +/- 1.87 microM, respectively. Urinary excretion of curcumin was undetectable. One of 4 patients with CIN and 1 of 7 patients with oral leucoplakia proceeded to develop frank malignancies in spite of curcumin treatment. In contrast, histologic improvement of precancerous lesions was seen in 1 out of 2 patients with recently resected bladder cancer, 2 out of 7 patients of oral leucoplakia, 1 out of 6 patients of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, I out of 4 patients with CIN and 2 out of 6 patients with Bowen's disease. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that curcumin is not toxic to humans up to 8,000 mg/day when taken by mouth for 3 months.

424,139805,Normalization of elevated hepatic 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in chronic hepatitis C patients by phlebotomy and low iron diet.,Cancer research,11751387,"Accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in DNA, which may result from the continuous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation associated with chronic inflammation, has been reported in various human preneoplastic lesions and in cancerous tissues. However, no direct causative relationship between the 8-OHdG formation and carcinogenesis has been thus far demonstrated in humans. Directly proving the causality requires showing that depletion of 8-OHdG levels in tissue by interfering with ROS generation results in a reduction in cancer. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with a high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several studies on patients with chronic HCV have shown that hepatic iron overload is attributable to liver injury and that iron depletion improved serum aminotransferase levels. Excess iron is known to generate ROS within cells, which causes mutagenic lesions, such as 8-OHdG. In this study, therefore, we have evaluated whether therapeutic iron reduction (phlebotomy and low iron diet) with a long-term follow-up (6 years) would decrease the hepatic 8-OHdG levels and the risk of HCC development in patients with chronic HCV. Patients (34) enrolled were those who had undergone standard IFN therapy but had no sustained response. Quantitative immunohistochemistry using the KS-400 image analyzing system and electrochemical detection was used for 8-OHdG detection. With this treatment, elevated hepatic 8-OHdG levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C (8.3 +/- 4.6/10(5) dG) significantly decreased to almost normal levels (2.2 +/- 0.9/10(5) dG; P < 0.001) with concomitant improvement of hepatitis severity, including fibrosis, whereas HCV titers were unaffected. None of these patients developed HCC. Thus, long-term iron reduction therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C may potentially lower the risk of progression to HCC.

Cancer & chemotherapy,11890101,"DGT trail did not show apparent difference between the treatment and placebo group in alleviating the esophageal precancerous lesions and abnormal cell proliferation. For the calcium intervention study, after 11 years' follow-up, 10 subjects had developed into cancers in the calcium group (10%, 8 EC and 2 GCA), and 8 subjects developed into EC in the placebo group (8%). All these patients were diagnosed at very early stage of cancer (symptom-free). Of the 578 subjects, 25 (18 males and 7 females) had developed into EC (n = 23, 4.3%) and gastric cardia cancer (GCA, n = 2, 0.3%), during the 11 years' follow-up. The mean time of cancer development (from entry of the follow-up study to the cancer detection) was 5.0 +/- 2.9 years (males) and 4.7 +/- 3.2 years (females). Of the 25 patients with EC and GCA, 11 were from the 387 followed subjects with ""normal"" histomorphology of biopsy at the entry of the follow-up study (3%, 11/387), 2 were from the subjects with basal cell hyperplasia, grade I (BCH I, 2%, 2/94), 7 from the subjects with BCH grade II (BCH II, 10%, 7/72), and 5 from BCH III and dysplasia (20%, 5/25). Follow-up studies with linear repeated biopsies and histopathological examination were performed on 778 subjects from Linzhou and Huixian. Of these subjects, 578 subjects were followed for 11 years (1989-2000), 400 subjects with different severity of esophageal precancerous lesions were randomly divided into 2 groups for intervention studies with calcium and decaffeinated green tea (DGT). Each group included 200 subjects (100 subjects for treatment, and 100 subjects for placebo). In calcium group, each subject received an oral supplementation of 1,200 mg of calcium daily for 11 months. In DGT group, each subject received 5 mg of DGT daily for 12 months. In placebo group, each subject received placebo pill for 11 months (calcium group) and 12 month (DGT group). At the entry and the end of the trial, esophageal biopsy specimens were taken at the middle and the lower thirds of the esophagus and from macroscopic lesions, if only, of each subject. Esophageal cancer (EC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Linzhou (formerly Linxian) and Huixian of Henan province, northern China, which has been well recognized as the highest incidence area for EC. The lack of useful chemoprevention agents and early detection methods is the key factors for stable EC incidence in these areas. Human esophageal carcinogensis has been considered as a multistep progressive process. The natural history for EC, however is not very clear. DGT trail was not shown to have beneficial effects in alleviating esophageal precancerous lesions and abnormal cell proliferation patterns. Calcium supplementation did not produce apparent long-term effects on EC. BCH II could be considered as precancerous lesions of EC. The quantitative histopathological analysis in terms of number of proliferating basal cell layers is of importance in determining the high-risk subjects for EC and evaluating the intervention results. Follow-up studies with repeated endoscopic biopsies are the powerful strategy for early detection and mortality control of EC and GAC in the high incidence area.

Weight change, body mass index, anorexia, nausea, fatigue, caloric expenditure during exercise, and functional ability were recorded. Women who adhered to the exercise program maintained their body weight, while nonexercisers steadily gained weight (P < .05). There were no differences in incidence or intensity of nausea or anorexia between the exercisers and nonexercisers. Women who exercised over the four cycles of chemotherapy improved their functional ability (mean 23%) compared to the nonexercisers who showed significant declines in functional ability (mean -15%). Weight gain is a common side effect for women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and may have negative long-term implications for survival. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on weight gain in women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.

Median patient age was 65 years and 33 patients were male. The study cohort was randomly divided into a treatment group receiving adjuvant therapy with mistletoe lectin and a control group receiving no additional treatment. Patients in the treatment group received mistletoe lectin according to schedule 2 weeks after transurethral resection. Clinical followup was assessed 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the initial resection, and included uretherocystoscopy. Both study arms comprised similar patients with regard to total number of previous tumors (mean 2.6 versus 2.9), number of primary lesions (14 versus 12) and number of recurrent tumors (8 versus 11). After followup of 18 months the recurrence-free interval in both study arms was similar (p = 0.76) and the total number of recurrences comparable (p = 0.48). Subcutaneous use of mistletoe lectin as adjuvant treatment after transurethral resection does not seem to affect the time to first recurrence, total number of recurrences or recurrence-free outcome. The indication for topic chemotherapy or immunotherapy for well differentiated, noninvasive superficial bladder cancer remains controversial. Side effects of these treatments promoted use of unconventional therapies with cytokines, immunomodulators and mistletoe extracts. However, there are no controlled clinical data available on the efficacy of these extracts for bladder cancer.

The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of green tea extract (GTE) used as a food antioxidant on markers of oxidative status after dietary depletion of flavonoids and catechins. The study was designed as a 2 x 3 weeks blinded human cross-over intervention study (eight smokers, eight non-smokers) with GTE corresponding to a daily intake of 18.6 mg catechins/d. The GTE was incorporated into meat patties and consumed with a strictly controlled diet otherwise low in flavonoids. GTE intervention increased plasma antioxidant capacity from 1.35 to 1.56 (P<0.02) in postprandially collected plasma, most prominently in smokers. The intervention did not significantly affect markers in fasting blood samples, including plasma or haemoglobin protein oxidation, plasma oxidation lagtime, or activities of the erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and catalase. Neither were fasting plasma triacylglycerol, cholesterol, alpha-tocopherol, retinol, beta-carotene, or ascorbic acid affected by intervention. Urinary 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine excretion was also unaffected. Catechins from the extract were excreted into urine with a half-life of less than 2 h in accordance with the short-term effects on plasma antioxidant capacity. Since no long-term effects of GTE were observed, the study essentially served as a fruit and vegetables depletion study. The overall effect of the 10-week period without dietary fruits and vegetables was a decrease in oxidative damage to DNA, blood proteins, and plasma lipids, concomitantly with marked changes in antioxidative defence.

The first defecation was 2.7 days sooner in the gum-chewing group (postoperative day 3.1) than in the control group (5.8 days; p< 0.01). All patients tolerated gum chewing on the first operative AM. The postoperative hospital stays for the gum-chewing and control groups were 13.5+/-3.0 days and 14.5+/-6.1 days, respectively. Postoperative ileus limits early hospital discharge for patients who have undergone laparoscopic procedures. Sham feeding has been reported to enhance bowel motility. Here, the effect of gum chewing is evaluated as a convenient method to enhance postoperative recovery from ileus after laparoscopic colectomy. A total of 19 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer participated in the study. Each patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups: a gum-chewing group (n = 10, mean age 58.6 years, range 50 to 71 years) or a control group (n = 9, mean age 60.6 years, range 45 to 80 years). The patients in the gum-chewing group chewed gum three times a day from the first postoperative AM until oral intake. The times of the first passage of flatus and defecation were recorded precisely. Gum chewing aids early recovery from postoperative ileus and is an inexpensive and physiologic method for stimulating bowel motility. Gum chewing should be added as an adjunct treatment in postoperative care because it might contribute to shorter hospital stays.

This paper reports a nonrandomized, nonblinded trial with historically matched controls from archival tissue designed to determine the effects of acute exposure to a dietary supplement of isoflavones in men with clinically significant prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy. Thirty-eight patients were recruited to the study upon diagnosis of prostate cancer. Before surgery, 20 men consumed 160 mg/day of red clover-derived dietary isoflavones, containing a mixture of genistein, daidzein, formononetin, and biochanin A. Serum PSA, testosterone, and biochemical factors were measured, and clinical and pathological parameters were recorded. The incidence of apoptosis in prostate tumor cells from radical prostatectomy specimens was compared between 18 treated and 18 untreated control tissues. There were no significant differences between pre- and posttreatment serum PSA, Gleason score, serum testosterone, or biochemical factors in the treated patients (P > 0.05). Apoptosis in radical prostatectomy specimens from treated patients was significantly higher than in control subjects (P = 0.0018), specifically in regions of low to moderate-grade cancer (Gleason grade 1-3). No adverse events related to the treatment were reported. This report suggests that dietary isoflavones may halt the progression of prostate cancer by inducing apoptosis in low to moderate-grade tumors, potentially contributing to the lower incidence of clinically significant disease in Asian men. The assessment of new prostatic therapies aimed at increasing apoptosis should control for intake of dietary isoflavones.

Three measurements were used for the detection of arm lymphoedema: arm circumferences (CIRC), arm volume (VOL) and multi-frequency bioimpedance (MFBIA). Clinically significant lymphoedema was confirmed by an increase of at least 200 ml from the preoperative difference between the two arms. Using this definition, the incidence of lymphoedema at 24 mo. was 21%, with a rate of 11% in the TG compared to 30% in the CG. The CIRC or MFBIA methods failed to detect lymphoedema in up to 50% of women who demonstrated an increase of at least 200 ml in the VOL of the operated arm compared to the unoperated arm. The physiotherapy intervention programme for the TG women included principles for lymphoedema risk minimisation and early management of this condition when it was identified. These strategies appear to reduce the development of secondary lymphoedema and alter its progression in comparison to the CG women. Monitoring of these women is continuing and will determine if these benefits are maintained over a longer period for women with early lymphoedema after breast cancer surgery.

Ten participants were enrolled in the treatment protocol in a multiple-baseline design. Intervention time series analyses of daily sleep diary data revealed significant improvements of sleep efficiency and total wake time. These results were corroborated by polysomnographic data. In addition, insomnia treatment was associated with significant improvements of mood, general and physical fatigue, and global and cognitive dimensions of quality of life. These findings suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy, previously found effective for primary insomnia, is also of clinical benefit for insomnia secondary to cancer.

Samples were collected and measurements performed before and after the 4-week treatment period for determination of safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of green tea polyphenol treatment. Adverse events reported during the 4-week treatment period include excess gas, upset stomach, nausea, heartburn, stomach ache, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and muscle pain. All of the reported events were rated as mild events. For most events, the incidence reported in the polyphenol-treated groups was not more than that reported in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in blood counts and blood chemistry profiles after repeated administration of green tea polyphenol products. There was a >60% increase in the area under the plasma EGCG concentration-time curve after 4 weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at a dosing schedule of 800 mg once daily. No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of EGCG after repeated green tea polyphenol treatment at a regimen of 400 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of the conjugated metabolites of epigallocatechin and epicatechin were not affected by repeated green tea polyphenol treatment. Four weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at the selected dose and dosing schedule did not provide protection against UV-induced erythema. We conclude that it is safe for healthy individuals to take green tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the EGCG content in 8-16 cups of green tea once a day or in divided doses twice a day for 4 weeks. There is a >60% increase in the systemic availability of free EGCG after chronic green tea polyphenol administration at a high daily bolus dose (800 mg EGCG or Polyphenon E once daily). Green tea and green tea polyphenols have been shown to possess cancer preventive activities in preclinical model systems. In preparation for future green tea intervention trials, we have conducted a clinical study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of green tea polyphenols after 4 weeks of daily p.o. administration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or Polyphenon E (a defined, decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture). In an exploratory fashion, we have also determined the effect of chronic green tea polyphenol administration on UV-induced erythema response.

Theoretically, intake of antioxidants by consumption of fruits and vegetables should protect against reactive oxygen species and decrease the formation of oxidative DNA damage. We set up a parallel 24-day dietary placebo-controlled intervention study in which 43 subjects were randomized into three groups receiving an antioxidant-free basal diet and 600 g of fruits and vegetables, or a supplement containing the corresponding amounts of vitamins and minerals, or placebo. Blood and urine samples were collected before, once a week, and 4 weeks after the intervention period. The level of strand breaks, endonuclease III sites, formamidopyrimidine sites, and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide was assessed in mononuclear blood cells by the comet assay. Excretion of 7-hydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanine was measured in urine. The expressions of oxoguanine glycosylase 1 and excision repair cross complementing 1 DNA repair genes, determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR of mRNAs, were investigated in leukocytes. Consumption of fruits and vegetables or vitamins and minerals had no effect on oxidative DNA damage measured in mononuclear cell DNA or urine. Hydrogen peroxide sensitivity, detected by the comet assay, did not differ between the groups. Expression of excision repair cross complementing 1 and oxoguanine glycosylase 1 in leukocytes was not related to the diet consumed. Our results show that after 24 days of complete depletion of fruits and vegetables, or daily ingestion of 600 g of fruit and vegetables, or the corresponding amount of vitamins and minerals, the level of oxidative DNA damage was unchanged. This suggests that the inherent antioxidant defense mechanisms are sufficient to protect circulating mononuclear blood cells from reactive oxygen species.

Isothiocyanates are thought to inhibit the development of cancer cells by a number of mechanisms. The effect of cooking cabbage on isothiocyanate production from glucosinolates during and after their ingestion was examined in human subjects. Each of 12 healthy human volunteers consumed three meals, at 48-h intervals, containing either raw cabbage, cooked cabbage, or mustard according to a cross-over design. At each meal, watercress juice, which is rich in phenethyl isothiocyanate, was also consumed to allow individual and temporal variation in postabsorptive isothiocyanate recovery to be measured. Volunteers recorded the time and volume of each urination for 24 h after each meal. Samples of each urination were analyzed for N-acetyl cysteine conjugates of isothiocyanates as a measure of entry of isothiocyanates into the peripheral circulation. Excretion of isothiocyanates was rapid and substantial after ingestion of mustard, a source of preformed allyl isothiocyanate. After raw cabbage consumption, allyl isothiocyanate was again rapidly excreted, although to a lesser extent than when mustard was consumed. On the cooked cabbage treatment, excretion of allyl isothiocyanate was considerably less than for raw cabbage, and the excretion was delayed. The results indicate that isothiocyanate production is more extensive after consumption of raw vegetables but that isothiocyanates still arise, albeit to a lesser degree, when cooked vegetables are consumed. The lag in excretion on the cooked cabbage treatment suggests that the colon microflora catalyze glucosinolate hydrolysis in this case.

Theaceae), have been reported to have a wide range of biological activities including prevention of tooth decay and oral cancer. The present study was undertaken to determine the usefulness of green tea leaves and black tea extract for the delivery of catechins and theaflavins to the oral cavity. After holding either green tea leaves (2 g) or brewed black tea (2 g of black tea leaves in 100 ml) in the mouth for 2-5 min and thoroughly rinsing the mouth, high concentrations of catechins (C(max) = 131.0-2.2 micro M) and theaflavins (C(max) = 1.8-0.6 micro M) were observed in saliva in the 1st hour. Whereas there was significant interindividual variation in the peak levels of catechins and theaflavins, the overall kinetic profile was similar, with t(1/2) = 25-44 min and 49-76 min for catechins and theaflavins, respectively (average coefficient of variation in t(1/2) was 23.4%). In addition to the parent catechin and theaflavin peaks, five unidentified peaks were also observed in saliva after black tea treatment. Hydrolysis of theaflavin gallates, apparently by salivary esterases, was observed in vitro and in vivo.

Utilizing digital photographs as an adjunct to screening appeared to increase patient adherence to performing SSE. In Group A (teaching intervention with photo book), 10.2% of the patients at baseline reported skin examination three or more times during the past 4 months, while 61.2% reported skin examination three or more times at the 4-month follow-up (p =0.039 for paired comparison). In Group B (teaching intervention only), nearly 20% of the patients at baseline reported skin examination three or more times during the past 4 months, while 37% reported skin examination three or more times at the 4-month follow-up (p =0.63). The increase in reported skin examination was compared between the two groups (>51% v >17.6%, p =0.001). Patients were randomized: Group A (n =49) received a teaching intervention (physician and nurse education module) with a photo book (personal whole-body photographs compiled in the form of a booklet, with nurse instruction on how to use the photographs); and Group B (n =51) received the teaching intervention only without a photo book. MAIN OUTCOMES/MEASURES: Self-administered questionnaires were provided at three intervals: baseline, post-teaching intervention, and at the 4-month post-baseline visit. To assess adherence with SSE, patients were asked, ""How many times in the past 4 months did you (or someone else) usually, thoroughly examine your skin?"" Results from a single case-control study suggest that skin self-examination (SSE) has the potential to reduce mortality from melanoma by 63%. Despite these encouraging results, SSE rates are low. Few prospective studies of interventions to increase SSE in high-risk cohorts have been performed. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a brief nurse-delivered intervention using digital photographs on patients' adherence to performing SSE.

The subjects were contacted again 1 year after their visit to assess their receipt of prostate cancer screening (digital rectal examination [DRE] or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] testing), their satisfaction with their screening decision, and knowledge retention since the baseline assessment. Decision aids for prostate cancer screening can have a long-term effect on screening behavior and appear to promote informed decision making. Follow-up assessments were completed for 87.5% of the intervention subjects and 83.8% of the control subjects. The rate of DRE did not differ between the 2 groups. Prostate-specific antigen testing was reported by 24 of 70 (34.3%) intervention subjects and 37 of 67 (55.2%) control subjects (P = .01). African American men were more likely to have had PSA testing (9 of 16, 56.3%) than were white men (13 of 46, 28.3%) (P = .044). Satisfaction with the screening decision did not differ between the study groups. Intervention subjects were more knowledgeable of prostate cancer screening than were control subjects, although these differences declined within 1 year (P < .001).

Of the 32 intervention patients, 16 received physician-administered intervention, and 16 received reinforced counseling (physician + counselor). Of 113 total patients, 90 (82%) were African American; mean age was 26 years (SD +/- 7.7 years). Of the 81 non-intervention patients, six (7%; 95% CI = 3% to 15%) said they were told that a Pap test was not done, and 60 (74%; 95% CI = 64% to 82%) mistakenly believed they had a Pap test. Sixty-six (81.5%; 95% CI = 72% to 88%) patients stated they knew the purpose of a Pap test; only 17 (26%; 95% CI = 17% to 37%) of these correctly identified the Pap test as a test for cervical cancer. All 32 intervention patients were surveyed after physician counseling. Compared with the non-intervention group, fewer (56%; 95% CI = 39% to 72%) thought they had a Pap test, and more (31%; 95% CI = 18% to 49%) said they were told they did not receive a Pap test. All 16 reinforced intervention patients correctly denied receiving a Pap test after counselor education. Failure to obtain cervical cancer screening can be precipitated by limited knowledge. This study describes understanding of Papanicolaou (Pap) smear testing among women undergoing emergency department (ED) pelvic examination and tests the feasibility of educating patients in the ED. Knowledge of Pap testing among women undergoing ED pelvic examination is poor; most mistakenly believe they receive a Pap test during ED evaluation. Educating patients may be feasible and effective in the ED setting. Patients undergoing pelvic examination in an urban, tertiary care ED were surveyed about Pap smear screening. Among the initial cohort, no education was provided prior to survey administration. Subsequently, a pilot study of scripted information provided by physicians alone or both physicians and counselors was conducted.

The three interventions were evaluated using a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. Results of this study confirm a high rate of loss to screening follow-up (i.e., no return visits) among women with abnormal pap smears (29% overall), with substantial variability among the 12 participating clinics (13% to 42/%). For the sample as a whole, both transportation incentives and the combined intervention condition of personalized follow-up and slide-tape program had a significant positive impact on screening follow-up. However, transportation incentives emerged as the dominant intervention condition among patient subgroups that can be characterized as more disadvantaged socioeconomically and at higher risk of developing cervical cancer, including patients receiving care from the county health department (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51; P less than .05); patients without health insurance (OR = 1.77; P less than .01); and patients with more severe pap smear results (OR = 1.71; P less than .05). In contrast, among patient subgroups that can be characterized as relatively more advantaged and at lower risk of developing cervical cancer, only the combined intervention condition of personalized follow-up and slide-tape program was associated with a higher patient return rate. Subgroups reflecting this pattern included patients seen in noncounty clinics (OR = 4.54; P less than .05) and patients with less severe pap smear results (OR = 5.16; P less than .01). The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of designing clinic-based interventions to improve screening follow-up.

There was no statistically significant relationship between the anxiety and pain levels. Women who had recently felt tense and nervous or had a fear of breast cancer diagnosis had higher anxiety levels. Our data shows that informing patients about examination decreases the level of pain due to mammographic compression, but does not alter the anxiety level. The main cause of anxiety appears to be the fear of a malignant diagnosis. Any intervention to decrease this fear may increase the compliance rates for screening mammography. To investigate whether informing patients about mammographic compression changed the anxiety and pain that they experience during mammography. Five hundred and one patients were enrolled in the study. Two hundred and fifty seven (51.3%) were informed before the procedure by written forms explaining the necessity of compression.

The efficacy found in this trial seems to be more than would be expected by a placebo effect (20%-30% hot flash reduction in previous trials). These results suggest that further evaluation of this black cohosh preparation with a phase III randomized trial is indicated. Twenty-one women completed the study. Their mean age was 56 years (range, 38-80). Thirteen patients had a history of breast cancer. Six patients were taking tamoxifen or raloxifene. Patients reported an average of 8.3 hot flashes per day during the baseline week. The reduction in mean daily hot flash frequency was 50% (95% CI, 34%-65%), while weekly hot flash scores were reduced 56% (95% CI, 40%-71%) at completion of the study. Overall, patients reported less trouble with sleeping, less fatigue, and less abnormal sweating. No patients stopped therapy because of adverse effects. Women who reported significant hot flashes (> or = 14 per week) were enrolled. Black cohosh was given in the form of the commercial product Remifemin. The first week was a no-treatment baseline period, and therapy was given for the subsequent 4 weeks. Hot flash data were collected by daily questionnaires during baseline and treatment weeks.

A total of 1588 patients aged 45-64 years were randomized to one of four intervention groups. In the first group patients were posted a Haemoccult test (Kline Beckman) kit. This group was not invited for a health check. In the second group patients were posted the Haemoccult test kit, together with an invitation to attend for a health check. In the third group patients were posted an invitation for a health check, which explained that the patient would be offered the Haemoccult test kit by the nurse at the health check. In the fourth group patients were just invited for a health check. It was found that combining faecal occult blood testing with the health check did not reduce attendance at the health check--43.5% of patients attended when the Haemoccult test kit was offered by the nurse at the health check, 43.6% attended when a test kit was included with the invitation to attend the health check and 42.9% attended when the health check invitation was posted on its own. Overall, compliance with Haemoccult testing was not significantly increased by associating it with a health check (26.2% versus 25.5%) but compliance was higher when the faecal occult blood testing kit was enclosed with the health check invitation than when it was offered at the health check (31.7% versus 20.6%, P less than 0.001). It is easier and cheaper to combine various screening procedures. Although the overall use of the Haemoccult test in the study population was low, there is no reason why the relatively higher compliance rate obtained on posting the test kit with a health check invitation cannot be achieved in previously unscreened populations with higher expected compliance rates. However, faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer should not be undertaken on a population basis until its effectiveness in reducing mortality has been proven by randomized trial.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the effect of 14 weeks of beta-carotene supplementation on the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in lymphocytes in 143 heavy smokers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial. Age, smoking habits and pretreatment blood levels of cotinine, beta-carotene, retinol and vitamins C and E were similar in the placebo group (n = 73) and the treatment group (n = 70). Plasma beta-carotene levels increased 13-fold in the treatment group during intervention, whereas the other parameters remained stable in both groups. Initial SCE levels were similar in the treatment and placebo groups (5.10 +/- 0.98 vs. 5.00 +/- 0.99 SCE/lymphocyte). During the intervention, both groups showed an almost identical decrease, and at the end of the intervention period there was no difference in SCE levels between the treatment and the placebo groups (4.37 +/- 0.38 vs. 4.24 +/- 0.37 SCE/lymphocyte). This study shows no protective effect of beta-carotene on DNA damage as reflected by sister chromatid exchanges in lymphocytes. Our results thus do not yield support for a cancer-preventive mechanism of beta-carotene involving this form of DNA damage. It cannot be excluded, however, that beta-carotene prevents other forms of smoking-induced DNA damage, affects other tissues, or is preventive in later stages of carcinogenesis.

A repeated-measures experimental design was used to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief behavioral sleep intervention for family caregivers of persons with advanced stage cancer. The CAregiver Sleep Intervention (CASI) includes stimulus control, relaxation, cognitive therapy, and sleep hygiene elements. CASI is individualized and delivered to accommodate caregiver burden. Thirty adult caregivers participated. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale (CES-D), and Caregiver Quality of Life-Cancer scale (CQOLC) were used to measure self-reported sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Actigraphs measured latency, duration, efficiency, and wake after sleep onset (WASO) scores. Data were collected at baseline, 3 and 5 weeks, 2, 3, and 4 months post baseline. Improvement was seen across groups; however, intervention caregivers showed more improvement in PSQI and CES-D scores than control caregivers.

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has recently utilized the art therapy modality to help patients communicate the painful side of their illness in such a way that they can feel understood and respected. In this paper we describe a simple innovative art therapy intervention that we have developed within the Art Therapy Service in the Psychiatric Department of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The patients work with a Body Outline as a starting template, together with the art therapist, in sessions lasting approximately 45 minutes. They are encouraged to fill the space inside and outside the Body Outline. They can use colored pastels, markers, or watercolor or cut out images for a collage. The results suggest that because of its abstract symbolic feature, the Body Outline is a very flexible therapeutic intervention. It must be offered within the relationship with the art therapist, and it may fulfill quite a variety of expressive needs, from the description of physical pain to the elaboration of spiritual longings.

It was concluded that gum-chewing provides a simple and effective method to improve the postoperative state of patients. Twenty-two patients with colorectal cancer were divided into two groups; gum-chewing and control groups. From after their operation, chewing gum was given to the former group three times a day. During the perioperative period after open colorectal surgery, surgical stress affects changes in the autonomic nervous system of patients. The decreased intestinal motility results in many complaints for patients. To resolve this problem, the usefulness of gum-chewing for improving the motility was examined.

The occurrence rates of side effects in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.01). The Karnofsky score of life quality of the study group was obviously higher than that of the control group after treatment (P<0.05). The half survival time and one year survival rate in the study group and control group were (24.9 +/- 1.36) month, 70% (28/40) and (13.7 +/- 0.72) month, 35% (14/40) respectively. They were significantly improved in the study group compared with the control group (P<0.01). The levels of cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) after treatment in the study group were significantly higher than those before treatment (P<0.05 or P<0.01), as well as than those after treatment in the control group (P<0.01). On the other hand, the level of immune inhibitory factor soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) after treatment in the study group was lower than that before treatment, as well as than that after treatment in the control group (P<0.01). To investigate the immunoregulation and short-term therapeutic effects of super-selective intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with Fuzheng Kang'ai Granules, a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on patients with late gastric cancer. Forty patients with late gastric antrum cancer were randomly divided into study group and control group. Patients in the study group were orally administered Fuzheng Kang'ai Granules 48 hours after the first super-selective left gastric artery chemotherapy with high-dose drugs (EAP regime: VP(16) 100 mg/m(2) + epirubicin 60 mg/m(2) + carboplatin 200 mg/m(2)), while patients in the control group were only administered the same local artery chemotherapy as in the study group. The super-selective intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with Fuzheng Kang'ai Granules has good short-term therapeutic efficiency and few side effects for patients with late gastric antrum cancer. It can significantly improve the life quality, extend the survival period, and improve the survival rate in patients with late gastric antrum cancer, which may be due to the up-regulation of the immune regulating factors such as IL-2, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and down-regulation of the immune inhibitory factor sIL-2R.

However, patients often refuse continued therapy because of suboptimal control of nausea and vomiting and substantial decline in nutritional status. In this pilot study, 19 patients receiving cisplatin were evaluated for nausea and vomiting, amount of food intake, and subjective assessment of well-being. The study group received a colorless, odorless, predetermined meal three times daily; the meal included cottage cheese, apple sauce, vanilla ice cream, and other selected foods. Control-group patients selected their own meal. Study-group patients exhibited higher overall food intake, decreased nausea and vomiting, and a higher scored estimation of well-being. The findings of this preliminary study indicate that the study diet helps provide nutrition care to cancer patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy and helps create an atmosphere where the patient believes he or she has some control in the treatment outcome.

We designed a randomized trial of two interventions additional to usual care. We recruited 17 male general practitioners selected at random from the inner metropolitan region of Sydney, Australia. The patients were 202 women, between 20 and 65 years of age, eligible for a Pap smear. We allocated minimal and maximal interactional interventions to obtain consent for a Pap smear. Our main outcome measure was women's having a Pap smear during the consultation or within one month. We also measured acceptability of interventions to practitioners and women. These were our results: minimal: 55% of women had a Pap smear; maximal: 67% of women had a Pap smear; total when both approaches are combined: 61%. We conclude that brief advice is as effective as maximal persuasion in increasing women's compliance with opportunistic screening in routine consultations. Both interventions were acceptable to women. Practitioners preferred the minimal intervention. We demonstrate opportunistic screening is an effective and acceptable way to encourage women at risk to have a Pap smear.

The aim of this study is to examine the effects of a omega-3 fatty acid-containing diet (Racol) on the toxicity of chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for patients with esophageal cancers. Toxicity of CRT was evaluated in 10 patients who took Rakol at a maximum dose of 600 mL/day during CRT, compared with 10 patients who did not take Rakol. Regarding blood toxicity, the decrease of platelets did not differ between the former and the latter. However, the incidence of grade 2~4 neutropenia was lower in the former than in the latter (p=0.0043). With regard to gastrointestinal toxicity, the incidence of grade 2~4 diarrhea was also lower in the former than in the latter (p=0.0118). Moreover, the incidence of grade 2~4 stomatitis/pharyngitis tended to decrease in patients who took Rakol compared with those who did not (p=0.0812).

The extraordinary lung cancer rates result from combined exposure to radon, arsenic, and tobacco smoking (cigarettes and/or bamboo water pipe). A study to determine the feasibility of conducting a large-scale, lung-cancer chemoprevention trial was conducted in 1986 among currently employed or retired miners from the Yunnan Tin Corporation in the city of Gejiu. The study was designed to answer four questions: (i) Could potentially eligible miners be identified and recruited? (ii) Could intervention agents be shipped successfully from the United States to the study area and be appropriately distributed? (iii) Would miners adequately adhere to the study protocol and comply with the intervention regimen? (iv) Could potential adverse effects be monitored and documented? The six-month feasibility study yielded affirmative answers to each of these questions. A roster of over 7,000 high-risk miners was compiled. Four agents (vitamin A, 25,000 IU; beta-carotene, 50 mg; vitamin E, 800 IU; and selenium, 400 micrograms) were administered daily with placebos to 350 miners according to a 2(4) factorial design. Adherence, assessed by pill counts and serum micronutrient levels, was approximately 90 percent.

464,151505,Communication and awareness about death: a study of a random sample of dying people.,Social science & medicine (1982),2031210,"The literature suggests that doctors' and nurses' openness about communicating with the terminally ill and their families has increased in the past two or three decades, partly influenced by the hospice movement. The present study reports the perceptions of relatives, hospital doctors, general practitioners and nurses who knew a random sample of 639 adults dying in England in 1987. The results from professionals suggest a general preference for openness about illness and death, tempered by the consideration that bad news needs to be broken slowly, in a context of support, while recognising that not everyone wishes to know all. In practice people dying from cancer were more likely to be reported as knowing what their illness was and that they would die than were people dying from other conditions. This difference held when controlling for the fact that death was more likely to be medically expected in cancer. Comparisons with 1969 show that the increases were due largely to cancer patients being told the truth more frequently by hospital doctors. This may be due to changed practices, or to the increase in the number of hospital episodes in the last year of life. Nevertheless, situations of 'closed awareness' where relatives were told and patients were not, and situations where patients were left to guess the likely outcome for themselves, were still quite common in 1987. Nurses and hospice practitioners were only marginally involved in breaking bad news, this remaining the province of hospital doctors and general practitioners. Relatives in general praised the manner in which they and patients were told, although a small proportion reported insensitive practice. In retrospect a high proportion of both relatives and professionals felt that the levels of awareness were best as they were, although this preference may have been influenced by a desire to see things in a good light. Most relatives reported adequate support and information being given by professionals to them during the patient's illness. On the whole, doctors provided information, and friends and family provided emotional support to relatives. Again, hospital doctors played an increasingly important role compared to 1969 in providing information, with general practitioners' role decreasing in this area. Gaps in information included not being told enough about what was wrong with the patient, not being told the reasons for decisions about treatment and, to a lesser extent, not being given information about how to care for the patient.

Women ages 45-69 years at increased risk of breast cancer were randomized into intervention (low-fat diet, n = 184) and control (usual diet, n = 119) groups. On the basis of 4-day food records, baseline fat intakes were comparable in the two groups, averaging 1,718 kcal with 39% of energy as fat. Intervention women reported substantially lower fat intake at 6 (20.9% kcal), 12 (21.6%), and 24 months (22.6% kcal). In contrast, control women reported only slight reductions in fat intake (37.3% kcal at 12 months and 36.8% kcal at 24 months). Evidence that these women were indeed complying with the low-fat dietary intervention comes from (a) the reasonable nature of reported nutrient changes within food groups in the intervention women and (b) agreement between observed and expected differences in plasma total cholesterol between the control and the intervention groups. At 12 months, the observed control - intervention plasma cholesterol difference was 13.1 +/- 4.6 mg/dl while the expected difference based on the Keys equation was 15.1 +/- 1.1 mg/dl; at 24 months, the observed difference was 15.5 +/- 4.3 mg/dl and the expected difference was 12.0 +/- 1.2 mg/dl. These analyses indicate that the intervention women made substantial dietary changes and have successfully maintained these changes over a 2-year period.

Total shivering duration was shorter in the treatment group than in the control, p less than .005. Less meperidine was administered to the treatment group than to controls but differences were not statistically significant. The fact that nurses differ in their propensity to use a narcotic to treat shivering may make use of meperidine a poor measure of the intervention's efficacy. Shivering was found to significantly affect myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) among subjects who shivered.

The programs were designed to be presented sequentially at three critical points during a course of treatment: Pretreatment, Treatment Week 2, and Final Treatment Week. A total of 72 patients, 24 per program, with cancers of the lung, breast, or prostate, were assessed for their level of knowledge after hearing the audiotape appropriate to their treatment phase (posttest). Half of the patients, on a random basis, were also assessed prior to hearing their tape (pretest). This split design allowed the differentiation of true learning effects from effects of multiple assessments. Knowledge test items were developed from learning objectives for each program. Posttest results indicate a very high level of patient learning for all three programs, significantly exceeding the target of 75% correct. For patients tested twice, posttest scores were significantly higher than pretest scores. No testing effects were found for the Pretreatment and Treatment Week 2 programs. Final Treatment Week subjects who were pretested scored slightly higher on the posttest than their controls who were not pretested; however, additional analysis demonstrated true learning effects for this group as well.

Sickness was either completely absent or reduced considerably in 97% of patients and no side effects were encountered. The limited crossover study, using a 'dummy' acupuncture (ACP) point showed that the beneficial effects were limited to the P6 point. Logistic and ethical considerations excluded the possibility of carrying out a larger placebo-controlled study.

472,156340,A randomized clinical trial of home nursing care for lung cancer patients.,Cancer,2670188,"A randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess the effects of home nursing care for patients with progressive lung cancer. One hundred sixty-six patients were assigned to either an oncology home care group (OHC) that received care from oncology home care nurses, a standard home care group (SHC) that received care from regular home care nurses, or an office care group (OC) that received whatever care they needed except for home care. Patients were entered into the study 2 months after diagnosis and followed for 6 months. Patients were interviewed at 6-week intervals across five occasions. At the end of the study, there were no differences in pain, mood disturbance, and concerns among the three groups. There were significant differences in symptom distress, enforced social dependency, and health perceptions. The two home nursing care groups had less distress and greater independence 6 weeks longer than the office care group. In addition, the two home nursing care groups steadily reported worse health perceptions over time. Thus, it was remarkable that the office care group, which indicated more symptom distress and social dependency with time, also indicated perceptions of improved health with time.

The aim of this clinical trial was to test the efficacy of propolis as a mouthwash in the reduction of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis (OM) in a single center. In this randomised, controlled study patients undergoing chemotherapy were included consecutively and randomised to an experimental group receiving propolis mouthwash (n = 20) and a control group receiving diluted water (n=20). Oral mucositis, erythema and eating and drink ability were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 7 days using the World Health Organization (WHO) scale and the oral mucositis assessment scale (OMAS). There were significant differences in OM, wound and erythema in propolis group compared to placebo, but no significant difference in eating and drink ability. However, it was interesting that 65% of the patients in the propolis group were completely healed at day 7 of the trial. No significant adverse events were reported by the patients. This study found that oral care with propolis as mouthwash for patients undergoing chemotherapy is an effective intervention to improve oral health. Our findings shouldlencourage health practitioners to apply propolis mouth rinse for the oral care of patients under chemotherapy.

474,157219,"A decision aid versus shared decision making for prostate cancer screening: results of a randomized, controlled trial.",The Canadian journal of urology,28832310,"Shared decision making (SDM) is widely encouraged by both the American Urological Association and Choosing Wisely for prostate cancer screening. Implementation of SDM is challenging secondary to time constraints and competing patient priorities. One strategy to mitigate the difficulties in implementing SDM is to utilize a decision aid (DA). Here we evaluate whether a DA improves a patient's prostate cancer knowledge and affects prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates. Providing patients a DA without a personal interaction resulted in a greater chance of undergoing PSA-based screening without improving knowledge about screening or understanding of the consequences of this decision. This effect was exacerbated by a shorter term provider relationship. With complex issues such as the decision to pursue PSA-based prostate cancer screening, tools cannot substitute for direct interaction with a trusted provider. A total of 329 patients were randomized. Patients in the DA + SDM arm were significantly more likely to report discussing the implication of screening (33% DA + SDM, 22% UC, 16% DA, p = 0.0292) and answered significantly more knowledge questions correctly compared to the UC arm (5.03 versus 4.46, p = 0.046). However, those in the DA arm were significantly less likely to report that they always felt encouraged to discuss all health concerns (72% DA, 78% DA + SDM, 87% UC, p = 0.0285). Interestingly, STPR patients in the DA arm were significantly more likely to undergo PSA-based prostate cancer screening (41%) than the UC arm (8%, p = 0.019). This effect was not observed in the LTPR group. Patients were randomized to usual care (UC), DA, or DA + SDM. Perception of quality of care was measured using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. Outcomes were stratified by long term provider relationship (LTPR, > 3 years) versus short term provider relationship (STPR, < 3 years). Knowledge of prostate cancer screening and the decision regarding screening were assessed. Groups were compared using ANOVA and logistic regression models.

475,157674,The effect of different compression pressure in therapy of secondary upper extremity lymphedema in women after breast cancer surgery.,Lymphology,30248729,"This study evaluated how different levels of pressure under inelastic multi-layer bandages affect the reduction of secondary arm lymphedema and patient comfort throughout therapy. Ninety-six women with lymphedema after breast cancer treatment were randomized into three groups of 32 patients depending on level of applied pressure in compression therapy: group I (control) at 21-30 mmHg; study groups II A at 31-40 mmHg and group II B at 41-60 mmHg. All patients were treated with complex decongestive therapy (CDT) and intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) before compression. Fixed points of bilateral arms were measured at the start (first visit), after 24 h, 7 days, and 14 days of therapy. Edema severity was measured by summary calculation. Results were presented as a relative metric coefficient of arm lymphedema (RMCAL) which is the difference between sums of circumferences of the edematous arm and the contralateral side expressed in percents. In order to evaluate the patient comfort after finishing a two-week therapy all patients assessed the level of accompanying pain using the numeric pain rating scale (NRS). At the start of therapy median arm circumference difference (RMCAL) was 18.60%, 18.51%, and 19.05% in groups I-II B, respectively. After 24 h the median RMCAL was reduced to 14.49%, 12.13%, and 12.64%. This was further reduced to 10.77%, 6.98%, and 8.48% at one week and 10.28%, 5.75%, and 7.20% in each group, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between RMCAL values in group II A and II B throughout the therapy. In group II A (NRS = 2), applied bandages were better tolerated than in both II B (NRS = 5) and control groups (NRS = 8). These results demonstrate that inelastic multi-layer bandages applied in groups II A and II B (41-60 mmHg) led to the same reduction of swollen arm circumference with group II being better tolerated. The lowest compression (control at 21-30 mmHg) produced the smallest reduction. In addition, since the greatest reduction was seen in the first week of therapy while the second week served to maintain the reduction, compression garments may be able to be ordered after one week of therapy for more efficient patient care.

All patients were normocalcemic, and most patients had stable or regressing disease at start of trial. No improvement in general performance or bone pain was detected as measured by a visual analogue scale, the daily duration of pain or consumption of analgetic drugs. Calcitonin had no effect on disease progression as judged by bone scans and radiographs. Calcitonin therapy did not affect serum calcium, alkaline phosphatase, bone gla-protein, or the urinary excretion of calcium and hydroxyproline. Serum phosphate and magnesium decreased significantly during calcitonin treatment (p = 0.01, and 0.00005, respectively). It was concluded that salmon calcitonin in this dosage has no discernible effect on skeletal pain, general performance, bone metabolism or disease progression in patients with breast cancer metastatic to bone. A significant decrease in serum phosphate and magnesium probably indicated an effect of calcitonin on the renal excretion of these ions.

Seventy-three men with a history of 20 or more pack-years of cigarette smoking who had metaplasia on one or more sputum samples were stratified according to smoking level and randomly assigned to four months' treatment with either placebo or 10 mg of folate plus 500 micrograms of hydroxocobalamin. Direct cytological comparison of the two groups after four months showed significantly greater reduction of atypia in the supplemented group. This provides preliminary evidence that atypical bronchial squamous metaplasia may be reduced by supplementation with folate and vitamin B12. However, the significance of these findings is tempered by substantial spontaneous variation in sputum cytologies, the small study population, the short duration of the trial, and the supraphysiological doses of folate and B12 used. The results should not be construed as pointing to a potential way of preventing lung cancer in individuals who continue to smoke or as supporting self-medication with large doses of folate or B12 by smokers.

Thirty-three women in good health were randomly allocated to commence either a standard diet (deriving 40% of their energy from fat) or a low-fat diet (deriving 20% of their energy from fat). After 2 months, the women were crossed over to the alternative diet for another 2 months. Serum hormone and lipid levels were measured in the middle and at the end of each dietary period. In premenopausal women, the low-fat diet appeared to decrease levels of both non-protein-bound estradiol (1.48 down to 1.27%; P = .07) and non-protein-bound testosterone (1.06 down to 0.86%; P = .11). Cholesterol levels were lowered by the low-fat diet and were significantly associated with estradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was associated with estradiol and prolactin. For the postmenopausal women, the low-fat diet lowered cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels, but there were not the same associations with the hormones. These findings add weight to the concept that attention to diet may be a means of reducing the incidence of breast cancer in our community.

484,161639,"Controlled clinical trials of nutritional intervention as an adjunct to chemotherapy, with a comment on nutrition and drug resistance.",Cancer research,6799196,"Nutritional intervention in the cancer patient [e.g., total parenteral nutrition (TPN)] might improve durable survival because of increased tolerance to aggressive tumor therapy. To determine whether this assumption is correct, 42 patients with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma were induced with prednisone, high-dose methotrexate, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and VP-16 (ProMACE). Nitrogen mustard-vincristine-procarbazine-prednisone (MOPP) consolidation was then used, followed by late intensification with ProMACE. Patients were selected randomly to receive adjuvant TPN or a standard diet during ProMACE-MOPP treatment. While TPN patients had a greater median weight gain than did control patients, lean body mass and degree of myelosuppression did not improved as a consequence of TPN. There was no significant difference in tumor response or survival between TPN and control patients, whether or not the patients were initially malnourished. In a second trial, 32 young patients with metastatic or other poor-prognosis sarcomas were randomly allocated to receive TP or a standard diet as an adjunct to one very intensive course of combination chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus total body irradiation; autologous marrow transplantation was used with gain than did controls but remained in a negative nitrogen balance. Response rates and median durable survival did not differ between the two groups. In both trials, the maximum nutritional support permitted by currently available technology was offered. Thus, the limiting factor may not be nutritional status but rather the intrinsic biology of the tumors and the limitations of their response to current therapy. In in vitro studies of the possible influence of nutrition on cancer treatment, we have compared sublines of P388 murine leukemia cells which are sensitive or resistant to Adriamycin. The difference in drug sensitivity correlated with differences in lipid composition, with more intracellular lipid, and with greater membrane rigidity in the resistant cells. Resistant cells have a relatively poor transport of drug into the cell; moreover, intracellular Adriamycin is sequestered in lipid depots away from DNA. These results suggest one possible relationship between nutritional phenomena and drug sensitivity.

Results indicated that during both the training and the posttraining sessions, patients in the relaxation training condition reported feeling less emotionally distressed and nauseated, and showed less physiological arousal following the chemotherapy infusion, than patients in the no relaxation training condition. The attending nurses' observations confirmed the patients' self-reports. No differences were found in frequency of vomiting between conditions.

This method seems to be a new approach to oestrogenic therapy, and in spite of the inconvenience of rather frequent--though as a rule very slight--bleeding during the first months of treatment, it should be of value. After 3-4 mth of treatment bleeding practically never occurs and the endometrium almost invariably becomes completely atrophic. It would seem that this might imply a lowered risk of development of endometrial cancer. A series of 265 patients treated in accordance with this principle for up to more and than 4 yr is presented.

Medical records were reviewed to determine documented offering/receipt of clinical breast examination and mammography. A subgroup of women without previous clinical breast examination (n = 540) and without previous mammography (n = 471) were analyzed to determine the effect of the intervention. During the intervention period, women without a previous clinical breast examination were offered an examination significantly more often in the Prevention Team group than in the control group, adjusting for age, race, and comorbidity and for physicians' gender and training level. The patients in the Prevention Team group were offered clinical breast examination (31.5%) more frequently than those in the patient education or control groups, but this was not significant after adjusting for the above covariates. Likewise, mammography was offered more frequently to patients in the Prevention Team and in the patient education group than to patients in the control group, after adjusting for the factors above using logistic regression. The results provide support for patient education and organizational changes that involve nonphysician personnel to enhance breast cancer screening among older women, particularly those without previous screening.

During a half-day training session, each volunteer provided a list of 10 women she was willing to contact over a 6-month period and encourage to have a mammogram. Each list was randomized, and five names were returned to each volunteer for inclusion in the intervention. The other women served as controls and were not contacted by the volunteers. All women were subsequently interviewed at the end of the intervention period. Forty-nine percent of the women in the intervention group (n = 289) had received their most recent mammogram since the start of the intervention period, whereas 34% of control women (n = 305) received mammograms during the same time period (p < or = .001, rate ratio = 1.4, 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 1.7). The effectiveness of the intervention remained after controlling for demographic characteristics. The strategy was effective for both black and white women of all ages, but principally among women with annual household incomes of less than $40,000.

Serum and mucosal biopsy samples were obtained prior to and following 3 months daily p.o. supplementation with 30 mg of BC or placebo. The concentration of BC was significantly increased in serum and colonic mucosa from both polyp and cancer subjects following supplementation as compared to presupplementation values and values from subjects receiving a placebo.

The amino acid L-arginine can significantly enhance natural killer (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. In this study, the effect of L-arginine supplementation on natural cytotoxicity was determined in patients with breast cancer receiving CHOP chemotherapy. This cytotoxic regimen caused a transient immunosuppression, maximal on day 14 of each cycle (P < 0.001); this was not cumulative during the four cycles of treatment. Those patients receiving L-arginine supplementation (30 g/day for 3 days prior to each course of chemotherapy) had a smaller and delayed onset of immunosuppression (day 14), compared with those patients who had CHOP only (day 9). L-Arginine was able to repeatedly stimulate NK and LAK cell cytotoxicity in patients who were receiving CHOP chemotherapy (P < 0.003).

494,168781,Prospective study of chemoprevention of hepatocellular carcinoma with Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9).,Cancer,8625175,"TJ-9 helped to prevent the development of HCC in patients with cirrhosis, particularly in patients without HBs antigen. Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) arise in patients with cirrhosis, in whom its incidence is high. The prevention of HCC in patients with cirrhosis is important. A prospective, randomized, nonblind controlled study was performed to evaluate the preventive effect of Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9) on HCC development. TJ-9 is a Chinese herbal medicine that contains crude extracts of seven herbs; it has antitumor effects in experimental animals. Two hundred sixty patients with cirrhosis were randomly assigned to two groups, matched for age, sex, presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, and the severity of liver damage. The patients in the trial group were given TJ-9 at a daily oral dose of 7.5 g in addition to the conventional drugs given to the control patients. The patients were prospectively monitored for 60 months and the cumulative incidence of HCC and the survival rate in the two groups were calculated. The cumulative incidence curve for 5 years of the trial group was lower than that of the control group (P = 0.071). For the patients without HBs antigen, the difference was significant (P = 0.024). The survival curve for 5 years of the trial group was higher than that of the control group (P = 0.053). For the patients without HBs antigen, the difference was significant (P = 0.043).

495,168852,Increasing patient involvement in choosing treatment for early breast cancer.,Cancer,8635032,"Sixty patients with Stage I or II breast cancer (1) were pretested on their knowledge about breast cancer treatment and optimism for the future, (2) were randomly assigned to one of two methods for preconsultation education: interactive multimedia program or brochure, (3) completed knowledge and optimism measures, (4) consulted with a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and general surgeon, and (5) completed self-report measures assessing their involvement in the consultations and control over decision-making. The consultations were audiorecorded and analyzed to identify behavioral indicators of patient involvement (question-asking, opinion-giving, and expressing concern) and physician utterances encouraging patient participation. College-educated patients younger than 65 years of age were more active participants in these consultations than were older, less educated patients. In addition, patients showed more involvement when they interacted with physicians who encouraged and facilitated patient participation. The method of education did not affect patient involvement although patients tended to learn more about breast cancer treatment after using the multimedia program than after reading the brochure. Although patients vary in their expressiveness, physicians may be able to increase patient participation in deciding treatment by using patient-centered behavior. Also, preconsultation education appears to be an effective clinical strategy for helping patients gain an accurate understanding of their treatment options before meeting with physicians. This investigation examined factors affecting patient involvement in consultations to decide local treatment for early breast cancer and the effectiveness of two methods of preconsultation education aimed at increasing patient participation in these discussions.

Epidemiological studies have shown an association between low levels of dietary beta-carotene and CIN. In this Phase II study, we have explored the effect of p.o. beta-carotene administration on CIN I and II. Patients with documented CIN I or II were treated with 30 mg daily of beta-carotene for 6 months. Response rates were determined at 0, 3, 6, and 12 months with cytology, colposcopy, and/or biopsies. Levels of beta-carotene and vitamin E were determined at the same time intervals in vaginal mucosa cells and serum. Response rates were 18 of 30 (60%), 21 of 30 (70%), and 10 of 30 (33%) at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Significant changes occurred in the serum beta-carotene levels over time. Median levels over 2200 mg/ml were found at 3 and 6 months versus a baseline median level of 111 (P < 0.0001). Significant increases were also noted in the beta-carotene levels of the vaginal mucosa compared to baseline (P = 0.01) and a significant correlation was noted between serum and vaginal beta-carotene levels as well (P < 0.0001). This study indicates that a large percentage of patients with CIN I and II will respond clinically to p.o. beta-carotene supplementation. There is a positive relationship between serum and tissue levels of beta-carotene which suggests that serum levels can be used for monitoring purposes. Because of these encouraging results, prospective randomized studies are ongoing comparing the efficacy of beta-carotene against an untreated control arm.

One randomized group of patients receive daily N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant that may be protective especially in the early steps of carcinogenesis. Mutagen sensitivity, measured as sensitivity to bleomycin in peripheral blood lymphocytes, has been found to be increased in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is hypothesized to reflect cancer susceptibility. The aim of this study was to investigate whether mutagen sensitivity is influenced by oral N-acetylcysteine supplementation and can therefore be used as intermediate end point in chemoprevention. Patients (n = 19) who had various periods of N-acetylcysteine supplementation (600 mg daily for 3-9 months) were analyzed. In addition, a patient group (n = 14) that did not receive N-acetylcysteine supplementation was analyzed for comparison. Our results show no evidence that administration of N-acetylcysteine did influence the mutagen sensitivity level. The only explanatory variable in the analysis of the difference between two samples of one person was the b/c value of the first measurement. Moreover, the variability in these repeated measurements (coefficient of variation of 14%) indicates that additional studies should be performed to minimize this variability and to optimize the testing of mutagen sensitivity to accurately identify individual patients at high risk for the development of multiple primary tumors.

The sample consisted of 1210 nurse responses and 698 interviews of patients with pain during hospitalization at a major urban cancer center. The PMP provided a structure (standards), educational opportunities, and training in CQI methods. Outcome measures included a patient evaluation questionnaire and concerns checklist; nurse knowledge, attitude and barriers questionnaire; and focus groups to identify areas needing improvement. Significant improvements were found in patients' satisfaction, nurses' knowledge and attitude scores, and reductions in nurses' perceptions of barriers. Focus groups revealed the need for improved communication among disciplines about pain and better assessment of patients unable to self-report.

Women in the intervention group were nearly 3 times as likely to receive a mammogram (relative risk, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.75-4.73). The benefit persisted when analyzed by age; race, and prior screening behavior. This intervention was practice based, not dependent on visits, and enhanced the efficacy of an already successful computerized preventive care information system. Personalized education and case management are successful in enhancing compliance with breast cancer screening among historically noncompliant vulnerable urban women. This intervention, when combined with a preventive care information system, has the potential to achieve Healthy People 2000 objectives for breast cancer screening.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of supportive coaching as an intervention to enhance compliance with these breast cancer screening guidelines. The following research questions were identified: (a) what are the attitudes of women toward breast cancer screening? (b) what are the barriers to compliance identified by women in breast cancer screening? and (c) what are the effects of supportive interventions by a professional nurse and of compliance with breast cancer screening in women? A quasi-experimental design was used to study the research questions. The population chosen for the study included female employees in a state university setting. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. All participants were asked to complete a prestudy questionnaire measuring attitudes and beliefs, gathering demographic and health information, and surveying breast cancer screening practices. The experimental group then received coaching and supportive interventions over the course of the academic year. The remainder of the sample served as a control group. A poststudy questionnaire was then sent to the entire sample to identify behaviors related to breast cancer screening. A variety of beliefs and attitudes were observed in the groups. No significant difference was found between the experimental and control groups on compliance with mammography and the clinical breast examination.

A sample of 147 healthy women were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Pre- and post-test measures were obtained using a semi-structured interview, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Patient Satisfaction Tool. At pre-test, women had a low level of knowledge which increased significantly at post-test. The knowledge scores were slightly higher in women who received information supported by graphic or video colposcopy than in women who received standardized information without teaching aids. Compared to the CG, women in the IGs scored significantly higher on questions related to cervical cancer prevention. The level of satisfaction was significantly higher in women receiving video-supported information and graphic-supported information compared to women receiving information without teaching aids. The results indicated that visual teaching aids were effective: video colposcopy in increasing patient satisfaction with preventive health care; and graphic representation in improving knowledge regarding cancer screening.

504,173849,How reminders given to patients and physicians affected pap smear use in a health maintenance organization: results of a randomized controlled trial.,Cancer,9635532,"The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial that involved three sites of a health maintenance organization (HMO) serving an urban minority population. Their aim was to evaluate the impact of reminders given to patients and physicians on site visitation by patients and Pap smear use. Eligible women (n=5801) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention combinations (in which reminders were given to either the patient or the physician, to both, or to neither). If they were ineligible for patient reminder intervention, patients were randomized only to physician reminder intervention (the presence or absence of it). The letter of reminder mailed to the patient invited women due for Pap smears to visit the HMO site, and the reminder for physicians was a medical record notice that a Pap smear was due. Logistic and survival analyses were used to investigate the correlation of intervention status with visitation, interval of time to a visit, and Pap smear use. Reminders given to patients and physicians had a limited impact on visitation by patients to the HMO sites or Pap smear completion. Although some subgroups of women may benefit, the authors also observed a possibly unfavorable impact among other subgroups. These results emphasize the importance of identifying more effective interventions, targeting them to women most likely to benefit, and not overlooking the possibility that preventive intervention will have an unanticipated adverse effect. Despite its effectiveness as a method of controlling cervical carcinoma, the use of Pap smear testing remains incomplete, and its promotion in the primary care setting provides an important opportunity for intervention. In the primary intent-to-treat analysis, there was no significant effect of either patient or physician reminder interventions on rates of visitation or Pap smear completion. The secondary efficacy analyses demonstrated no overall effect of either patient or physician reminders, but effects among subgroups of women at individual HMO sites were noted. At Site 3, there was an apparent increase in time to the next visit among the subgroup of women with a chronic illness (16 weeks with intervention vs. 9 weeks without). With the physician reminder, the odds that a Pap smear would be given during the study year were increased among women without a previous Pap smear at Site 1 (adjusted odds ratio=1.39) and those with a chronic illness at Site 2 (adjusted odds ratio=3.38).

They were given Hangeshashin-to (TJ-14), a Kampo medicine, to prevent the occurrence of irinotecan-induced diarrhea. The authors studied the Kampo medicine's clinical usefulness in a randomised comparative trial. Subjects in the study comprised 41 non-resectable and untreated non-small cell lung cancer patients. A daily dosage of 7.5 g Hange shashin-to was divided into three portions, each of which was given to the subjects orally before each meal. The subjects began taking the medicine three or more days before the start of chemotherapy, and continued taking it more than 21 days after starting chemotherapy. A total of 18 patients received TJ-14, and 23 did not.

The mechanisms by which they exert cancer-preventive effects may involve modulation of estrogen synthesis and metabolism. To evaluate this hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone feeding study was performed in 12 healthy premenopausal women. The study consisted of three diet periods, each separated by a washout of approximately 3 weeks. Each diet period lasted for three menstrual cycles plus 9 days (averaging approximately 100 days), during which subjects consumed their habitual diets supplemented with soy protein powder providing 0.16 (control diet), 1.01, or 2.01 mg of total isoflavones per kg of body weight per day (10+/-1.1, 65+/-9.4, or 129+/-16 mg/day, respectively). A 72-h urine sample was collected during the midfollicular phase (days 7-9) of the fourth menstrual cycle in each diet period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids and lignans significantly increased with increased isoflavone consumption. Compared with the control diet, increased isoflavone consumption decreased urinary excretion of estradiol, estrone, estriol, and total estrogens, as well as excretion of the hypothesized genotoxic estrogen metabolites, 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestrone, and 4-hydroxyestradiol. Of importance are the observations of a significant increase in the 2-hydroxyestrone/16alpha-hydroxyestrone ratio and a decrease in the genotoxic/total estrogens ratio. These data suggest that soy isoflavone consumption may exert cancer-preventive effects by decreasing estrogen synthesis and altering metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.
