0,17578061,"To examine the potential impact of elderly age on response to participation in a structured, multidisciplinary quality-of-life (QOL) intervention for patients with advanced cancer undergoing radiation therapy.","Study design was a randomized stratified, two group, controlled clinical trial in the setting of a tertiary care comprehensive cancer center. Subjects with newly diagnosed cancer and an estimated 5-year survival rate of 0%-50% who required radiation therapy were recruited and randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a standard care group. The intervention consisted of eight 90-min sessions designed to address the five QOL domains of cognitive, physical, emotional, spiritual, and social functioning. QOL was measured using Spitzer uniscale and linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) at baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 27.","Of the 103 study participants, 33 were geriatric (65 years or older), of which 16 (mean age 72.4 years) received the intervention and 17 (mean age 71.4 years) were assigned to the standard medical care. The geriatric participants who completed the intervention had higher QOL scores at baseline, at week 4 and at week 8, compared to the control participants.","Our results demonstrate that geriatric patients with advanced cancer undergoing radiation therapy will benefit from participation in a structured multidisciplinary QOL intervention. Therefore, geriatric individuals should not be excluded from participating in a cancer QOL intervention, and, in fact, elderly age may be an indicator of strong response to a QOL intervention. Future research should further explore this finding."
1,29266524,Cognitive dysfunction associated with cancer is frequently reported and can reduce quality of life. This study evaluated a Web-based cognitive rehabilitation therapy program (eReCog) in cancer survivors compared with a waitlist control group.,"Adult cancer survivors with self-reported cognitive symptoms who had completed primary treatment at least 6\u00a0months prior were recruited. Participants completed telephone screening and were randomly allocated to the 4-week online intervention or waitlist. Primary outcome was perceived cognitive impairment assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function version 3. Secondary outcomes were additional measures of subjective cognitive functioning, objective cognitive functioning, and psychosocial variables.",Seventy-six women were allocated to the intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a040) or waitlist (n\u00a0=\u00a036). A significant interaction was found on the instrumental activities of daily living measure of self-reported prospective memory whereby the intervention group reported a greater reduction in prospective memory failures than the waitlist group. Interaction trends were noted on perceived cognitive impairments (P\u00a0=\u00a0.089) and executive functioning (P\u00a0=\u00a0.074). No significant interactions were observed on other measures of objective cognitive functioning or psychosocial variables.,The Web-based intervention shows promise for improving self-reported cognitive functioning in adult cancer survivors. Further research is warranted to better understand the mechanisms by which the intervention might contribute to improved self-reported cognition.
2,28708930,"Testicular cancer survivors (TCS) have an increased risk of treatment-related cardiovascular disease (CVD), which may limit their overall survival. We evaluated the effects of high-intensity aerobic interval training (HIIT) on traditional and novel CVD risk factors and surrogate markers of mortality in a population-based sample of TCS.","This phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02459132) randomly assigned 63 TCS to usual care (UC) or 12 weeks of supervised HIIT (ie, alternating periods of vigorous-intensity and light-intensity aerobic exercise). The primary outcome was peak aerobic fitness (VO ) assessed via a treadmill-based maximal cardiorespiratory exercise test. Secondary endpoints included CVD risk (eg, Framingham Risk Score), arterial health, parasympathetic nervous system function, and blood-based biomarkers.","Postintervention VO data were obtained for 61 participants (97%). HIIT participants attended 99% of the exercise sessions and achieved 98% of the target exercise intensity. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that HIIT was superior to UC for improving VO (adjusted between-group mean difference, 3.7\u2009mL O /kg/min; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-5.1 [P&lt;.001]) and multiple secondary outcomes including CVD risk (P\u2009=\u2009.011), arterial thickness (P&lt;.001), arterial stiffness (P&lt;.001), postexercise parasympathetic reactivation (P\u2009=\u2009.001), inflammation (P\u2009=\u2009.045), and low-density lipoprotein (P\u2009=\u2009.014). Overall, HIIT reduced the prevalence of modifiable CVD risk factors by 20% compared with UC.","This randomized trial provides the first evidence that HIIT improves cardiorespiratory fitness, multiple pathways of CVD risk, and surrogate markers of mortality in TCS. These findings have important implications for the management of TCS. Further research concerning the long-term effects of HIIT on CVD morbidity and mortality in TCS is warranted.

3,15454833,"An open-label, matched-pair (by diagnosis, stage of disease, age, and gender) pilot clinical trial was conducted to test whether the combined administration of the medical nutriment MSC (Avemar) with cytotoxic drugs and the continued administration of MSC on its own help to reduce the incidence of treatment-related febrile neutropenia in children with solid cancers compared with the same treatments without MSC.","Between December 1998 and May 2002, 22 patients (11 pairs) were enrolled in this study. At baseline, the staging of the tumors was the same in each pair (mostly pTNM = T2N0M0), with the exception of two cases in which patients in the MSC group had worse prognoses (metastasis at baseline). There were no significant differences in the average age of the patients, the length of treatment time (MSC) or follow-up, the number of patients with central venous catheters, the number of chemotherapy cycles, the frequency of preventive counterneutropenic interventions, or the type and dosage of antibiotic and antipyretic therapy used in the two groups.","During the treatment (follow-up) period, there was no progression of the malignant disease, whereas at end-point the number and frequency of febrile neutropenic events significantly differed between the two groups: 30 febrile neutropenic episodes (24.8%) in the MSC group versus 46 (43.4%) in the control group (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P &lt; 0.05).",The continuous supplementation of anticancer therapies with the medical nutriment MSC helps to reduce the incidence of treatment-related febrile neutropenia in children with solid cancers.
4,16353199,"Calcium and vitamin D are chemopreventive agents for colorectal neoplasia. Studies of the effects of calcium and vitamin D on early surrogate markers of reduced risk, such as proliferation, have been limited to evaluation of the flat colorectal mucosa. Biologic changes that may occur in colorectal adenomas after chemopreventive regimens have not been reported.","In the current study, adenomatous polyps were transected, approximately 50% were removed for histologic examination, and the remnants tattooed before the administration of either calcium carbonate (1500 mg 3 times daily) plus vitamin D(3) 400 IU or a placebo for 6 months. At study end, polyp remnants were resected completely and were used for histologic examination. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in both flat mucosa and in polyp tissue. Proliferation was assessed by MIB-1 staining; apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling, BAK, and Bcl-2 staining; and cytokeratin AE1, vitamin D receptor, MUC5AC mucin, and galectin-3 were assessed by immunohistochemistry.","Nineteen patients, including 11 patients in the treatment group and 8 patients in the control group, completed the study. Proliferative indices fell both in flat mucosa and in polyps in the treatment group, and there were no significant changes in the control group. Apoptosis and Bcl-2 immunostaining were unchanged in both groups, but the frequency of BAK-immunostained cells in the interior of polyps rose significantly. Vitamin D receptor staining increased slightly and significantly in flat rectal tissue in the treatment group. There were no significant changes in galectin-3 staining, but a striking reduction in MUC5AC mucin staining in polyps was observed after treatment with calcium plus vitamin D.",The administration of a calcium plus vitamin D chemopreventive regimen resulted in several changes in adenomatous tissue that may have contributed to reduced polyp formation.
5,29086085,"A home-based, low-intensity physical activity program (Onco-Move) and a supervised, moderate-to-high intensity, combined resistance and aerobic exercise program (OnTrack) have proven to be effective in maintaining physical fitness and reducing fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. This study evaluated the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of Onco-Move and OnTrack.","A total of 230 patients were randomized to Onco-Move, OnTrack, or usual care (UC). Health outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), general and physical fatigue, and physical fitness measured at baseline, end of chemotherapy, and 6-month follow-up. Societal costs included professional and informal health care, work absenteeism, and unpaid productivity costs. Cost data were based on 3-monthly questionnaires, supplemented by medication data obtained from pharmacies.","Onco-Move is not likely to be cost-effective due to the relatively high willingness-to-pay necessary to reach reasonable probabilities of cost-effectiveness (QALY, general and physical fatigue). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for OnTrack compared to UC were \u20ac26,916/QALY, \u20ac788/1-point decrease in general fatigue and \u20ac1402/1-point decrease in physical fatigue. The probability of OnTrack being cost-effective ranged from 31% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of \u20ac0-79% at a WTP of \u20ac80,000/QALY, 97% at a WTP of \u20ac15,000/1-point decrease in general fatigue, and 86% at a WTP of \u20ac24,000/1-point decrease in physical fatigue. Both interventions had a low probability of being cost-effective for physical fitness. The probability of cost-effectiveness for both interventions was greater among compliant participants.","Onco-Move is not likely to be cost-effective. Depending on the decision-makers' willingness-to-pay, OnTrack could be considered cost-effective in comparison with UC.

6,19341012,"A plethora of research now exists documenting the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients; however, no studies have been conducted with people diagnosed with hepatobiliary carcinoma.","A total of 28 patients agreed to participate in the study in which 14 patients were randomized to the intervention arm of the study and 14 patients to an attention-standard of care arm. Evaluation of the benefits of the intervention was performed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep), the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) to assess anxiety, peripheral blood leukocytes to measure immune system modulation, and survival.","Results indicate that patients who were randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the study reported clinically, but not statistically, significant improvements on symptoms of depression and anxiety, disease-related symptoms and treatment side effects, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and modest improvements in peripheral blood leukocytes and survival when compared with the standard of care group.","The findings of this study suggest that the individually tailored intervention was feasible and preliminary data suggested that the intervention may improve patients' HRQL, mood, and had modest improvements in immune system functioning and survival. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to test the statistical significance and generalizability of the individually tailored intervention."
7,25567329,"The aim of the study was to compare the effects of aerobic exercise training and yoga on the functional capacity, peripheral muscle strength, quality of life (QOL), and fatigue in breast cancer survivors.","A total of 52 patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: aerobic exercise (n = 28) and yoga added to aerobic exercise (n = 24). Both groups participated in submaximal exercise 30 minutes/d, 3 d/wk for 6 weeks. The second group participated in a 1-hour yoga program in addition to aerobic exercise training. Functional capacity was assessed by the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Peripheral muscle strength was evaluated with a hand-held dynamometer. The fatigue severity level was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The QOL was determined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire.","There were statistically significant increases in peripheral muscle strength, the 6MWT distance, and the perception of QOL in both groups (P &lt; .05). Additionally, the group with aerobic exercise and yoga showed marked improvement compared with the aerobic exercise group in fatigue perception (P &lt; .05).","According to the data from this study, aerobic exercise training and yoga improved the functional capacity and QOL of breast cancer patients. Aerobic exercise programs can be supported by body mind techniques, such as yoga, in the rehabilitation of cancer patients for improving functional recovery and psychosocial wellness."
8,18381369,"Fatigue is a relevant problem of cancer patients during and after treatment. Several studies have shown that exercise can improve quality of life and functional status of cancer patients undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy. However, there is a lack of information about the effects of this intervention on persistent cancer-related fatigue. Therefore, we assessed the effects of an exercise program on cancer-related fatigue after treatment.","A consecutive series of 32 cancer patients with mild to severe persistent fatigue [scores on the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) &gt; 25] participated in a 3-week exercise program consisting of endurance (30 min walking on a treadmill) and resistance/coordination exercises for the major muscle groups. Fatigue, mood, and anxiety were assessed with questionnaires and physical performance with a stress test before and after the program.","At the end of the program, we observed a significant increase of physical performance (workload at the anaerobic threshold pre 61 +/- 26 W, post 78 +/- 31 W, P &lt; 0.0001) and reduction of global fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: pre 45.7 +/- 13.4, post 52.6 +/- 12.4, P &lt; 0.0001; BFI: pre 37.9 +/- 18.3, post 31.2 +/-17.1, P &lt; 0.001). However, no significant improvement of cognitive fatigue or reduction of anxiety was observed.","A 3-week exercise program leads to a substantial improvement of physical performance and reduction of mental and physical fatigue in cancer patients after treatment. However, this intervention does not affect depression, anxiety, or cognitive fatigue."
9,11197251,"Dietary folate intake is inversely associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. This study investigated the effect of folate supplementation on genomic DNA methylation and DNA strand breaks in exons 5-8 of the p53 gene of the colonic mucosa, two provisional biomarkers of colon cancer.","Twenty subjects with adenomas were randomized to receive either folate (5 mg/day) or placebo for 1 yr after polypectomy. At baseline, 6 months and 1 yr, systemic and colonic measures of folate status were determined, as were the biomarkers mentioned earlier.","Folate supplementation increased serum, red blood cell and colonic mucosal folate concentrations (p &lt; 0.02). Folate supplementation also increased the extent of genomic DNA methylation at 6 months and 1 yr (p = 0.001), whereas placebo administration was associated with an increase in the extent of genomic DNA methylation only at 1 yr. Similarly, folate supplementation decreased the extent of p53 strand breaks in exons 5-8 at 6 months and 1 yr (p &lt; 0.02), whereas placebo administration was associated with a decrease in the extent of p53 strand breaks only at 1 yr.","Both of these provisional biomarkers of colon cancer underwent accelerated improvement at 6 months with folate supplementation. However, these markers also improved with placebo at 1 yr. Therefore, potential confounding factors that seem to modulate these biomarkers need to be identified and corrected in order for these markers to serve as suitable surrogate endpoints in folate chemoprevention trials."
10,23730723,Physical activity (PA) has been shown to provide health benefits for breast cancer patients. The effects of augmenting oncology health care provider (HCP) advice for PA with 3 months of telephone counseling versus contact control were evaluated in a randomized trial.,"After receiving brief HCP advice to become physically active, 192 women (age in years: M = 60.0, SD = 9.9) who had completed treatment for Stage 0-IV breast cancer were randomized to telephone counseling to support PA (n = 106) or contact control (n = 86). Their PA, motivational readiness, fatigue, and physical functioning were assessed at baseline (before receiving HCP advice), 3, 6, and 12 months.","Telephone counseling produced significant effects on the primary outcome of moderate-intensity PA of about 30 min/week at both 3 months (95% CI = 0.44, 57.32) and 6 months (95% CI = 3.06, 61.26). Intervention participants were also more than twice as likely as control participants to report improvements in achieving PA guidelines of at least 150 min/week at 3 (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.18, 4.98) and 6 months (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.00-4.48). Telephone counseling was significantly more effective than contact control in increasing motivational readiness for PA at all follow-ups (ORs = 3.93-6.28, all ps &lt;.003). No between-groups differences were found for fatigue, while differential improvements in physical functioning did not remain significant past 3 months (p = .01).","HCP advice plus telephone counseling improved PA among breast cancer patients at 3 and 6 months and also differentially improved patients' motivational readiness at all follow-ups, suggesting the potential for exercise promotion in cancer follow-up care."
11,17575569,This study aimed to assess the impact on physicians' detection of patients' and relatives' distress of six 3-h consolidation workshops (CW) following a 2.5-day communication skills basic training (BT) program and to investigate factors associated with detection of distress.,"Physicians, after BT, were randomized to CW or to a waiting list. Physicians' detection of patients' and relatives' distress was measured through differences between physicians' ratings of patients' and relatives' distress (VAS) and patients' and relatives' self-reported distress (HADS). Communication skills were analysed according to the CRCWEM.","Mixed-effects modelling of physicians' detection of patients' distress showed a positive group by time effect in favour of physicians in the CW group. Detection of patients' distress was associated negatively with patients' distress, positively with physicians' concurrent use of psychological assessment and supportive skills, and negatively with general assessment skills. Mixed-effects modelling of physicians' detection of relatives' distress showed no significant group by time effect. Detection of relatives' distress was associated negatively with relatives' distress and with general assessment skills.",CW following a 2.5-day BT are needed to improve physicians' detection of patients' distress in three-person interviews. Results indicate the need to further improve physicians' detection of relatives' distress.
12,24448757,"Evaluating the role of cystone, a polyherbal preparation, in protecting cancer patients against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, and its impact on the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin.","A prospective open-label randomized controlled trial conducted on 49 cancer patients who received six cycles of 70 mg/m(2) cisplatin-based regimens. The study comprised two groups, a control group (A) in which 28 patients received cisplatin without cystone supplement, and an experimental group (B) in which 21 patients received cisplatin with cystone supplement. Renal function parameters including serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, blood urea, and serum cystatin C were compared between both groups throughout chemotherapy cycles. Patient response to treatment was evaluated in both groups after 3rd and 6th cycles.","At the end of the study, mean levels of serum creatinine, blood urea, and serum cystatin C were significantly lower, whereas creatinine clearance was significantly higher in group (B) compared with group (A). In group (B), there was no significant difference between mean levels of renal markers at baseline and after completion of treatment; while significant changes were observed in group (A). Grading of acute kidney injury according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events revealed significantly better renal status among patients in group (B) &quot;grades 0 and 1 in 76 and 24 % of the patients, respectively&quot; compared with group (A) &quot;grades 0, 1, and 2 in 36, 32, and 32 % of the patients, respectively&quot;. Based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, there was no significant difference between both groups.",Cystone can protect cancer patients from cisplatin nephrotoxicity without interfering with its antitumor activity.
13,7651642,"To determine whether a clinic-based intervention, consisting of motivational brochures and a tracking system, increases adherence to recommendations for treatment in women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears.","Three pairs of clinics--two family planning clinics, two family practice clinics, and two dysplasia clinics--were randomized within pairs either to provide the intervention or to maintain usual contact procedures with women having abnormal Papanicolaou smears. Baseline adherence rates were assessed through chart review during 3 randomly selected months of the previous year. Intervention clinics received the tracking system and motivational brochures, which were sent to women on notification of their cervical abnormalities. Comparison clinics also used the tracking system but did not include the brochures when notifying women of their abnormalities. Adherence rates were assessed prospectively for approximately 100 consecutive nonpregnant women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears (inflammatory benign atypia, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I, II, or III) at each clinic.","Within clinics, baseline adherence rates ranged from 34-69% for atypia and 33-88% for dysplasia. For dysplasia patients, the overall analysis indicated a significant increase in adherence for the intervention clinics (P = .03); however, for atypia patients, the observed difference was not statistically significant (P = .23). Extensive analyses of the data from family planning clinics indicated that women receiving the intervention were more likely to obtain follow-up treatment (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.15-5.85). There was a suggestion that the intervention could have a greater effect among African-American women (OR 15.7) compared with white women (OR 1.8) (P = .09). White women, those with dysplasia, nonsmokers, and nulliparas were most likely to adhere to treatment recommendations.",A motivational brochure can enhance adherence to treatment recommendations among women with abnormal Papanicolaou smears. Future studies should focus on techniques for enhancing adherence among more resistant participants.
14,28597253,"Oral agents for cancer treatment are increasingly prescribed due to their benefits. However, oral cancer medications are difficult to handle and have a considerable potential for side effects. This type of therapy requires a high level of self-management competence by the patient. A standardized patient education program provided by physicians and oncology nurses may positively influence the handling of oral agents. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a standardized patient education program provided by specially trained oncology nurses on therapy management regarding side effects and unplanned therapy interruptions.","One hundred sixty-five patients from 28 office-based oncology practices from all over Germany participated in this cluster-randomized controlled study. Patients of both intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a0111) and standard care groups (n\u00a0=\u00a054) received the usual oncologist counseling; in addition, the patients from the intervention group (k\u00a0=\u00a017 practices) received an education from specially trained oncology nurses. The time of observation was 3\u00a0months per patient.","The patients of the intervention group reported fewer side effects (skin rash, pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting). Patients in the standard care group interrupted the therapy more frequently without informing their oncologist, compared to the intervention group.",Patients benefit from a standardized patient education program provided by specially trained oncology nurses. They tend to handle side effects and critical situations better.
15,16030104,"Evidence of the chemopreventive effects of the dietary antioxidants alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and l-selenomethionine (selenium) comes from secondary analysis of two phase III clinical trials that found treatment with these antioxidants reduced the incidence of prostate cancer. To determine the effects of selenium and vitamin E in blood and prostate tissue, we undertook a preoperative feasibility study complementary to the currently ongoing Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial.","Forty-eight patients with clinically localized prostate cancer enrolled on this 2 x 2 factorial design study were randomized to take selenium, vitamin E, both, or placebo for 3 to 6 weeks before prostatectomy. Sera were collected from patients before and after dietary supplementation. Thirty-nine patients were evaluable, and 29 age-matched disease-free men served as controls. Mass profiling of lipophilic serum proteins of lower molecular weight (2-13.5 kDa) was conducted, and mass spectra data were analyzed using custom-designed software.",Weighted voting analyses showed a change in sera classification from cancerous to healthy for some patients with prostate cancer after dietary intervention. ANOVA analysis showed significantly different treatment effects on prediction strength changes among the four groups at a 95% confidence level. Eliminating an outlying value and performing post hoc analysis using Fisher's least significant difference method showed that effects in the group treated with the combination were significantly different from those of the other groups.,"In sera from patients with prostate cancer, selenium and vitamin E combined induced statistically significant proteomic pattern changes associated with prostate cancer-free status."
16,16130584,To investigate the potential efficacy of bowel cancer prevention messages in increasing intentions to be more physically active.,"A convenience sample of 281 physically inactive persons aged 30-60 years was recruited in the Perth city centre and randomly assigned to a bowel cancer and physical activity message or a heart disease and physical activity message. After reading a booklet containing information about physical activity and its link either to bowel cancer (n = 141) or cardiovascular disease (n = 140), respondents filled in a self-completion questionnaire. The main response measures were impact on intentions to be more physically active, and perceived believability and relevance of the message.","Perceived believability of the message was high in both conditions. Perceived personal relevance of the message was substantially lower in the bowel cancer than the cardiovascular disease condition. Overall, the cardiovascular disease condition achieved somewhat higher behavioural intentions than the bowel cancer condition.",The finding that two in three respondents in the bowel cancer condition had increased intention to increase their level of physical activity provides support for the potential efficacy of promoting physical activity in reducing the risk of bowel cancer.
17,11380221,Xerostomia is a frequent and potentially debilitating toxicity of radiotherapy (XRT) for cancers of the head and neck. This report describes the use of acupuncture as palliation for such patients.,"Eighteen patients with xerostomia refractory to pilocarpine therapy after XRT for head and neck malignancy were offered acupuncture as palliation. All patients are without evidence of cancer recurrence at the primary site. Acupuncture was provided to three auricular points and one digital point bilaterally, with electrostimulation used variably. The Xerostomia Inventory (XI) was administered retrospectively to provide an objective measure of efficacy.",Acupuncture contributed to relief from xerostomia to varying degrees. Palliative effect as measured by the XI varied from nil to robust (pre- minus post- therapy values of over 20 points). Nine patients had benefit of over 10 points on the XI.,Acupuncture reduces xerostomia in some patients who are otherwise refractory to best current management.
18,30464699,"Physical function is important for defining treatment strategies in patients with cancer and can be estimated using patient-reported outcomes (pros). Although pros are subjective, physical activity and fitness can be tested objectively with adequate, but more labour-intensive methods that are rarely used in daily clinical practice. To determine whether pros for physical function (pro-pf) accurately predict physical function, we studied their interrelationships with objective measures of physical activity and fitness in patients with cancer who had completed cancer treatment, including adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or autologous stem-cell transplantation.","Baseline data from the react (Resistance and Endurance Exercise After Chemotherapy) and exist (Exercise Intervention After Stem-Cell Transplantation) studies were evaluated. In those studies, the effects of an exercise intervention on physical fitness, fatigue, and health-related quality of life in patients with cancer shortly after completion of chemotherapy or stem-cell transplantation were studied. Interrelationships between pro-pf (physical function subscale of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-question core Quality of Life Questionnaire), physical activity (accelerometer), and cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen uptake) were assessed using univariable and multivariable multilevel linear mixed-model analyses.","After adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index, the pro-pf was significantly associated with physical activity (\u03b2 = 1.75; 95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 2.42) and cardiorespiratory fitness (\u03b2 = 0.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.06 to 0.13). Standardized coefficients were 0.28 and 0.26 respectively, indicating a weak association.","The pro-pf is only weakly associated with objective physical activity and fitness evaluation in patients after curative treatment for cancer. The pro-pf cannot, therefore, be used in clinical practice as a substitute for objective measures of physical function."
19,28832310,Shared decision making (SDM) is widely encouraged by both the American Urological Association and Choosing Wisely for prostate cancer screening. Implementation of SDM is challenging secondary to time constraints and competing patient priorities. One strategy to mitigate the difficulties in implementing SDM is to utilize a decision aid (DA). Here we evaluate whether a DA improves a patient's prostate cancer knowledge and affects prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening rates.,"Patients were randomized to usual care (UC), DA, or DA + SDM. Perception of quality of care was measured using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. Outcomes were stratified by long term provider relationship (LTPR, &gt; 3 years) versus short term provider relationship (STPR, &lt; 3 years). Knowledge of prostate cancer screening and the decision regarding screening were assessed. Groups were compared using ANOVA and logistic regression models.","A total of 329 patients were randomized. Patients in the DA + SDM arm were significantly more likely to report discussing the implication of screening (33% DA + SDM, 22% UC, 16% DA, p = 0.0292) and answered significantly more knowledge questions correctly compared to the UC arm (5.03 versus 4.46, p = 0.046). However, those in the DA arm were significantly less likely to report that they always felt encouraged to discuss all health concerns (72% DA, 78% DA + SDM, 87% UC, p = 0.0285). Interestingly, STPR patients in the DA arm were significantly more likely to undergo PSA-based prostate cancer screening (41%) than the UC arm (8%, p = 0.019). This effect was not observed in the LTPR group.","Providing patients a DA without a personal interaction resulted in a greater chance of undergoing PSA-based screening without improving knowledge about screening or understanding of the consequences of this decision. This effect was exacerbated by a shorter term provider relationship. With complex issues such as the decision to pursue PSA-based prostate cancer screening, tools cannot substitute for direct interaction with a trusted provider."
20,8602179,"Observational studies suggest that people who consume more fruits and vegetables containing beta carotene have somewhat lower risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease, and earlier basic research suggested plausible mechanisms. Because large randomized trials of long duration were necessary to test this hypothesis directly, we conducted a trial of beta carotene supplementation.","In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of beta carotene (50 mg on alternate days), we enrolled 22,071 male physicians, 40 to 84 years of age, in the United States; 11 percent were current smokers and 39 percent were former smokers at the beginning of the study in 1982. By December 31, 1995, the scheduled end of the study, fewer than 1 percent had been lost to follow-up, and compliance was 78 percent in the group that received beta carotene.","Among 11,036 physicians randomly assigned to receive beta carotene and 11,035 assigned to receive placebo, there were virtually no early or late differences in the overall incidence of malignant neoplasms or cardiovascular disease, or in overall mortality. In the beta carotene group, 1273 men had any malignant neoplasm (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), as compared with 1293 in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.98; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.06). There were also no significant differences in the number of cases of lung cancer (82 in the beta carotene group vs. 88 in the placebo group); the number of deaths from cancer (386 vs. 380), deaths from any cause (979 vs. 968), or deaths from cardiovascular disease (338 vs. 313); the number of men with myocardial infarction (468 vs. 489); the number with stroke (367 vs. 382); or the number with any one of the previous three end points (967 vs. 972). Among current and former smokers, there were also no significant early or late differences in any of these end points.","In this trial among healthy men, 12 years of supplementation with beta carotene produced neither benefit nor harm in terms of the incidence of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular disease, or death from all causes."
21,27212181,"Breast fibroadenoma is a common finding in young women and actually accounts for the majority of benign breast lumps. Fibroadenoma does not require any treatment unless clinical symptoms (mostly mastalgia) or histological markers of cancer risk (atypia) impose specific medical or surgical intervention. In symptomatic fibroadenoma, anti-estrogenic treatments provided evidence of success. Yet, these therapies are often associated with relevant side effects that lead to drug treatment discontinuation. Additionally, in such cases, relapse is a frequent issue. Therefore, an optimal strategy is still warranted. Boswellia, betaine and myo-inositol have already been proved to modulate different pathways - inflammatory, metabolic, oxidative and endocrine processes - in a wide array of human tissues. Based on that background, we hypothesized that these substances can effectively synergize in inducing the regression of fibroadenoma.","We included 64 patients \u2264 30 years of age with fibroadenoma. The patients were randomized into two groups. The experimental group was treated with an association of Boswellia, betaine, myo-inositol, B-group vitamins and N-acetylcysteine for 6 months; otherwise, the placebo group was treated only with B-group vitamins and N-acetylcysteine. Patients were monitored at the enrollment and the end of the study for evaluating the clinical response.","A significant clinical improvement was observed in the experimental arm. Fibroadenoma median volume reduction averaged 17.86% in the experimental group and 5.96% in the placebo group. Moreover, 14 out of 36 (38.88%) patients showed a reduction of fibroadenoma volume compared to 5/28 (17.85%) observed in the placebo group (p = 0.005).","A supplementation with Boswellia, betaine and myo-inositol reduces fibroadenoma dimension in young women. No relevant side effects have been recorded."
22,14503054,"To observe the effect of Weichang'an (WCA, a Chinese preparation) in preventing post-operative metastasis of progressive stage of gastric cancer.","A prospective randomized, controlled study was conducted by dividing the 148 patients of progressive staged gastric cancer after radical operation into the WCA group, the chemotherapy (CT) group and the WCA + CT group, to observe the survival rate, metastasis rate, quality of life (QOF) and tumor-bearing survival time after relapse (TST) in patients.","The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rate after operation in the WCA + CT group was 89.51%, 69.77% and 55.76% respectively, which was significantly higher than that in the CT group (83.86%, 59.33% and 49.43%) respectively (P &lt; 0.05), but showed insignificant difference as compared with that in the WCA group (93.23%, 79.34% and 71.78%). Only 1-year metastasis in the WCA group was 15.25%, and in the WCA + CT group was 15.52%, the two were significantly lower than that in the CT group (35.48%, P &lt; 0.05). But the comparison of 2-year metastasis rate among the 3 groups (28.81%, 41.38% and 45.16%) and 3-year metastasis rate among them (33.90%, 46.55% and 51.61%) were insignificantly different. The QOF and TST were markedly better in the WCA group than those in the CT group.",WCA has preventive effect on relapse and metastasis in post-operational gastric cancer patients.
23,30613055,The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of integrated psychoeducational program for distress management of newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer.,"A quasi-experimental trial was conducted. The participants consisted of 47 female patients with breast cancer assigned to an intervention group (n=25) and control group (n=22). The intervention group participated in integrated psychoeducational program, consisting of individual face-to-face education and telephone-delivered health-coaching sessions. Data were collected at three time points: pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), and 6-month follow-up (T3). Study instruments were Distress thermometer, Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form 34 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast.","Compared with the control group, breast cancer patients in the intervention group reported lower distress and supportive care needs than the control group. The intervention group reported higher quality of life (QOL) overall and higher emotional well-being than the control group.",These findings indicate that the integrated psychoeducational program is an effective intervention for reducing distress and supportive care needs and increasing QOL of newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer. Oncology nurses need to provide psychoeducational intervention to support patients with breast cancer in managing their distress and helping them adjust to their life.
24,19058068,Diagnosis of ovarian cancer often portends a poor prognosis with significant quality-of-life (QOL) concerns.,"We report on a pilot study that tested the feasibility of a structured, ovarian cancer psychoeducational intervention (OCPI). Patients (N = 33) were randomly assigned to either the control or OCPI study arms in which those in the intervention arm received 4 sequential, structured, in-person educational sessions. Data were collected at the time of accrual and at 1 and 3 months postaccrual.",This study demonstrated the feasibility of a structured psychoeducational program in an outpatient clinical setting.,Study findings underscore the importance of developing interventions that address the 4 QOL domains impacted by ovarian cancer and support initiating a comprehensive psychoeducational intervention earlier in the course of illness.
25,25050872,"We developed a specific cognitive-existential intervention to improve existential distress in nonmetastatic cancer patients. The present study reports the feasibility of implementing and evaluating this intervention, which involved 12 weekly sessions in both individual and group formats, and explores the efficacy of the intervention on existential and global quality of life (QoL) measures.","Some 33 nonmetastatic cancer patients were randomized between the group intervention, the individual intervention, and the usual condition of care. Evaluation of the intervention on the existential and global QoL of patients was performed using the existential well-being subscale and the global scale of the McGill Quality of Life (MQoL) Questionnaire.","All participants agreed that their participation in the program helped them deal with their illness and their personal life. Some 88.9% of participants agreed that this program should be proposed for all cancer patients, and 94.5% agreed that this intervention helped them to reflect on the meaning of their life. At post-intervention, both existential and psychological QoL improved in the group intervention versus usual care (p = 0.086 and 0.077, respectively). At the three-month follow-up, global and psychological QoL improved in the individual intervention versus usual care (p = 0.056 and 0.047, respectively).","This pilot study confirms the relevance of the intervention and the feasibility of the recruitment and randomization processes. The data strongly suggest a potential efficacy of the intervention for existential and global quality of life, which will have to be confirmed in a larger study."
26,16189949,"As they reach menopause, a majority of women living in Westernized countries experience climacteric symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been used to remediate these symptoms. Recent studies, however, have suggested that HRT may increase the risk of developing breast cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, many women are looking for alternative treatment options.","This trial was a pilot study to assess the effect of a nutritional supplement containing isoflavones from kudzu and red clover, along with other targeted nutrients on menopausal symptoms and markers of breast cancer and CVD risk. Twenty-five menopausal women suffering from severe hot flushes and night sweats completed a 12-week intervention using this combination isoflavone nutritional supplement.","We observed a 46% decrease in reported hot flushes, from an average of 9.7 to 5.2 per day. Quality of life, as assessed by the standardized Greene Questionnaire, showed similar improvement. Two markers of CVD risk, the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and homocysteine, showed modest improvement. A proposed marker of breast cancer risk, the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone, also showed a statistically significant improvement.","The results of this pilot trial suggests that this combination isoflavone nutritional supplement may significantly relieve the most troubling symptoms of menopause, as well as confer some chemopreventive and cardioprotective benefits."
27,12576840,We performed a pilot trial to assess the response of lower urinary tract symptoms and prostate specific antigen (PSA) to acupuncture in a population of patients biopsy negative for prostate cancer.,"A total of 30 patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups, including observation for 3 months with 6 blood samples for PSA at set intervals, 9 sessions of acupuncture in 3 months to points of the kidney-bladder distinct meridian expected to treat the prostate with 6 blood samples for PSA at set intervals and 9 sessions of acupuncture in 3 months to points not expected to treat the prostate with 6 blood samples for PSA at set intervals. The effect of acupuncture on lower urinary tract symptoms was assessed monthly using the International Prostate Symptom Score.","Trend analysis (repeated measures ANOVA) revealed no significant changes in the 3-month period in the randomized arms. Statistical analysis showed p = 0.063 for the International Prostate Symptom Score, p = 0.945 for PSA and p = 0.37 for the free-to-total PSA ratio.",Acupuncture to the kidney-bladder distinct meridian neither relieves lower urinary tract symptoms nor impacts PSA.
28,16832795,"Identifying high-risk individuals for melanoma education and risk reduction may be a viable strategy to curb the incidence of melanoma, which has risen precipitously in the past 50 years. The first-degree relatives of melanoma patients represent a risk group who may experience a 'teachable moment' for enhanced education and risk reduction.","We report a randomized trial testing an intervention that provided personalized telephone counseling and individually tailored materials to siblings of recently-diagnosed melanoma patients. The purpose of this study was to test whether an intervention could lead to improvements in siblings' skin cancer risk reduction practices. Intervention condition participants received the following: (1) an initial motivational and goal-setting telephone intervention session delivered by the health educator; (2) three sets of computer-generated materials specifically tailored to individual responses from the baseline survey; (3) three telephone counseling sessions with the health educator, timed to follow receipt of the mailed materials; and (4) linkages to free screening programs. Families in the usual care arm received the suggestion from the physician that patients diagnosed with melanoma notify the family members about their diagnosis and encourage the family members to be screened.","494 siblings were recruited to the study and 403 siblings remained in the study through at least 6 months. At 12 months, intervention siblings were more likely to examine all moles, including those on the back (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.91). Compared with baseline, the number of participants in both groups that had received a skin cancer examination more than doubled, with no differences between groups. At 12 months, two-thirds of siblings in both groups reported routine use of sunscreen, but there were no differences in change over baseline between the two groups.","This study is the one of the first, to our knowledge, to address skin cancer risk-reduction strategies in a sample of individuals who have a recent family diagnosis of melanoma. Diagnosis of melanoma in a family member provides an important opportunity to intervene with others in that family. The components of the intervention may provide a useful foundation for future efforts to target the more than half million siblings at risk for melanoma, a lethal but preventable disease."
29,11440064,Physicians may not realize that some of their patients have limited reading abilities. The AMC Cancer Research Center and the Primary Care Curriculum at the University of Colorado collaborated to develop and implement a project to teach medical students to identify and effectively communicate with limited-literacy patients regarding cancer screening.,"The project incorporated two standardized-patient (SP) cases on cancer screening and literacy into the existing curriculum for second-year students. A small-group, interactive problem-based learning (PBL) case on breast cancer screening and literacy introduced the concept of communicating about cancer screening and literacy issues. A clinical practice examination on colorectal cancer screening and literacy was given at the end of the year.","The collaborative project proved successful in incorporating literacy and cancer screening into a medical school curriculum. Time spent training SPs to play the role of adults with limited literacy was very important, as was time spent pre-testing the cases. The PBL case effectively promoted group discussion of cancer screening and literacy.",The project succeeded in making students aware of literacy and cancer screening issues. Outcome results are being analyzed.

Men at all 14 sites were given a pre- and post-test questionnaire.","Of the 835 pre-test and 835 post-test questionnaires distributed, 518 (62.0 per cent) and 356 (42.6 per cent) were respectively returned for evaluation. In the intervention group, the median total knowledge score increased from three points (interquartile range: 2,4) at baseline to four points (interquartile range: 2,4) at post-test. However, no statistically significant change was observed in the control group. Post-intervention, the percentage of test participants examining their testicles regularly increased from 58.4 per cent to 68.3 per cent, while levels among control peers did not significantly alter.",This evaluation highlights the potential of using a low-cost initiative which targets innovative venues to improve men's knowledge of testicular cancer and rates of self-examination. Longer-term follow-up may be required to determine whether such increases are sustained.
31,10937002,"This study assessed whether the Learn, Share &amp; Live breast cancer education program resulted in favorable, replicable, and sustainable outcomes.",The program was implemented at index (year 1) and replication (year 2) sites. Baseline interviews (year 1; n = 240) and 2 follow-up telephone interviews (years 2 and 3; n = 337 and 323) were used to assess postintervention changes.,"From baseline to year 2, mammography adherence and stage of adoption improved at the index site relative to the replication site. Knowledge scores and percentages of respondents reporting that a friend had spoken with them about mammography improved significantly. Improvements were sustained through year 3 (2 years postintervention). In year 3, replication participants showed improvements in regard to knowledge and perceived mammography benefits, and there was a trend toward increased adherence. Site differences in postintervention adherence may have stemmed from respective choices of follow-up activities.","The study outcomes affirm the impact of Learn, Share &amp; Live, indicating a replicated and sustained program effect. Future studies should continue longer follow-up and explore the importance of providing mammography opportunities along with education."
32,29129894,"In Japan, the rate of cervical cancer screening is remarkably low, especially among women in their twenties and thirties, when cervical cancer is now increasing dramatically. The aim of this study was to test whether a modified government reminder for 20-year-old women to engage in cervical cancer screening, acting through maternal education and by asking for a maternal recommendation to the daughter to receive the screening, could increase their participation rate.","In two Japanese cities, 20-year-old girls who had not received their first cervical cancer screening before October of fiscal year 2014 were randomized into two study arms. One group of 1,274 received only a personalized daughter-directed reminder leaflet for cervical cancer screening. In the second group of 1,274, the daughters and their mothers received a combination package containing the same reminder leaflet as did the first group, plus an additional informational leaflet for the mother, which requested that the mother recommend that her daughter undergo cervical cancer screening. The subsequent post-reminder screening rates of these two study arms were compared.","The cervical cancer screening rate of 20-year-old women whose mothers received the information leaflet was significantly higher than that for women who received only a leaflet for themselves (11% vs 9%, P = 0.0049).","An intervention with mothers, by sending them a cervical cancer information leaflet with a request that they recommend that their daughter receive cervical cancer screening, significantly improved their daughters' screening rate."
33,12737857,"Although dietary fibre has been reported to have no association with colorectal adenoma and cancer, in some studies this topic remains controversial.","We used a 137-item food frequency questionnaire to assess the relation of fibre intake and frequency of colorectal adenoma. The study was done within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, a randomised controlled trial designed to investigate methods for early detection of cancer. In our analysis, we compared fibre intake of 33971 participants who were sigmoidoscopy-negative for polyps, with 3591 cases with at least one histologically verified adenoma in the distal large bowel (ie, descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum). Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression analysis.","High intakes of dietary fibre were associated with a lower risk of colorectal adenoma, after adjustment for potential dietary and non-dietary risk factors. Participants in the highest quintile of dietary fibre intake had a 27% (95% CI 14-38, p(trend)=0.002) lower risk of adenoma than those in the lowest quintile. The inverse association was strongest for fibre from grains and cereals and from fruits. Risks were similar for advanced and non-advanced adenoma. Risk of rectal adenoma was not significantly associated with fibre intake.","Dietary fibre, particularly from grains, cereals, and fruits, was associated with decreased risk of distal colon adenoma."

Forty-one women were randomized to a 6-month intervention: telemedicine with Wi-Fi scales, text messaging (texting), or enhanced usual care (EUC). Changes in anthropometrics and psychosocial measures were analyzed.","One-third of survey participants lacked awareness that obesity increased the risk of EC, and 40% misclassified their body mass. There were no significant differences in weight loss across interventions (mean\u2009=\u2009-4.4 kg, SD\u2009=\u20096.5 kg). Telemedicine showed improvements in physical health and cancer-related body image (Ps\u2009=\u20090.04) compared to texting and in sexual functioning compared to EUC (P\u2009=\u20090.03). Total physical activity was increased in EUC compared with telemedicine (P\u2009=\u20090.01), and vigorous physical activity was increased in EUC compared with both interventions (P\u2009=\u20090.01-0.03); walking significantly increased in texting compared with telemedicine (P\u2009=\u20090.02).","Technology-based lifestyle interventions in EC survivors with obesity were accessible and resulted in weight loss and improved quality of life. EUC also produced weight loss, demonstrating a potential for beginning weight management with information on specific diet and exercise goals."

Forty-eight women (body mass index of 30 to 44 kg/m(2)) were enrolled.,"Weight change after 12 months of intervention was as follows (mean +/- SD): 0.85 +/- 6.0 kg in the control group, -2.6 +/- 5.9 kg in the Weight Watchers group, -8.0 +/- 5.5 kg in the individualized group, and -9.4 +/- 8.6 kg in the comprehensive group that used both individualized counseling and Weight Watchers. Weight loss relative to control was statistically significant in the comprehensive group 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization, whereas weight loss in the individualized group was significant only at 12 months. Weight loss of 10% or more of initial body weight was observed in 6 of 10 women in the comprehensive group at 12 months. In the comprehensive and Weight Watchers-only groups, weight loss was significantly related to frequency of attendance at Weight Watchers meetings, and attendance was more frequent in the comprehensive group.",These data indicate that the most weight loss was achieved when the counseling approach combined both Weight Watchers and individualized contacts. This was effective even though most of the individualized contacts were by telephone.
37,28754540,We evaluated the efficacy of the web based P3P (Personal Patient Profile-Prostate) decision aid vs usual care with regard to decisional conflict in men with localized prostate cancer.,"A randomized (1:1), controlled, parallel group, nonblinded trial was performed in 4 regions of the United States. Eligible men had clinically localized prostate cancer and an upcoming consultation, and they spoke and read English or Spanish. Participants answered questionnaires to report decision making stage, personal characteristics, concerns and preferences plus baseline symptoms and decisional conflict. A randomization algorithm allocated participants to receive tailored education and communication coaching, generic teaching sheets and external websites plus a 1-page summary to clinicians (intervention) or the links plus materials provided in clinic (usual care). Conflict outcomes and the number of consultations were measured at 1 month. Univariate and multivariable models were used to analyze outcomes.","A total of 392 men were randomized, including 198 to intervention and 194 to usual care, of whom 152 and 153, respectively, returned 1-month outcomes.

The multivariable model revealed significantly reduced conflict in the intervention group (-5.00, 95% CI -9.40--0.59). Other predictors of conflict included income, marital or partner status, decision status, number of consultations, clinical site and D'Amico risk classification.","In this multicenter trial the decision aid significantly reduced decisional conflict. Other variables impacted conflict and modified the effect of the decision aid, notably risk classification, consultations and resources. P3P is an effective adjunct for shared decision making in men with localized prostate cancer."
38,21667048,"Associations between psychological factors and cancer survival have been under debate. We retrospectively explored the effect of the Cancer Care Intervention (CCI), an individually delivered cognitive behavioral symptom management intervention on survival in individuals with cancer.","Data were obtained from a randomized controlled trial (R01 CA79280; 1997-2003) that were originally designed to evaluate the CCI to reduce symptom severity in 237 individuals with solid tumors during their first course of chemotherapy. Participants were randomized into: (1) ten-contact, 20-week CCI plus usual care (n = 118) and (2) usual care only (n = 119). Survival data as of June 2009 were censored based upon Social Security Death Index.","Participants were mostly female (73.4%), Caucasian (92.8%), and 59.6 \u00b1 10.5 years old. Breast (38.8%) and lung (35%) cancer were the most common cancer types. At enrollment, 66.7% of the participants had cancers at stage III or greater. Overall mortality was 53.2% (126 of 237). The CCI did not significantly affect survival (median survival, CCI = 88 months; usual care = 53.3 months; log rank = 0.30, p = 0.58). Age, stage of cancer, and surgical removal of the tumor were the only factors significantly associated with survival. Post hoc analysis stratified by cancer site and gender (women with breast cancer, women with lung cancer, men with lung cancer, and others) showed no survival effect from the CCI.","In this analysis, the CCI was not associated with better survival. For future research, studies exploring survival outcomes need to consider specific characteristics of each intervention and cancer type."

The fatigue score of all patients decreased from 66 to 43 post-intervention. Sleeping duration increased in both groups and muscular strength increased in the RET group. A higher number of steps in daily living was associated with higher levels of physical and social functioning as well as lower scores for pain and fatigue.",RET and AET are feasible in gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Both training programs seem to improve cancer-related symptoms as well as the patient's physical activities of daily living.
40,30712739,Interactive guided imagery (IGI) and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) are complementary therapies with a recognised positive effect on cancer pain relief. This multicentre randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the adjuvant effect of PMR-IGI in alleviating pain in a sample of hospice patients with terminal cancer.,A total of 104 patients were randomised to two groups.

Couples completed surveys at 4 time points: preintervention, 1 week postgroup, 6 months, and 1 year.","Analyses indicated that anxiety, depressive symptoms, and cancer-specific distress declined and positive well-being improved for couples enrolled in both ECG and SG. Thus, neither treatment was superior in terms of reduction of distress or improvements in positive well-being. Moderator effects indicated that, among patients reporting higher levels of cancer-specific preintervention distress, anxiety, depression, and well-being over the 1-year postintervention time period were significantly lower among SG couples than ECG couples. When patient cancer-specific preintervention distress was low, these 3 outcomes were more positive in ECG relative to SG.

43,14981223,To compare the efficacy of different weight loss regimens on body weight loss and metabolic improvement in breast cancer survivors.,"Forty-eight obese breast cancer survivors were randomly divided into four groups and were followed for 1 year: 1) the Control group (subjects did not receive specific nutrition counseling); 2) the Weight Watchers group (subjects were given free coupons to attend weekly Weight Watchers meetings); 3) the Individualized group (a registered dietitian provided one-on-one nutritional counseling); and 4) the Comprehensive group (subjects received individualized dietary counseling and free coupons for the weekly Weight Watchers meetings). At baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-month data collection visits, a fasting blood sample was obtained for assays. A three-day dietary record was kept during the week before these visits and dietary intake was analyzed.","Subjects in the three intervention groups lost weight (Control: 1.1 +/- 1.7 kg; Weight Watchers: -2.7 +/- 2.1 kg; Individualized: -8.0 +/- 1.9 kg; Comprehensive: -9.5 +/- 2.7 kg) and percentage body fat, but only the Individualized and Comprehensive groups had significant losses. Subjects in the Comprehensive group showed the most improvement in cholesterol levels and had reductions in blood leptin levels.","Because insulin resistance and high blood leptin levels are associated with breast cancer, losing weight to improve these parameters may reduce the risk of recurrence. Only subjects in the Comprehensive group showed significant reductions in body weight and fat, energy intake, and leptin levels. For breast cancer survivors, different weight loss strategies should be considered to assist them in losing weight."

45,17213498,"Telemedicine applications carry the potential to enhance the quality of life of patients, but studies evaluating telemedicine applications are still scarce. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of telemedicine is limited and not yet conclusive. This study investigated whether telemedicine could be beneficial to the quality of life of cancer patients.","Between 1999 and 2002, we conducted a prospective controlled trial evaluating the effects of a telemedicine application on the quality of life of patients with cancer involving the head and neck, using quality of life questionnaires that covered 22 quality of life parameters. All patients had undergone surgery for head and neck cancer at the Erasmus MC, a tertiary university hospital in The Netherlands. Patients in the intervention group were given access to an electronic health information support system for a period of six weeks, starting at discharge from the hospital.","In total, we included 145 patients in the control group and 39 in the intervention group. At 6 weeks, the end of the intervention, the intervention group had significantly improved QoL in 5 of the 22 studied parameters. Only one of these five quality of life parameters remained significantly different at 12 weeks.",This study adds to the sparse evidence that telemedicine may be beneficial for the quality of life of cancer patients.
46,16398423,To observe the clinical efficacy of Xiaoshui Decoction (XSD) in treating ascites in patients suffered from primary liver cancer of Pi-deficiency with damp harassment syndrome (PDDHS) as well as to study the effect through the experiment in mice.,"Sixty-one patients confirmed to be primary liver cancer of PDDHS and accompanied with ascites were randomly divided into the treated group (n=33) and the control group (n=28). The treated group was treated by XSD combined with chemotherapy by locally applying of DDP via abdominal infusion, while the control group treated by DDP infusion alone. The treatment lasted for two months. The conditions of ascites, quality of life (QOL), survival period, and TCM syndrome after treatment were observed. In the experimental study, the mice models of ascites were grouped and treated to observe the conditions of ascites and their survival period.","The short-term total effective rate of the treated group and the control group was 42.4% and 21.4%, the interval of aspirating ascites after treatment was 17.95 +/- 9.63 days and 10.87 +/- 7.76 days, and the 1-year survival rate 33.3% and 14.3%, respectively, significant difference was shown between the two groups in the three parameters (all P &lt; 0.05 ). QOL was improved in both groups with insignificant difference (P &gt; 0.05). Besides, the main symptoms were improved in patients of both groups, especially in the ameliorating of fatigue, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting. Evaluation on safety of treatment showed that XSD had no obvious toxic and adverse reaction, and so it was safe in use. Experimental study showed that on the two mice models of ascites induced by inoculating two kinds of tumor cell, the effect of XSD was superior to that of the control group in aspects of reducing ascites and prolonging survival period, showing significant difference (P &lt; 0.05).","Satisfactory short-term efficacy in treating primary liver cancer with ascites of the Pi-deficiency with damp harassment syndrome could be obtained by XSD. Its effect in prolonging survival period was confirmed by experimental study. XSD can also improve the symptoms and QOL of patients, therefore, it is an effective and reliable remedy for treatment of primary liver cancer with ascites."
47,30145738,"Physical activity has been known to improve survival and quality of life of patients with breast cancer. To find factors associated with physical activity, we analyzed the dataset of the multicenter controlled trial of exercise intervention.",Three hundred fifty-six participants were assigned to two groups: &quot;Smart After-Care&quot; (smartphone application and pedometer were provided) or exercise education only. Physical activity was measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) at baseline and after 12\u00a0weeks. The association between physical activity and other clinical characteristics was analyzed.,"At baseline, physical activity amount was 2315.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093513.2 MET\u00a0min/week: 33.0% inactive, 49.6% minimally active, and 17.4% health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) active. Factors associated with HEPA include cancer stage and grip strength. A significantly lower proportion was HEPA active among those with advanced stage than among those with stage 0. After intervention, physical activity was increased to 3466.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094712.5 MET\u00a0min/week: 15.3% inactive, 50.4% minimally active, and 34.2% HEPA active. Physical activity was increased in 63.4% of the participants. Factors associated with physical activity increase include cancer stage, diarrhea, and type of exercise intervention. Participants with advanced stage have a 3.3 times higher chance of increasing physical activity. Participants who received &quot;Smart After-Care&quot; have a 64% higher chance of increasing physical activity.","Before the intervention, participants with advanced stage are less likely to be HEPA active. Exercise intervention was more beneficial for those with advanced stage or physical symptoms. &quot;Smart After-Care&quot; was more effective than education only in increasing physical activity."
48,22321518,"As patients with pancreas and periampullary cancer (PPC) experience improved survival rates and longevity, the focus shifts toward living life while surviving cancer. Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in all cancer patients. Exercise has been found to effectively decrease fatigue levels and improve physical functioning in cancer patients.","One hundred two patients with resected PPC consented to participate in this study and were randomized to either an intervention group (IG) or a usual care group (UCG). Subjects completed visual analog scales, the FACIT-Fatigue Scale and the Short Form-36v2 after surgery and again 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge.","Patients in the IG and UCG were comparable with regard to demographics, comorbidities, cancer type and staging, type of resection, preoperative fatigue and pain levels, adjuvant therapy, and baseline walking distance. Patients in the IG had significantly improved scores on the FACIT-Fatigue Scale at study completion, improved fatigue and pain scores, as well as overall physical functioning and mental health composite scores. At study completion, participants in the IG were walking twice as far and were significantly more likely to have continued walking or another form of exercise as compared with the UCG. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, 3 mutually exclusive symptom groupings were identified in the cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did not indicate an overall survival benefit for the IG.","This is the first prospective, randomized controlled trial to report that participation in a home walking program confers a significant benefit in resected PPC patients with regard to fatigue levels, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life."
49,12964130,"The quality of medical care by somatically treating physicians has considerable influence on the coping process in cancer patients. In outpatient psychosocial care, information supply and doctor-patient interaction are often considered difficult by the patients. This study therefore investigates the effects of a teaching and training programme on interactional skills of experienced physicians in dealing with cancer patients.","In a pre-post comparison design, the effects of a 6-hour and a 24-hour interaction and teaching programme were compared. To measure the effects, interviews with standardised patients were carried out and analysed using the Medical Interaction Process System (Ford 1998).","About one third of all physicians practicing in the area of M\u00f6nchengladbach, Germany, could be motivated to participate in the programme. The physicians who received the 24-hour training showed a substantial improvement in interaction skills whereas no marked changes were seen in those physicians who had participated in the 6-hour training.","Interactional skills of experienced physicians can be improved by teaching and training programmes. Therefore, doctor-patient interaction training should be integrated into continuing medical education."
50,14692040,"The current study evaluated the efficacy of a 10-week, group-based, cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention relative to a half-day seminar in improving quality of life (QoL) among men who were treated for localized prostate carcinoma (PC) with either radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy.",Ninety-two men were assigned randomly to either the 10-week CBSM group intervention or a 1-day seminar (control group). The intervention was designed to improve QoL by helping participants to identify and effectively manage stressful experiences and was focused on the treatment-related sequelae of PC.,"A hierarchical regression model was used to predict postintervention QoL. The final model, including all predictors and relevant covariates (i.e., income, baseline QoL, ethnicity, and group condition), explained 62.1% of the variance in QoL scores. Group assignment was a significant predictor (beta = - 0.14; P = 0.03) of QoL after the 10-week intervention period, even after controlling for ethnicity, income, and baseline QoL. Post-hoc analyses revealed that individuals in the CBSM intervention condition showed significant improvements in QoL relative to men in the 1-day control seminar. Improved QoL was mediated by greater perceived stress-management skill.","A 10-week cognitive-behavioral group intervention was effective in improving the QoL in men treated for PC, and these changes were associated significantly with intervention-associated increases in perceived stress-management skills."
51,29174501,The ProtecT trial has provided level 1 evidence supporting active surveillance for prostate cancer patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk disease. The effect of these findings on the opinions of North American genitourinary (GU) experts regarding the role of active surveillance for these patients has not been previously examined.,A survey was distributed to 88 practicing North American GU physicians serving on decision-making committees of cooperative group research organizations. Questions pertained to appropriateness of active surveillance in patients with low-risk and intermediate-risk (Gleason 3+4) disease. Opinions regarding active surveillance were correlated with practice patterns using Fisher exact test.,"Forty-two radiation oncologists completed the survey. Forty percent had been in practice for more than 20 years; 90% practice at an academic center. Forty-five percent see\u00a0\u2265 20 patients per month in consultation. More than 95% (40 of 42) recommended active surveillance for Gleason 6 disease, whereas only 17% recommended active surveillance for Gleason 3+4 disease. There were no demographic differences between supporters or opponents regarding active surveillance with regard to monthly patient volume, practice type, likelihood of self-identifying as an expert brachytherapist, belief in advanced imaging techniques, or preferred default external beam radiation therapy dose/fractionation for either low-risk or intermediate-risk disease. However, there was a trend toward greater support of active surveillance for Gleason 3+4 disease among experts having practiced\u00a0&lt; 10 years versus\u00a0\u2265 10 years (P\u00a0= .085).","Active surveillance is almost universally supported by North American GU expert radiation oncologists for low-risk prostate cancer. However, there is very weak support for this strategy in Gleason 3+4 disease despite the ProtecT trial providing level 1 evidentiary support in both risk groups. There were no significant differences between experts supporting versus opposing active surveillance for either low-risk or intermediate-risk disease. These preferences might affect the design of future clinical studies, influencing the adoption of active surveillance in North American clinical practice."
52,10391568,This study was designed to identify factors that predict adherence by African American men to prostate cancer education and early detection.,"In the spring of 1995, the authors identified 548 African American men who were patients at the University Health Services of the University of Chicago, were ages 40-70 years, and did not have a personal history of prostate cancer. Baseline telephone survey data were collected from 413 men (75%). Participants were randomly assigned to either a minimal or an enhanced intervention group. Men in the former group were mailed a letter and a reminder that invited them to a urology clinic for prostate cancer education and early detection. Men in the enhanced intervention group were sent the same correspondence and were also given print material and telephone contacts, which were tailored to each recipient.","Adherence was significantly higher (OR = 2.6, CI: 1.7-3.9) in the enhanced intervention group than in the minimal intervention group (51% and 29%, respectively). Men who were age 50 years or older (OR = 1.7, CI: 1.1-2.8), were married (OR = 1.8, CI: 1.2-2.9), believed that prostate cancer early detection examination should be performed in the absence of symptoms (OR = 2.3, CI: 1.3-4.0), and self-reported an intention to have an early detection examination (OR = 1.9, CI: 1.2-2.9) were also more likely to adhere.","A tailored behavioral intervention can influence adherence to prostate cancer early detection among African American men. Individual background and cognitive and psychosocial characteristics may also affect behavior. Future studies should assess the impact of this type of intervention on cognitive and psychologic correlates of decision-making and behavior along the continuum of prostate cancer care.

53,10475183,"The use of sunscreens on the skin can prevent sunburn but whether long-term use can prevent skin cancer is not known. Also, there is evidence that oral betacarotene supplementation lowers skin-cancer rates in animals, but there is limited evidence of its effect in human beings.","In a community-based randomised trial with a 2 by 2 factorial design, individuals were assigned to four treatment groups: daily application of a sun protection factor 15-plus sunscreen to the head, neck, arms, and hands, and betacarotene supplementation (30 mg per day); sunscreen plus placebo tablets; betacarotene only; or placebo only. Participants were 1621 residents of Nambour in southeast Queensland, Australia. The endpoints after 4.5 years of follow-up were the incidence of basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas both in terms of people treated for newly diagnosed disease and in terms of the numbers of tumours that occurred. Analysis of the effect of sunscreen was based only on skin cancers that developed on sites of daily application. All analyses were by intention to treat.","1383 participants underwent full skin examination by a dermatologist in the follow-up period. 250 of them developed 758 new skin cancers during the follow-up period. There were no significant differences in the incidence of first new skin cancers between groups randomly assigned daily sunscreen and no daily sunscreen (basal-cell carcinoma 2588 vs 2509 per 100,000; rate ratio 1.03 [95% CI 0.73-1.46]; squamous-cell carcinoma 876 vs 996 per 100,000; rate ratio 0.88 [0.50-1.56]). Similarly, there was no significant difference between the betacarotene and placebo groups in incidence of either cancer (basal-cell carcinoma 3954 vs 3806 per 100,000; 1.04 [0.73-1.27]; squamous-cell carcinoma 1508 vs 1146 per 100,000; 1.35 [0.84-2.19]). In terms of the number of tumours, there was no effect on incidence of basal-cell carcinoma by sunscreen use or by betacarotene but the incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly lower in the sunscreen group than in the no daily sunscreen group (1115 vs 1832 per 100,000; 0.61 [0.46-0.81]).","There was no harmful effect of daily use of sunscreen in this medium-term study. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, but not basal-cell carcinoma seems to be amenable to prevention through the routine use of sunscreen by adults for 4.5 years. There was no beneficial or harmful effect on the rates of either type of skin cancer, as a result of betacarotene supplementation."
54,10407709,"Mammography is an important screening tool for the early detection of breast cancer. However, mammogram screening rates are low, despite interventions to improve them. We investigated two methods to improve mammogram screening and compared mammogram rates among women who received these interventions to mammogram screening rates in a control group.

The second group of women (n = 102) received a reminder letter from the radiology department. The third group (n = 86) received a reminder letter followed by a phone call from the physician's office staff if no mammogram had been obtained within 8 weeks after the due date for the mammogram. All three groups were monitored for 14 weeks after the due date to determine mammogram screening rates in each group.","A mammogram was obtained by 33% of women in group 1, 37% of women in group 2, and 57% of women in group 3. The mammogram screening rate of the third group was significantly greater than in the first two groups. In the third group, the additional cost added by the phone call intervention was $9 per mammogram obtained.",Mammogram screening rates are increased when patients are contacted by both a reminder letter and a phone call.
55,18725822,"Publicly-funded health centers serve disadvantaged populations who underuse colorectal cancer screening (CRC). Because physicians play a key role in patient adherence to screening, provider interventions within health center practices could improve the delivery/utilization of CRC screening.","A 2-group study design was used with 4 pairs of health centers randomized to the intervention or control condition. The provider intervention featured academic detailing of the small practice groups, followed by a strategic planning session with the entire health center staff using SWOT analysis. The outcome measure of provider endoscopy referral/fecal occult blood test dispensing and/or completion of CRC screening was determined by medical record audit (n = 2224). The intervention effect was evaluated using generalized estimating equations. Pre-post intervention patient surveys (n = 281) were conducted.","Chart audits of the 1 year period before and after the intervention revealed a 16% increase from baseline in CRC screening referral/dispensing/completion among intervention centers, compared with a 4% increase among controls, odds ratio (OR) = 2.25 (1.67-3.04) P &lt; 0.001.

59,19622708,"To test experimentally whether a psychological intervention reduces depression-related symptoms and markers of inflammation among cancer patients and to test one mechanism for the intervention effects. Depression and inflammation are common among cancer patients. Data suggest that inflammation can contribute to depressive symptoms, although the converse remains untested.","As part of a randomized clinical trial, newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (n = 45) with clinically significant depressive symptoms were evaluated and randomized to psychological intervention with assessment or assessment only study arms. The intervention spanned 12 months, with assessments at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. Mixed-effects modeling tested the hypothesis that the intervention reduced self-reported depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, Profile of Mood States Depression and Fatigue subscales, and Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36 Bodily Pain subscale) and immune cell numbers that are elevated in the presence of inflammation (white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and helper/suppressor ratio). Mediation analyses tested whether change in depressive symptoms, pain, or fatigue predicted change in white blood cell count, neutrophil count, or the helper/suppressor ratio.","The intervention reduced significantly depressive symptoms, pain, fatigue, and inflammation markers. Moreover, the intervention effect on inflammation was mediated by its effect on depressive symptoms.","This is the first experiment to test whether psychological treatment effective in reducing depressive symptoms would also reduce indicators of inflammation. Data show that the intervention reduced directly depressive symptoms and reduced indirectly inflammation. Psychological treatment may treat effectively depressive symptoms, pain, and fatigue among cancer patients."

Quality of life measured by the Quality-of-Life index (QL-index) increased significantly in both groups, but did not differ between groups.",No clinical benefit could be demonstrated despite long-term and continuous improved food intake in cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing aggressive chemotherapy.
64,11783208,To observe the clinical efficacy of radio- or chemotherapy plus traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by Syndrome Differentiation in treating brain metastatic tumor.,"Forty-one patients were randomized into four groups: Group A treated with chemotherapy plus TCM, Group B with radiotherapy plus TCM, Group C with chemotherapy alone and Group D with radiotherapy alone. The efficacies of the four groups were compared.","The short-term response rate, living quality, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year survival rate, median survival period and immunity of the Group A and B were significantly higher than those of the Group C and D (P &lt; 0.05).","Radio- or chemotherapy plus TCM by Syndrome Differentiation has the effect of tumor growth inhibition, survival period extension and living quality enhancement in treating brain metastases."
65,15908668,The efficacy of a home-based physical activity (PA) intervention for early-stage breast cancer patients was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.,"Eighty-six sedentary women (mean age, 53.14 years; standard deviation, 9.70 years) who had completed treatment for stage 0 to II breast cancer were randomly assigned to a PA or contact control group. Participants in the PA group received 12 weeks of PA counseling (based on the Transtheoretical Model) delivered via telephone, as well as weekly exercise tip sheets. Assessments were conducted at baseline, after treatment (12 weeks), and 6 and 9 month after baseline follow-ups. The post-treatment outcomes are reported here.","Analyses showed that, after treatment, the PA group reported significantly more total minutes of PA, more minutes of moderate-intensity PA, and higher energy expenditure per week than controls. The PA group also out-performed controls on a field test of fitness. Changes in PA were not reflected in objective activity monitoring. The PA group was more likely than controls to progress in motivational readiness for PA and to meet PA guidelines. No significant group differences were found in body mass index and percent body fat. Post-treatment group comparisons revealed significant improvements in vigor and a reduction in fatigue in the PA group. There was a positive trend in intervention effects on overall mood and body esteem.",The intervention successfully increased PA and improved fitness and specific aspects of psychological well-being among early-stage breast cancer patients. The success of a home-based PA intervention has important implications for promoting recovery in this population.
66,25467005,"To evaluate the long-term effects of dietary intervention on gastrointestinal symptoms after highly dose-escalated radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, using boost with protons or high-dose-rate brachytherapy.","Patients were randomized to an intervention group (n=64) advised to reduce insoluble dietary fiber and lactose intake, or to a standard care group (n=66) advised to continue their usual diet. Gastrointestinal symptoms, other domains of health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and dietary intake were evaluated for \u2a7d24months post-radiotherapy with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PR25, Gastrointestinal Side Effects Questionnaire, and Food Frequency Questionnaire. The effect of the intervention on gastrointestinal symptoms was evaluated using generalized estimating equations.","Dietary intervention had no obvious effect on long-term gastrointestinal symptoms or HRQOL. The intervention group markedly reduced their dietary fiber and lactose intake during radiotherapy, but adherence tended to decline over time. The vast majority of long-term gastrointestinal symptoms were reported as 'a little', with a noticeable difference from pre-treatment only for unintentional stool leakage, limitations on daily activities, and mucus discharge.","Long-term gastrointestinal symptoms were predominantly mild, and dietary intervention was not superior to a usual diet in preventing these symptoms."
67,8186168,Active participation and asking questions are important ways in which patients can ensure they understand what the doctor has said. This study evaluated a question prompt sheet designed to encourage patients to ask questions in the cancer consultation.,Patients (n = 142) were randomised to receive (i) a question prompt sheet or (ii) a general sheet informing patients of services available through the regional Cancer Council. Recall of information was assessed in a structured interview 4-20 days after the consultation. Questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction and adjustment to cancer were sent by mail.,"The question prompt sheet had a significant effect in one content area: prognosis. Thirty-five percent of patients who received the question handout asked questions about prognosis compared to 16% of those receiving the information handout. The prompt sheet did not increase the mean number of questions asked overall. Age, in/out-patient status, gender and involvement preference were predictive of both number and duration of patient questions.",A question prompt sheet has a limited but important effect on patient question asking behaviour in the cancer consultation.
68,29239243,This study aimed to explore the feasibility of an individualized comprehensive lifestyle intervention in cancer patients undergoing curative or palliative chemotherapy.,"At one cancer center, serving a population of 180,000, 100 consecutive of 161 eligible newly diagnosed cancer patients starting curative or palliative chemotherapy entered a 12-month comprehensive, individualized lifestyle intervention. Participants received a grouped startup course and monthly counseling, based on self-reported and electronically evaluated lifestyle behaviors. Patients with completed baseline and end of study measurements are included in the final analyses. Patients who did not complete end of study measurements are defined as dropouts.","More completers (n\u2009=\u200961) vs. dropouts (n\u2009=\u200939) were married or living together (87 vs. 69%, p\u2009=\u2009.031), and significantly higher baseline physical activity levels (960 vs. 489\u2009minwk, p\u2009=\u2009.010), more healthy dietary choices (14 vs 11 points, p\u2009=\u2009.038) and fewer smokers (8 vs. 23%, p\u2009=\u2009.036) were observed among completers vs. dropouts. Logistic regression revealed younger (odds ratios (OR): 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 0.99) and more patients diagnosed with breast cancer vs. more severe cancer types (OR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.56) among completers vs. dropouts.

No significant reductions were observed in physical activity levels. Patients treated with palliative intent did not reduce their physical activity levels while healthy dietary habits (38%, p\u2009=\u20090.021) and distress (104%, p\u2009=\u20090.012) was improved.",Favorable and possibly clinical relevant lifestyle changes were observed in cancer patients undergoing curative or palliative chemotherapy after a 12-month comprehensive and individualized lifestyle intervention. Palliative patients were able to participate and to improve their lifestyle behaviors.
69,22472463,"To investigate the effects of a pelvic floor rehabilitation program (PFRP) on pelvic floor function and quality of life (QoL) in gynecological cancer survivors in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.","Thirty-four patients with gynecological cancers recruited between July 2009 and December 2009 were randomly allocated into two groups: a PFRP group (n=17), who participated in a 4-week PFRP exercise program, and a non-PFRP group (n=17), who received the usual health care. The pelvic floor strength, the motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by sacral and transcranial magnetic stimulation, the pelvic floor questionnaire, and the scores on two QoL questionnaires, (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-CX 24, from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) were evaluated to assess changes in pelvic floor function and QoL before and after the exercise program.","Twenty four patients (12 from each group) completed the exercise program. The PFRP group improved in pelvic floor strength (mean difference (MD)=14.22, t(9)=2.389, P=0.036) and sexual functioning. The PFRP group also improved in physical and sexual function compared with the non-PFRP group.",The results suggest that the PFRP improved pelvic floor dysfunction and QoL of gynecological cancer patients. A larger randomized controlled trial is planned.
70,9527321,To study if long-term supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene is associated with cataract prevalence and severity.,"An end-of-trial random sample of 1828 participants from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene cancer prevention study. The alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene cancer prevention study was originally designed to examine whether supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene would reduce the incidence of lung cancer in male smokers. The participants for this study lived in Helsinki City or Uusimaa province and were at entry to the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene cancer prevention study 50 to 69 years old and smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day. They received alpha-tocopherol 50 mg/day, beta-carotene 20 mg/day, a combination of the two, or placebo supplements for 5 to 8 years (median 6.6 years). Outcome measures were: cortical, nuclear, and posterior subcapsular cataract, differentiated and quantified with lens opacity classification system (LOCS II). Lens opacity meter provided a continuous measure of cataract density.","Supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene was not associated with the end-of-trial prevalence of nuclear (odds ratio 1.1 and 1.2, respectively), cortical (odds ratio 1.0 and 1.3, respectively), or posterior subcapsular cataract (odds ratio 1.1 and 1.0, respectively) when adjusted for possible confounders in logistic model. Neither did the median lens opacity meter values differ between the supplementation groups, indicating no effect of alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene on cataract severity.","Supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene for 5 to 8 years does not influence the cataract prevalence among middle-aged, smoking men."
71,8214179,The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether group psychotherapy during radiotherapy for cancer significantly decreases patients' emotional and physical distress.,"Twenty-four patients receiving radiotherapy were randomly selected for group psychotherapy (six patients per group, 90-minute weekly sessions for 10 weeks). Another 24 patients served as control subjects. Each patient was given the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS) at the onset of radiotherapy, midway through radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, and 4 and 8 weeks after radiotherapy ended.","The combined SADS items for depression, pessimism and hopelessness, somatic preoccupation and worry, social isolation and withdrawal, insomnia, and anxiety and agitation were used as a measure of emotional distress. The combined SADS items for anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and fatigue were used as a measure of physical distress. By 4 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, the patients who received group psychotherapy showed significant decreases in both emotional and physical symptoms, and the decreases were greater than those for the control patients. The subjects who initially seemed unaware of their cancer diagnoses had the lowest baseline levels of emotional and physical distress, but 4 weeks after the end of radiotherapy they had high distress levels.",Group therapy may enhance quality of life for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy by reducing their emotional and physical distress. The degree to which patients acknowledge the diagnosis of malignancy may be a factor in their initial distress level and their response to radiotherapy and group therapy.
72,27869293,Korean American women have among the lowest rates of cervical cancer screening in the United States. The authors evaluated a multicomponent intervention combining community education with navigation services to reduce access barriers and increase screening rates in this underserved population. It was hypothesized that cervical cancer screening rates would be higher among women who received the intervention program compared with those in the control program.,"Korean American women (N\u2009=\u2009705) were recruited from 22 churches. In this matched-pair, group-randomized design, 347 women received the intervention, which consisted of a culturally relevant cancer education program combined with provision of navigation services. The control group (N\u2009=\u2009358) received general health education, including information about cervical cancer risk and screening and where to obtain low-cost or no-cost screening. Screening behavior was assessed 12 months after the program.","Screening behavior data were obtained from 588 women 12 months after the program. In both site-level and participant-level analyses, the intervention program contributed to significantly higher screening rates compared with the control program (odds ratio [OR], 25.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1-66.1; P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). In sensitivity analysis, the treatment effect remained highly significant (OR, 16.7; 95% CI, 8.1-34.4; P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001).",A multicomponent intervention combining community cancer education with navigation services yielded significant increases in cervical cancer screening rates among underscreened Korean American women. Community-accessible programs that incorporate cancer education with the delivery of key navigation services can be highly effective in increasing cervical cancer screening rates in this underserved population.

73,28075038,"Change in cognitive ability is a commonly reported adverse effect by breast cancer survivors. The underlying etiology of cognitive complaints is unclear and to date, there is limited evidence for effective intervention strategies. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function in older adults and animal models treated with chemotherapy. This proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial tested the effect of aerobic exercise versus usual lifestyle on cognitive function in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.","Women, aged 40 to 65\u00a0years, postmenopausal, stages I to IIIA breast cancer, and who self-reported cognitive dysfunction following chemotherapy treatment, were recruited and randomized to a 24-week aerobic exercise intervention (EX; n\u00a0=\u00a010) or usual lifestyle control (CON; n\u00a0=\u00a09). Participants completed self-report measures of the impact of cognitive issues on quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive version 3), objective neuropsychological testing, and functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 24\u00a0weeks.","Compared to CON, EX had a reduced time to complete a processing speed test (trail making test-A) (-14.2\u00a0seconds, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.01; effect size 0.35). Compared to CON, there was no improvement in self-reported cognitive function and effect sizes were small. Interestingly, lack of between-group differences in Stroop behavioral performance was accompanied by functional changes in several brain regions of interest in EX compared to CON at 24\u00a0weeks.",These findings provide preliminary proof-of-concept results for the potential of aerobic exercise to improve cancer-related cognitive impairment and will serve to inform the development of future trials.
74,18949672,We investigated whether acupuncture as a supportive antiemetic approach reduces the need for antiemetic rescue medication during highly emetogenic chemotherapy in pediatric oncology. We report on a multicenter crossover study at 5 tertiary hospitals in Germany.,"Twenty-three children (13.6 y,+/- 2.9) receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy for treatment of solid malignant tumors were included. Patients were randomly allocated to receive acupuncture treatment during either the second or third identical chemotherapy course together with standard antiemetic medication. The main outcome measure was the amount of additional antiemetic medication during chemotherapy. Secondary outcome measure was the number of episodes of vomiting per course.",Fourty-six chemotherapy courses with or without acupuncture were compared. The need for rescue antiemetic medication was significantly lower in acupuncture courses compared to control courses (p=0.001) Episodes of vomiting per course were also significantly lower in courses with acupuncture (p=0.01). Except for pain from needling (4/23) no side effects occurred. Patients acceptance of acupuncture was high.,Acupuncture as applied here seems to be effective in preventing nausea and vomiting in pediatric cancer patients.
75,22038523,Conflicting data regarding cardiovascular effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and extra-skeletal effects of vitamin D supported the need for a definitive trial. The Thiazolidinedione Intervention with vitamin D Evaluation (TIDE) trial aimed to assess the effects of TZDs (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) on cardiovascular outcomes and the effects of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) on cancers and mortality.,"A large multicentre 3 \u00d7 2 factorial double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial recruited from outpatient primary care and specialty clinics in 33 countries. From June 2009 to July 2010, 1,332 people with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors aged \u2265 50 years whose HbA(1c) was 6.5-9.5% (48-80 mmol/mol) when using two or fewer glucose-lowering drugs were randomised by a central computer system to placebo (n =\u2009541), rosiglitazone 4-8 mg/day (n\u2009=\u2009399) or pioglitazone 30-45 mg/day (n\u2009=\u2009392); 1,221 participants were randomised to placebo (n\u2009=\u2009614) or vitamin D 1,000 IU/day (n\u2009=\u2009607). Participants and all study personnel were blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome for the TZD arm was the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death, and for the vitamin D arm it was cancer or all-cause death. All randomised participants were included in the primary analysis.","From the study design, 16,000 people were to be followed for approximately 5.5 years. However, the trial was stopped prematurely because of regulatory concerns after a mean of 162 days without consideration of the accrued data. In the TZD arm, the cardiovascular outcome occurred in five participants (0.9%) in the placebo groups and three participants (0.4%) in the TZD groups (two allocated to pioglitazone, one to rosiglitazone). In the vitamin D arm, the primary outcome occurred in three participants (0.5%) in the placebo group and in two participants (0.3%) receiving vitamin D. Adverse events were comparable in all groups.",Uncertainty persists regarding the clinically relevant risks and benefits of TZDs and vitamin D because of the early cancellation of this comprehensive trial.
76,9808821,Results are reported from a large randomized trial designed to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among callers to the Cancer Information Service (CIS).,"CIS callers assigned to the intervention group received a brief proactive educational intervention over the telephone at the end of usual service, with two follow-up mailouts. Key educational messages and print material derived from the NCI 5 A Day for Better Health program were provided to intervention subjects. Subjects were interviewed by telephone at both 4-week (n = 1,672) and 4-month (n = 1,286) follow-up.","A single-item measure of fruit and vegetable consumption revealed a significant intervention effect of approximately 0.65 servings per day at 4-week follow-up (P &lt; 0.001) and 0.41 servings per day at 4-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001). Using a seven-item food frequency measure that was also included in the 4-month interviews, a similar intervention effect of 0.34 servings per day was obtained (P = 0.006). The vast majority of CIS callers (88%) endorsed the strategy of providing 5 A Day information proactively.",A brief educational intervention delivered to CIS callers at the end of usual service was associated with an increase in self-reported fruit and vegetable intake.
77,8018682,"Toward developing attractive and effective means to reduce cancer risks faced by Native American people, this study developed and tested interactive computer software to improve dietary choices and prevent tobacco use among Native American adolescents.","Based on a legend of the Seneca Nation, a cancer prevention lesson was developed and programmed for software. A sample of 368 Native American adolescents were divided randomly into intervention and control arms. Youths in both arms were pre-tested, youths in the intervention arm interacted with the software, and all youths were post-tested. Pre-test and post-test measures covered information and attitudes about cancer risks from dietary practices and tobacco use.","Pre-test scores differed between the two arms on youths' age and on one outcome variable. Relative to their counterparts in the control arm, youths in the intervention arm increased their post-test scores on 8 of 12 outcome measurement variables. Process data gathered during intervention delivery indicated that nearly all youths were involved with the interactive software and lesson.",Interactive computer software holds promise for delivering cancer risk reduction intervention aimed at modifying dietary habits and preventing tobacco use among Native American youth.
78,26228466,The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effects of yoga on health-related quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer.,Patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer were randomly assigned to a 10-week yoga intervention (90 min once weekly) or a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measure was disease-specific quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Colorectal [FACT-C]) at week 10. Secondary outcome measures included FACT-C subscales: spiritual well-being (FACT - Spirituality); fatigue (FACT - Fatigue); sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory); depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); body awareness (Scale of Body Connection); and body-efficacy expectations (Body-Efficacy Expectations Scale). Outcomes were assessed at week 10 and week 22 after randomization.,"Fifty-four patients (mean age 68.3 \u00b1 9.7 years) were randomized to yoga (n = 27; attrition rate 22.2%) and control group (n = 27; attrition rate 18.5%). Patients in the yoga group attended a mean of 5.3 \u00b1 4.0 yoga classes. No significant group differences for the FACT-C total score were found. Group differences were found for emotional well-being at week 22 (\u2206 = 1.59; 95% CI = 0.27,2.90; p = 0.019), sleep disturbances at week 22 (\u2206 = -1.08; 95% CI = -2.13, -0.03; p = 0.043), anxiety at week 10 (\u2206 = -1.14; 95% CI = -2.20, -0.09; p = 0.043), and depression at week 10 (\u2206 = -1.34; 95% CI = -2.61, -0.8; p = 0.038). No serious adverse events occurred in the yoga group, while liver metastases were diagnosed in one patient in the control group.","This randomized trial found no effects of yoga on health-related quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer. Given the high attrition rate and low intervention adherence, no definite conclusions can be drawn from this trial."
79,16157935,"The Big Lung Trial (BLT) was a large, pragmatic trial to evaluate the addition of chemotherapy to primary treatment (ie, surgery, radical radiotherapy, or supportive care) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the supportive care group, there was a small but significant survival benefit in patients treated with chemotherapy compared with supportive care alone (no chemotherapy). A substudy was undertaken to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) implications of the treatment options. QoL was assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaires C30 (QLQ-C30) and LC17, and daily diary cards.","EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC17 were collected at 0, 6 to 8, 12, 18, and 24 weeks. Diary cards were completed during the first 12 weeks of the study. The primary end point was global QoL at 12 weeks.","A total of 273 patients were randomly assigned: 138 to no chemotherapy and 135 to chemotherapy. There was no evidence of a large detrimental effect on QoL of chemotherapy. No statistically significant differences in global QoL or physical/emotional functioning, fatigue and dyspnea, and pain were detected at 12 weeks. Higher rates of palliative radiotherapy in the no chemotherapy arm may have lessened differences in QoL. Global QoL, role functioning, fatigue, appetite loss, and constipation were prognostic indicators of survival at 12 weeks.",There were no important adverse effects of chemotherapy on QoL.
80,23775525,Obese men have an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa)-specific mortality. Potential mechanisms include insulin and related proteins. We investigate whether a short-term caloric restriction diet in overweight/obese men with newly diagnosed PCa can lead to measurable changes in patient anthropometrics and insulin-related proteins.,"Overweight and obese PCa patients choosing active surveillance or radical prostatectomy were randomized to a 6-week, caloric-restricted diet or to continue their current diet. Changes from baseline to end of study in anthropometrics, dietary constituents and serum proteins (insulin, c-peptide, IGF-1, adiponectin, IGF-BP3) were compared between the intervention and control groups using a Generalized Estimating Equation model.","Nineteen patients were randomized to the intervention (N\u2009=\u200910) or control (N\u2009=\u20099) group. Men in the intervention group had a 1.7% (3.7\u2009lbs) mean decline in weight versus 1.0% (2.0\u2009lbs) in controls (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05), and a reduced intake of calories, total and saturated fat, protein and starch (all P\u2009&lt;\u20090.1 compared to controls). There was a significant difference (P\u2009=\u20090.002) in mean serum IGFBP-3 between the intervention (+2.8%) and control group (-6.9%). Other biomarkers changed with the diet intervention to a degree similar to previous weight loss studies but were not statistically significant compared with controls.","In this small pilot study, a 6-week caloric restricted diet in men with newly diagnosed PCa produced changes in weight, diet and serum proteins possibly related to prognosis. These results support larger-scale trials testing longer-term weight loss effects on potential PCa progression biomarkers."
81,22614993,"The negative attitudes of patients with cancer regarding clinical trials are an important contributor to low participation rates. This study evaluated whether a brief psychoeducational intervention was effective in improving patients' attitudes as well as their knowledge, self-efficacy for decision making, receptivity to receiving more information, and general willingness to participate in clinical trials.","A total of 472 adults with cancer who had not been asked previously to participate in a clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive printed educational information about clinical trials or a psychoeducational intervention that provided similar information and also addressed misperceptions and concerns about clinical trials. The primary (attitudes) and secondary outcomes (knowledge, self-efficacy, receptivity, and willingness) were assessed via patient self-report before random assignment and 7 to 28 days later.","Patients who received the psychoeducational intervention showed more positive attitudes toward clinical trials (P = .016) and greater willingness to participate (P = .011) at follow-up than patients who received printed educational information. Evidence of an indirect effect of intervention assignment on willingness to participate (estimated at 0.168; 95% CI, 0.088 to 0.248) suggested that the benefits of psychoeducation on willingness to participate were explained by the positive impact of psychoeducation on attitudes toward clinical trials.",A brief psychoeducational intervention can improve the attitudes of patients with cancer toward clinical trials and thereby increase their willingness to participate in clinical trials. Findings support conducting additional research to evaluate effects of this intervention on quality of decision making and rates of participation among patients asked to enroll onto therapeutic clinical trials.
82,10090869,Previous research has shown that breast and cervical cancer screening rates are low among Vietnamese women.,"Over a 24-month period, we implemented a media-led community education campaign to promote recognition, intention, receipt, and currency of routine checkups, clinical breast examinations, mammograms, and Pap tests among Vietnamese-American women in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties in northern California. Women in Los Angeles and Orange Counties in southern California served as controls. To evaluate its impact, pretest telephone interviews were conducted of 451 randomly selected women in the intervention area and 482 women in the control area and posttest interviews with 454 and 422 women, respectively.","At posttest, after controlling for demographic differences in the surveyed populations, the odds ratios for the intervention effect were statistically significant for having heard of a general checkup, Paptest, and clinical breast examination (CBE); planning to have a checkup, Pap test, CBE, and mammogram; and having had a checkup and Pap test. The intervention had no effect on being up to date for any of the tests.",A media-led education intervention succeeded in increasing recognition of and intention to undertake screening tests more than receipt of or currency with the tests.
83,28060675,To examine the effectiveness of a health promotion flyer to increase awareness of breast cancer risk and physical activity as a risk reduction strategy in young adult women.,Young adult women (N = 123) viewed one of five health promotion flyers online and then completed measures of perceived breast cancer risk (PR) and perceived informativeness (PI) and a qualitative thought-listing activity.,"Differences were observed in PI such that the control and low risk/low information messages were significantly less informative than the others. Qualitative analyses revealed two general themes: message content and flyer design. Additional analyses of the flyer design comments revealed four sub-themes: negative thoughts about the image, positive thoughts about the image, misunderstanding breast cancer risk information, and social comparison. Exploratory analyses controlling for message type indicated that image appraisal predicted PI such that those who commented on the image found the flyer to be less informative.","Results suggest that the flyer was informative but did not impact young women's breast cancer risk perceptions. Additionally, the image may have distracted young women from the intended message. Evaluating the acceptability of images used in health promotion materials is recommended before testing the effectiveness of the intervention."
84,20159820,"We examined how an aerobic exercise intervention influenced circulating estradiol, estrone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), androstenedione, and testosterone levels, which may be involved in the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk.","A two-center, two-arm randomized controlled trial of exercise was conducted in 320 postmenopausal, sedentary women age 50 to 74 years. Participants were randomly assigned to a 1-year aerobic exercise intervention of 225 min/wk (n = 160) or to a control group who maintained their usual level of activity (n = 160). Baseline, 6-month, and 12-month assessments of estrone, estradiol, androstenedione, and testosterone were quantified by radioimmunoassay after extraction, and SHBG was quantified by an immunometric assay. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed models.","Blood data were available on 309 women (96.6%) at 12 months. Women in the intervention group exercised an average of 3.6 d/wk for 178 min/wk. At 12 months, statistically significant reductions in estradiol (treatment effect ratio [TER] = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.98) and free estradiol (TER = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.96) and increases in SHBG (TER = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.07) were observed in the exercise group compared with the control group. No significant differences in estrone, androstenedione, and testosterone levels were observed between exercisers and controls at 12 months.",This trial found that previously sedentary postmenopausal women can adhere to a moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise program that results in changes in estradiol and SHBG concentrations that are consistent with a lower risk for postmenopausal breast cancer.
85,10964333,"To the authors' knowledge, there had been no evidence for the efficacy of psychosocial intervention among Japanese cancer patients. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a psychosocial group intervention in reducing psychologic distress and enhancing coping in this population in a randomized controlled trial.","The patient selection criteria were age younger than 65 years, lymph node metastasis positive and/or histologic or nuclear Grade 2-3, and surgery undergone within the previous 4-18 months as of the start of the study. We conducted a 6-week, structured, psychosocial group intervention. The intervention consisted of health education, coping skills training, stress management, and psychologic support. Subjects were assessed for psychologic distress and coping by administering the Profile of Mood States (POMS), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) scale at the baseline, at 6 weeks, and at 6 months.","Fifty (33%) of the 151 patients participated and were randomized, and 46 (30%) completed the study. The experimental group had significantly lower scores than the controls for total mood disturbance and significantly higher scores for vigor on the POMS, and significantly higher scores for fighting spirit on the MAC at the end of the 6-week intervention. These improvements were sustained over 6 months of follow-up.",The results of this study suggest that a short term psychosocial group intervention produces significant long term improvement in the quality of life of Japanese patients with primary breast carcinoma.
86,12764907,"To compare the clinical curative effects between 89Sr and its combination with the Guliu recipe (GLR, a Chinese herbal medicine) in treating multiple bone metastatic tumor of mammary cancer (MBM-MC).","By adopting the random sampling and grouping method, 89Sr alone (Sr) and 89Sr combined with CHM (Sr-GLR) were used in treating 86 and 40 patients with MBM-MC respectively. The efficacy of therapy were appraised according to the degree of ostalgia relieving and quality of life (QOF) in patients, and the effect of treatment on focal bone metabolism and bone marrow hematopoietic function were compared.","The effective rate of Sr and Sr-GLR in relieving ostalgia was 83.72% and 95.00%, respectively (P &gt; 0.05), the QOF improving and stabilizing rate of them 80.23% and 95.00% (P &lt; 0.05), the effective rate on focal bone metabolism 59.30% and 52.50% (P &gt; 0.05) and their hemo-toxicity 28.00% and 30.00% (P &gt; 0.05).","Sr-GLR is a combination therapy in treating MBM-MC with good effect, it could raise the patient's QOF, enhance the ostalgia relieving effect without increasing the hemo-toxicity of treatment."
87,22018935,"Nearly 35% of men treated for prostate cancer (PrCA) will experience biochemically defined recurrence, noted by a rise in PSA, within 10 years of definitive therapy. Diet, physical activity, and stress reduction may affect tumor promotion and disease progression.","A randomized trial of an intensive diet, physical activity, and meditation intervention was conducted in men with rising post-treatment PSA after definitive treatment for PrCA. Intention-to-treat methods were used to compare usual care to the intervention in 47 men with complete data. Signal detection methods were used to identify dietary factors associated with PSA change.","The intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on any demographic or disease-related factor. Although the intervention group experienced decreases of 39% in intakes of saturated fatty acid (SFA as percent of total calories) (p&lt;0.0001) and 12% in total energy intake (218 kcal/day, p&lt;0.05)], no difference in PSA change was observed by intervention status. Signal detection methods indicated that in men increasing their consumption of fruit, 56% experienced no rise in PSA (vs. 29% in men who did not increase their fruit intake). Among men who increased fruit and fiber intakes, PSA increased in 83% of participants who also increased saturated fatty acid intake (vs. 44% in participants who decreased or maintained saturated fatty acid intake).","Results are discussed in the context of conventional treatment strategies that were more aggressive when this study was being conducted in the mid-2000s. Positive health changes in a number of lifestyle parameters were observed with the intervention, and both increased fruit and reduced saturated fat intakes were associated with maintaining PSA levels in men with biochemically recurrent disease."
88,16418556,"This study was to determine the effects of abdominal breathing training using biofeedback on stress, immune response, and quality of life.","The study design was a nonequivalent control group pretest- posttest, quasi-experimental design. Twenty-five breast cancer patients who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled. The experimental group (n=12) was provided with abdominal breathing training using biofeedback once a week for 4 weeks. State anxiety, cancer physical symptoms, serum cortisol, T cell subsets (T3, T4, T8), NK cell and quality of life were measured both before and after the intervention.","Though state anxiety, cancer physical symptoms, and serum cortisol were reduced after 4 weeks of abdominal breathing training using biofeedback, there was no statistical significance. It showed, however, improvement in quality of life (p=.02), and T3 (p=.04).","Abdominal breathing training using biofeedback improves quality of life in breast cancer patients after a mastectomy. However, the mechanism of this beneficial effect and stress response requires further investigation with special consideration in subject selection and frequency of measurement. Nurses should consider this strategy as a standard nursing intervention for people living with cancer."
89,17898956,To observe the clinical effect of the combined therapy using argon-helium cryosurgery (Ar-He knife) and Chinese herbal medicine in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).,Fifty-seven patients of NSCLC were treated with the combined therapy and observed.,"The treatment was successfully completed in all patients with mild adverse reactions. The effective rate was 83.8% 3 months after the operation, 79.6% 6 months after the operation, and 77.3% 12 months after the operation, with median survival of 9 months. The survival rate after 12 months was 46.67% (21/45), 34.62% (9/26) after 18 months, and 36.36% (4/11) after 24 months.","Argon-helium cryosurgery therapy is superior in its assured orientation, quick tumor load deprivation and less postoperational reaction. Combined with Chinese herbal medication, Argon-helium cryosurgery therapy can prolong survival time, relieve clinical symptoms, and elevate the quality of life in NSCLC patients, and is thus worthy of promotion."
90,25355261,To evaluate the condition of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy and to explore the effect of Yoga on it.,"After the completion of Yoga, 100 breast cancer patients with CRF (CFS&gt;0) were selected and were randomly divided into the Yoga group and the control group (n=50). Patients in the control group only received routine cure and care while patients in the Yoga group received extra Yoga exercise, lasting for 4 months. Cancer fatigue scale (CFS) was evaluated in the 2nd, 4th and 6th round of chemotherapy.","At the end, 82 cases qualified for the study, 42 cases for the control group and 40 for the Yoga group. The mean score of body fatigue was 12.67\u00b13.46. There was no significant difference in CRF between the Yago group and the control group before the Yoga intervention (P&gt;0.05). After the 4th round of chemotherapy, the mean scores of CFS and body fatigue in the Yoga group were significantly lower than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05). After the 6th round of chemotherapy, the mean scores of CFS, body fatigue and cognitive fatigue in the Yoga group were lower than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05). Repeated analysis of variance showed that the difference in the overall fatigue, body fatigue and cognitive fatigue between the Yoga group and the control group was significant (P&lt;0.05); the time influence on the overall fatigue, body fatigue and emotional fatigue was significant difference between the 2 groups (P&lt;0.05); there were interactions between the effect of Yago and time on the overall fatigue, body fatigue and cognitive fatigue (P&lt;0.05).","The body fatigue was more serious in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy. Yoga intervention could significantly reduce body fatigue, cognitive fatigue, thus reduce the overall fatigue in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy."
91,28374663,"The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of meaning-centered group psychotherapy for cancer survivors (MCGP-CS) to improve personal meaning, compared with supportive group psychotherapy (SGP) and care as usual (CAU).","A total of 170 cancer survivors were randomly assigned to one of the three study arms: MCGP-CS (n = 57); SGP (n = 56); CAU (n = 57). The primary outcome measure was the Personal Meaning Profile (PMP; total score). Secondary outcome measures were subscales of the PMP, psychological well-being (Scales of Psychological Well-being; SPWB), post-traumatic growth (Posttraumatic Growth Inventory), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC), optimism (Life Orientation Test-Revised), hopelessness (Beck's Hopelessness Scale), psychological distress (anxiety and depression, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) and quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire; EORTC QLQ-C30). Outcome measures were assessed before randomization, post-intervention, and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up (FU).","Linear mixed model analyses (intention-to-treat) showed significant differences between MCGP-CS, SGP and CAU on the total PMP score, and on (sub)scales of the PMP, SPWB, MAC and HADS. Post-hoc analyses showed significantly stronger treatment effects of MCGP-CS compared with CAU on personal meaning (d = 0.81), goal-orientedness (d = 1.07), positive relations (d = 0.59), purpose in life (d = 0.69); fighting spirit (d = 0.61) (post-intervention) and helpless/hopeless (d = -0.87) (3 months FU); and distress (d = -0.6) and depression (d = -0.38) (6 months FU).

92,17212568,To evaluate the efficacy of electroacupuncture in preventing anthracycline-based chemotherapy-related nausea and emesis refractory to combination 5HT(3)-antagonist and dexamethasone.,Cancer patients with refractory emesis after their first cycle of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy were accrued into this study. Electroacupuncture was given during the second cycle of chemotherapy. Each patient was evaluated for the number of emetic episodes and grade of nausea within the first 24 hours after chemotherapy and electroacupuncture.,"Forty-seven of a total of 317 patients screened were eligible for this study. Of these, 27 patients agreed to participate. Twenty-six (26; 96.3%) of them had significant reduction in both nausea grade and episodes of vomiting after electroacupuncture. There was complete response with no emetic episodes in 37%. Subjectively, 25 (92.6%) of the total 27 patients believed that acupuncture was an acceptable procedure and was helpful in reducing emesis. Electroacupuncture was well-tolerated with a median pain score of 3 of 10.",Electroacupuncture is well-tolerated and effective as an adjunct in reducing chemotherapy-related nausea and emesis.
93,12964131,We prospectively evaluated the effects of a six-session psychoeducational intervention held by medical doctors or psychologists in a German acute cancer center setting.,"A cluster randomization was used to assign n=108 oncologic patients (55 female, 53 male; mean age=58.5) to the intervention or the control group. The self-rated amount of information about cancer-specific topics, quality of life (EORTC), coping (TSK) and anxiety and depression (HAD-S) were measured at the beginning of the intervention (t0) as well as two and four months later (t1).","At t1 the level of information related to different aspects of cancer (p&lt;0.01) and &quot;emotional functioning&quot; (EORTC; p&lt;0.05) were clearly improved in the intervention vs. the control group. At t2 intervention group patients again showed an increased level of information (p&lt;0.05) and more emotional stability (p&lt;0.05). In addition, reduced rumination was seen in patients of the intervention but not the control group (TSK; p=0.01).",This study provides evidence that even short interdisciplinary psychoeducational interventions can at least improve the level of cancer-related information while hardly denting the budget of any healthcare system.
94,24596359,The aim of the study was to investigate how tailored exercise is experienced by cancer survivors.,"Twenty-five breast cancer survivors who were recently treated with systemic adjuvant treatments attended tailored exercise classes as a part of a randomized controlled exercise intervention study (Breast Cancer and Exercise, BREX). Focus group discussions with a median of four (range 3-6) participants in each group were conducted to capture their individual experiences of their course of illness, taking part in the exercise trial, the personal meaning of tailored exercise classes and the group.","Attending the intervention in which the focus of attention was on physical rehabilitation was highly valued, since the participants experienced both improved physical fitness and improved coping. Due to altered physical appearance and poor physical fitness, the participants felt that tailored exercise for patients with breast cancer reduced their barrier to start exercising. Peer support from the group was valued, especially that of sharing experiences, receiving psychological support and gaining a sense of normality. A sense of mastery over their disease through participating in the intervention, i.e. better psychological functioning and improved mood, was a consequence of better physical fitness and of meeting other breast cancer survivors. Also participating in the study per se increases a sense of comfort and security with extra medical examinations and follow-up.","Participating in the tailored exercise group for breast cancer survivors helped patients gain a sense of mastery, restoring their self-esteem and constructing a meaning for their cancer experience and its impact on their lives."
95,16511899,Decision aids are tools that help patients make specific and deliberative choices among options. This study was a group randomized controlled trial of a novel decision aid to help patients with breast cancer make adjuvant therapy (AT) decisions.,"Fourteen oncology practices (n=58 physicians) were randomized to receive the decision aid or a control pamphlet. Complete data were obtained from 405 patient-oncologist pairs. Eligible patients had stage I-III disease and had completed their primary treatment. The decision aid is a simple to use computer program, titled Adjuvant!, that provides estimates of outcome with and without AT. Graphical representations of outcome are shared with patients. Consultations were audiotaped, patients interviewed, and physicians completed a self-administered survey.","In a multivariable model, the 54 patients (13.3%) who took no AT were more likely to have received the decision aid (p=0.02). A differential effect of the Adjuvant! Decision Guide was noted between node negative and positive patients. It was stated by 86.2% of patients that the decision aid was influential when making their treatment decision. Over 95% of patients reported that the Adjuvant Decision Guide was easy to understand and 75% of physicians believed that it helped them understand their patient's treatment preferences and 81.4% reported the information as useful for themselves.",This study showed that a decision aid made a difference in the choice of whether or not to take AT. The decision aid allowed patients and physicians to consider the benefits of AT in an easy to understand format. Treatment decisions were more individualized for patients in the intervention than in the control group. The use of the decision aid was acceptable to both patients and physicians.
96,18006923,Epidemiologic studies provide evidence that exercise is associated with reduced risk of colon cancer. Exercise may exert protective effects on the colon by influencing prostaglandin production. We hypothesized that an exercise intervention would decrease prostaglandin E(2) concentrations and increase prostaglandin F(2alpha) in colon biopsies compared with controls.,"A 12-month randomized controlled trial testing the effects of exercise on colon mucosal prostaglandin concentrations was conducted in men (n=95) and women (n=89). The exercise intervention included moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity, 60 min/d, 6 days/wk versus controls. Prostaglandin E(2) and F(2alpha) concentrations were measured in colon biopsies using an enzyme-linked immunoassay at baseline and at 12 months to assess changes in mean concentration for each group.","Baseline colon prostaglandin E(2) and F(2alpha) concentrations were not correlated with age, race, education, family history of colon cancer, previous polyps, body size, diet, smoking, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use, metabolic factors, or sex hormone levels. For both men and women, the exercise and control groups showed no change in mean prostaglandin E(2) or F(2alpha) between the baseline and 12-month biopsies. There was no difference in mean prostaglandin concentrations between exercisers and controls when exercisers were grouped by level of intervention adherence. Results were not modified by baseline age, body mass index, percentage of body fat, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use, history of adenomatous polyps, or family history of colon cancer.",A 12-month moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise intervention did not result in significant changes in colon mucosal prostaglandin concentrations.
97,10553972,"Aminoleban EN contains branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and is known to be beneficial for the protein-energy malnutrition in cirrhotic patients. Patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma often have background cirrhosis, and the present study investigates the effect of Aminoleban EN on these patients after hepatic resection for the primary disease.","A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, to which 50 patients were recruited, was carried out. The study group received Aminoleban EN in addition to normal diet for 12 weeks and the control group received an isonitrogenous and isocaloric diet only.","After exclusions, there were 21 patients in the study group and 23 patients in the control. The study group had a shorter hospital stay, and had a significantly higher haemoglobin level, higher sodium level, higher albumin level and lower bilirubin during the postoperative course. There was no significant difference in terms of neuropsychiatric symptoms or Karnofsky performance score. There was no difference in gastrointestinal symptoms or other signs. No adverse reaction was associated with the administration of Aminoleban, and there was no significant difference in terms of morbidity and mortality between the two groups of patients.",Aminoleban EN is safe to administer and does not have significant adverse effects. It contributes to a shorter hospital stay and quicker improvement of liver function in the early postoperative period. These beneficial results require only a 12-week period of administration of BCAA after operation.
98,15684319,"To investigate the impact of dietary counseling or nutritional supplements on outcomes in cancer patients: nutritional, morbidity, and quality of life (QoL) during and 3 months after radiotherapy.","A total of 111 colorectal cancer outpatients referred for radiotherapy, stratified by staging, were randomly assigned: group 1 (G1; n = 37), dietary counseling (regular foods); group 2 (G2; n = 37), protein supplements; and group 3 (G3; n = 37), ad libitum intake. Nutritional intake (diet history), status (Ottery's Subjective Global Assessment), and QoL (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0) were evaluated at baseline, at the end, and 3 months after radiotherapy.","At radiotherapy completion, energy intake increased in G1/G2 (P &lt; or = .04), G1 more than G2 (P = .001), and decreased in G3 (P &lt; .01). Protein intake increased in G1/G2 (P &lt; or = .007), G1 less than G2 (not significant), and decreased in G3 (P &lt; .01). At 3 months, G1 maintained nutritional intake and G2/G3 returned to baseline. After radiotherapy and at 3 months, rates of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were higher in G3 (P &lt; .05). At radiotherapy completion, in G1 all QoL function scores improved proportionally to adequate intake or nutritional status (P &lt; .05); whereas in G2 only three of six function scores improved proportionally to protein intake (P = .04), and in G3 all scores worsened (P &lt; .05). At 3 months, G1 patients maintained/improved function, symptoms, and single-item scores (P &lt; .02); in G2, only few function and symptom scales improved (P &lt; .05); in G3, QoL remained as poor as after radiotherapy. In G1/G2, respectively, improvement/deterioration of QoL correlated with better or poorer intake or nutritional status (P &lt; .003).","During radiotherapy, both interventions positively influenced outcomes; dietary counseling was of similar or higher benefit, whereas even 3 months after RT, it was the only method to sustain a significant impact on patient outcomes."
99,27135464,"Long-term chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) affects a large number of cancer survivors. To the authors' knowledge, to date there is no established treatment for this survivorship problem. The authors herein report results of a small randomized controlled trial of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT), compared with an attention control condition. Both treatments were delivered over a videoconference device.","A total of 47 survivors of female breast cancer who reported CRCD were randomized to MAAT or supportive therapy and were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at 2 months of follow-up. Participants completed self-report measures of cognitive symptoms and quality of life and a brief telephone-based neuropsychological assessment.","MAAT participants made gains in perceived (self-reported) cognitive impairments (P = .02), and neuropsychological processing speed (P = .03) compared with supportive therapy controls. A large MAAT effect size was observed at the 2-month follow-up with regard to anxiety concerning cognitive problems (Cohen's d for standard differences in effect sizes, 0.90) with medium effects noted in general function, fatigue, and anxiety. Survivors rated MAAT and videoconference delivery with high satisfaction.",MAAT may be an efficacious psychological treatment of CRCD that can be delivered through videoconference technology. This research is important because it helps to identify a treatment option for survivors that also may improve access to survivorship services.

100,9128987,"Fatigue and loss of physical performance are frequent problems of cancer patients. In a pilot study, the authors evaluated the feasibility and effects of aerobic training in the rehabilitation of cancer patients after completing high dose chemotherapy.","Sixteen patients participated in a specially designed rehabilitation program for 6 weeks. The patients entered the program, which consisted of walking on a treadmill, shortly after completing treatment. Sixteen patients who did not train served as controls. Physical performance (maximum speed on the treadmill test), cardiac function, and hemoglobin concentration were compared at the time of discharge from the hospital and 7 weeks later. At the second examination, fatigue and limitations in daily activities due to impaired endurance were assessed during personal interviews.","At the time of discharge from the hospital, maximum physical performance (training group: 6.2 +/- 1.1 km/hour; controls: 6.2 +/- 1.3 km/hour) and hemoglobin concentration (training group: 10.1 +/- 1.4 g/dL; controls: 10.1 +/- 1.2 g/dL) were similar for both groups. After 7 weeks, improvement in maximum physical performance (training group: 8.3 +/- 1.6 km/hour; controls 7.5 +/- 1.3 km/hour) and hemoglobin concentration (training group: 13 +/- 1 g/dL controls: 12 +/- 1.4 g/dL) were significantly higher for the training group (P &lt; 0.05). By the second examination, no patient in the training group but 4 controls (25%) reported fatigue and limitations in daily activities due to low physical performance.","Aerobic exercise improves the physical performance of cancer patients recovering from high dose chemotherapy. To reduce fatigue, this group of patients should be counseled to increase physical activity rather than rest after treatment."
101,24012579,"The second most frequently reported post-treatment symptom in cancer survivors are concerns about impaired cognition. Despite numerous studies demonstrating significant impairments in a portion of survivors, information on effective treatments remains an emerging area of research. This study examined the effectiveness of a group-based cognitive rehabilitation intervention in cancer survivors.","This study was a randomized, controlled study of a 7-week cognitive rehabilitation intervention delivered in group format. Participants were evaluated with subjective symptom questionnaires and objective neurocognitive tests prior to and following treatment.","Twenty-eight participants (mean age 58 years) with a median of 3 years (\u00b1 6 years) post-primary/adjuvant treatment and various cancer sites (breast, bladder, prostate, colon, uterine) completed the study. Compared to baseline, the treatment group demonstrated improvements in symptoms of perceived cognitive impairments (p&lt;.01), cognitive abilities (p&lt;.01) and overall quality of life with regard to cognitive symptoms (p&lt;.01) as measured by the FACT-Cog. The treatment group also improved on objective measures of attention (p&lt;.05) and a trend toward improvement on verbal memory. Significant improvement was not observed on all cognitive tests.",A group based cognitive rehabilitation intervention in cancer survivors was effective for improving attention abilities and overall quality of life related to cognition. Results suggest that group based cognitive rehabilitation may be an effective intervention for treating cognitive dysfunction in cancer patients and should be further studied in a larger trial with an active control condition.
102,14524485,The aim of the study was to assess whether the oral intake of cranberry juice cocktail compared with apple juice was associated with a significant difference in urinary symptoms experienced during radical external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for prostate carcinoma.,One hundred and twelve men with prostate cancer were randomised to either 354 ml cranberry juice or apple juice a day. Stratification was based on a history of a previous transurethral resection of prostate (TURP yes/no) and baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS &lt; 6 or &gt; or = 6) of urinary symptoms.,"The maximum IPSS (MRT) and the maximum change in IPSS from baseline (DRT) are used to report the results. We analysed the effects of juice allocation on DRT and MRT using analysis of covariates (ANCOVA). We observed no significant difference for DRT (P = 0.39) or MRT (P = 0.76) related to the consumption of cranberry compared with apple juice. However, we found a significant relationship between the history of a previous TURP and both DRT (P = 0.01) and MRT (P = 0.01). The history of a previous TURP was associated with lower values for both end points. Baseline IPSS was significant for DRT (P = 0.004) and MRT (P &lt; or = 0.001). We found a significant relationship between the baseline IPSS &lt; 6 or &gt; or = 6 cut point on MRT (P &lt; or = 0.001) but not on DRT (P = 0.43). The use of neoadjuvant hormones had no significant effect on DRT (P = 0.64) or MRT (P = 0.76). The use of additional symptomatic medication during the study was not significantly different between the two arms.",This study shows no significant difference in the urinary symptoms experienced during EBRT related to the consumption of cranberry juice compared with apple juice.
103,30293230,"Breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapies face risks of relapse, increased rates of cardiovascular events, and toxicities of therapy such as aromatase inhibitor (AI)-associated musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS). C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for inflammation, is associated with breast cancer outcomes. We evaluated whether the olive-derived polyphenol hydroxytyrosol combined with omega-3 fatty acids and curcumin would reduce CRP and musculoskeletal symptoms in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant hormonal therapies.","This prospective, multicenter, open-label, single arm, clinical trial enrolled post-menopausal breast cancer patients (n\u2009=\u200945) with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) taking predominantly aromatase inhibitors to receive a combination of hydroxytyrosol, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin for 1 month. CRP, other inflammation-associated cytokines, and pain scores on the Brief Pain Inventory were measured before therapy, at the end of therapy and 1 month after completion of therapy.","CRP levels declined during the therapy [from 8.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u00a0mg/L at baseline to 5.3\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2\u00a0mg/L (p\u2009=\u20090.014) at 30\u00a0days of treatment], and remained decreased during the additional 1 month off therapy. Subjects with the highest baseline CRP levels had the greatest decrease with the therapy. Pain scores also decreased during the therapy. There were no significant adverse events.","The combination of hydroxytyrosol, omega-3 fatty acids, and curcumin reduced inflammation as indicated by a reduction in CRP and reduced pain in patients with aromatase-induced musculoskeletal symptoms. Longer studies comparing this combination to other anti-inflammatories in larger groups of patients with clinical outcome endpoints are warranted."
104,11973949,The objective of this study was to determine whether reflexology has an impact on the quality of life of patients in the palliative stage of cancer.,"Twelve patients in the palliative stage of cancer with various tumour types were randomised into two groups. They were randomly assigned to receive either reflexology or placebo reflexology. All participants completed a linear analogue self-assessment scale relating to quality of life. All participants then received three sessions of either reflexology or placebo reflexology. The same person, a qualified reflexologist, provided the interventions for both groups. The participants were not aware of which intervention they were receiving. All participants then completed a second linear analogue self-assessment scale relating to quality of life.","All participants felt that their quality of life had improved, even those who had received the placebo treatment. The reflexology group, however, reported more benefit than the placebo group. There was a significant difference (p = 0.004) between the reflexology group and the placebo group.",This study showed that reflexology does have an impact on the quality of life of patients in the palliative stage of cancer.
105,26643400,Colorectal cancer (CRC) may have a negative impact on a person's quality of life. Psycho-educational interventions for patients with CRC are rarely studied. The purpose of this feasibility trial was to evaluate the effect of a psycho-educational programme (PEP) on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of patients treated for CRC and anal cancer.,"Patients with CRC and anal cancer were randomly assigned to a PEP (n = 47) or standard treatment (n = 39). The PEP included informative lectures, discussion, and reflection. HRQL was evaluated using the SF-36 at baseline and 1, 6, and 12 months after the end of the PEP.",Patients in the PEP group had significantly better Mental Health scores after 1 month and significantly better Bodily Pain scores after 6 months compared with patients who received standard care.,The results of this study indicate that a PEP can have a short-term effect on the mental health and bodily pain of patients treated for CRC and anal cancer when comparing with a control group. The article discusses the methodological difficulties of evaluating an intervention such as this PEP in a clinical setting.
106,22430268,"To assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for mood, breast- and endocrine-specific quality of life, and well-being after hospital treatment in women with stage 0 to III breast cancer.","A randomized, wait-listed, controlled trial was carried out in 229 women after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to the 8-week MBSR program or standard care. Profile of Mood States (POMS; primary outcome), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) scales and the WHO five-item well-being questionnaire (WHO-5) evaluated mood, quality of life, and well-being at weeks 0, 8, and 12. For each outcome measure, a repeated-measures analysis of variance model, which incorporated week 0 measurements as a covariate, was used to compare treatment groups at 8 and 12 weeks.","There were statistically significant improvements in outcome in the experimental group compared with control group at both 8 and 12 weeks (except as indicated) for POMS total mood disturbance (and its subscales of anxiety, depression [8 weeks only], anger [12 weeks only], vigor, fatigue, and confusion [8 weeks only]), FACT-B, FACT-ES, (and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy subscales of physical, social [8 weeks only], emotional, and functional well-being), and WHO-5.","MSBR improved mood, breast- and endocrine-related quality of life, and well-being more effectively than standard care in women with stage 0 to III breast cancer, and these results persisted at three months. To our knowledge, this study provided novel evidence that MBSR can help alleviate long-term emotional and physical adverse effects of medical treatments, including endocrine treatments. MBSR is recommended to support survivors of breast cancer."
107,10322830,To investigate the effects of Modified Sijunzi decoction (MSJZD) in treating gastric pre-cancerous lesion.,"Two hundreds and two patients with chronic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia (IM) of gastric mucosa diagnosed by gastroscopy and pathological examination of biopsy were divided into 2 groups, 117 cases of the treatment group were treated with MSJZD and 85 cases of the control group were treated with Weimeisu. For both groups, re-examination was taken after a 3-month treatment.","The cure rate and total effective rate of IM in the treatment group were 55.6% and 87.2% respectively, while in the control group were 11.8% and 55.3% respectively (P &lt; 0.01).",The intestinal metaplasia process of gastric mucosa is reversible and MSJZD has good effect on it. This study provided a new way of pre-cancerous lesion treatment and gastric cancer prevention.
108,12923794,"We conducted a randomised, controlled trial of cognitive-existential group therapy (CEGT) for women with early stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with the aim of improving mood and mental attitude to cancer.","Women were randomised to 20 sessions of weekly group therapy plus 3 relaxation classes or to a control arm receiving 3 relaxation classes. Assessments, independently done at baseline, 6 and 12 months, included a structured psychiatric interview and validated questionnaires covering mood, attitudes to cancer, family relationships, and satisfaction with therapy.","Three hundred and three of 491 (62%) eligible patients participated over 3 years. Distress was high pre-intervention: 10% were diagnosed as suffering from major depression, 27% from minor depression and 9% from anxiety disorders. On an intention-to-treat analysis, there was a trend for those receiving group therapy (n=154) to have reduced anxiety (p=0.05, 2-sided) compared to controls (n=149). Women in group therapy also showed a trend towards improved family functioning compared to controls (p=0.07, 2-sided). The women in the groups reported greater satisfaction with their therapy (p&lt;0.001, 2-sided), appreciating the support and citing better coping, self-growth and increased knowledge about cancer and its treatment. They valued the CEGT therapy. Overall effect size for the group intervention was small (d=0.25), with cancer recurrence having a deleterious effect in three of the 19 therapy groups. Psychologists as a discipline achieved a moderate mean effect size (d=0.52).","CEGT is a useful adjuvant psychological therapy for women with early stage breast cancer. Interaction effects between group members and therapists are relevant to outcome. Group-as-a-whole effects are powerful, but the training and experience of the therapist is especially critical to an efficacious outcome."
109,9640900,"To evaluate a psychoeducational intervention program for parents of pediatric cancer patients, using cognitive and behavioral techniques.","Parents were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 39) and a control condition (n = 42). Baseline assessment took place at diagnosis. Short-term effects were measured immediately after the intervention, long-term effects six months later. Control parents received standard care. Intervention parents received, in addition, a manual-guided program during the first six months following the diagnosis.","With time all parents became significantly less psychologically distressed. However, no between-group differences were noted in psychological functioning, satisfaction with support, and intensity of emotions immediately postintervention and six months later.","Although the clinical evaluation of the intervention was positive, it appeared that a structured intervention program as described in this study was not any more effective than standard care."
110,17879970,"No study has yet assessed the impact of physicians' skills acquisition after a communication skills training program on changes in patients' and relatives' anxiety following a three-person medical consultation. This study aimed at comparing, in a randomized study, the impact, on patients' and relatives' anxiety, of a basic communication skills training program and the same program consolidated by consolidation workshops and at investigating physicians' communication variables associated with patients' and relatives' anxiety.",Consultations with a cancer patient and a relative were recorded and analyzed by the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop Evaluation Manual. Patients' and relatives' anxiety were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State.,"No statistically significant change over time and between groups was observed. Mixed-effects modeling of changes in patients' and relatives' anxiety showed that decreases in both patients' and relatives' anxiety were linked with patients' and relatives' self-reported distress (p = 0.031 and 0.005), and that increases in both patients' and relatives' anxiety were linked with physicians' breaking bad news (p = 0.028 and 0.005).",No impact of the training program was observed. Results indicate the need to further study communication skills which may help reduce patients' and relatives' anxiety especially when breaking bad news.
111,27644672,Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) places a significant burden on the patient. Herbal agents are the most commonly complementary therapies used among the public. This study was done to determine the effect of ginger and chamomile capsules on nausea and vomiting in cases undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer (BC).,"In a randomized, double-blind and clinical trial study, 65 women with BC undergoing chemotherapy were referred to Breast Cancer Research Center, Tehran, Iran, between May 2013 to June 2014. Regimen for ginger group for 5 days before and 5 days after chemotherapy was: 2 times a day and 500 mg capsules of powdered ginger root in addition to a routine antiemetic regimen consisting of dexamethasone, metoclopramide and aprepitant (DMA) capsules. Chamomile group similarly was: 2 times a day and 500 mg capsules of Matricaria chamomilla extract in addition to a routine antiemetic regimen consisting of DMA capsules. Control group, routine antiemetic regimen consisting of DMA capsules.","There were no significant differences between the ginger, chamomile and control groups regarding age. Drugs used for chemotherapy were identical and duration of disease was also matched (1-4 months). Ginger and chamomile were both significantly effective for reducing the frequency of vomiting, there being no significant difference between the ginger and chamomile groups. Moreover, unlike the chamomile, ginger significantly influenced the frequency of nausea.","According to the findings of this study, it should be declared that taking ginger capsules (1 g/day) might relieve CINV safely. Nurses dealing directly with cancer patients should be responsible for providing educational programs for patients and their families about how to deal with their drug regimens and associated side effects."
112,17001492,"To evaluate a 12-week home-based walking intervention among breast cancer survivors and to quantify changes in physical activity (PA) behaviors, body weight, and body composition in response to the intervention.","Breast cancer survivors that were in the posttreatment period were randomized to intervention (n=23) or wait-list usual care (n=13). PA was assessed by self-report, and in a study subsample (n=23), by an accelerometer. Intention to treat principles were employed to estimate the intervention effect on PA behaviors, body weight, and body composition. Intervention adherence was calculated as the proportion of exercise sessions completed relative to the number of exercise sessions recommended, as reported each week on walking logs.","Thirty-four of 36 women randomized (94%) completed the study. Average intervention adherence over 12 weeks was 94%. Intervention participants reported a significantly greater increase in walking for exercise [+11.9 metabolic equivalent (MET)-h/week] over time than did usual care participants (+1.7 MET-h/week, p=0.01). Objective measures of activity also indicated that intervention participants increased their activity levels over time as compared to usual care participants [i.e., counts/min/day and steps/day (p&lt; or =0.04)]. No significant changes in body weight or composition were observed.",We found that a 12-week home-based walking intervention was safe and effective for increasing short-term PA levels in breast cancer survivors. Future studies are needed to assess the ability of brief interventions to facilitate the maintenance of increased activity levels and to produce favorable quality of life and risk factor outcomes.
113,15743368,"Internal medicine residents are deficient in their knowledge about familial colorectal cancer (CRC) and thus unable to comply with appropriate screening guidelines. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mixed educational program that incorporates both a didactic lecture (DL) and interactive, case-based seminar (ICBS), plus distribution of a personal digital assistant (PDA)-based risk assessment tool.","Internal medicine resident continuity care teams were randomly assigned to an intervention (9 teams; 43 residents) or control (11 teams; 39 residents) arm. Both groups participated in a DL addressing the current status of CRC screening for average, moderate, and high-risk groups. Intervention teams also participated in a 1-h pre-clinic ICBS that included vignettes about patients at moderate or high risk of CRC because of family history, following which they received the risk assessment tool by e-mail. Knowledge and clinical risk assessment skills were evaluated using pre/posttests, patient exit interviews, and chart audits.","Baseline test scores were similar for both groups (intervention, 51%vs control, 54%; p= 0.35). Immediate post-ICBS scores (intervention group only) significantly increased to 82% (p &lt; 0.001). Six-month post-ICBS scores declined for the intervention group but remained significantly higher than 6-month control group scores (63%vs 56%, p= 0.002), which were unchanged from baseline. No significant differences were observed with respect to family history-taking or documentation skills.",A mixed educational program that incorporates both a DL and ICBS is more effective that the DL alone for increasing knowledge about familial CRC risk but may have limited influence on clinical risk assessment skills.
114,16701923,"Nutritional status frequently deteriorates during chemotherapy in cancer. This is associated with a poor outcome. Since creatine supplementation has shown promising results in various diseases, we investigated the effects of creatine on nutritional status in patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy.","Thirty patients with colorectal cancer undergoing chemotherapy were randomised to receive either creatine (n=16) or placebo (n=15) for 8 weeks. Body composition was determined with bioelectrical impedance analysis; muscle function by hand grip, hip flexion and knee extension strength and quality of life (QoL) was assessed by the QLQ30 questionnaire.","Neither muscle function, body cell mass (BCM) nor QoL improved, but phase angle, a marker of BCM and cell integrity, increased significantly in the intervention patients (5.3+/-0.3 degrees to 5.4+/-0.2 degrees , P=0.030). Evaluating patients with different chemotherapy regimens, however, only intervention patients undergoing less aggressive chemotherapy were shown to benefit, increasing phase angle (5.11+/-0.22 degrees to 5.51+/-0.30 degrees , P=0.043) as well as BCM (27.22+/-2.85 to 29.60+/-3.54kg, P=0.043).",Creatine failed to improve muscle mass or function and QoL in colorectal cancer patients but improved bioimpedance parameters that are predictive of poor outcome. Creatine might therefore be useful in patients with milder chemotherapy in order to maintain or increase BCM whereas patients undergoing aggressive chemotherapy however are not likely to benefit.
115,17535624,"Allogeneic blood transfusion confers a risk to the recipient. Recent trials in colorectal surgery have shown that the most significant factors predicting blood transfusion are pre-operative haemoglobin, operative blood loss and presence of a transfusion protocol. We report a randomised, controlled trial of oral ferrous sulphate 200 mg TDS for 2 weeks' pre-operatively versus no iron therapy.",Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer were recruited from out-patient clinic and haematological parameters assessed. Randomisation was co-ordinated via a telephone randomisation centre.,"Of the 49 patients recruited, 45 underwent colorectal resection. There were no differences between those patients not receiving iron (n = 23) and the iron-supplemented group (n = 22) for haemoglobin at recruitment, operative blood loss, operation duration or length of hospital stay. At admission to hospital, the iron-supplemented group had a higher haemoglobin than the non-iron treated group (mean haemoglobin concentration 13.1 g/dl [range, 9.6-17 g/dl] versus 11.8 g/dl [range, 7.8-14.7 g/dl]; P = 0.040; 95% CI 0.26-0.97) and were less likely to require operative blood transfusion (mean 0 U [range, 0-4 U] versus 2 U [range, 0-11 U] transfused; P = 0.031; 95% CI 0.13-2.59). This represented a cost reduction of 66% (47 U of blood = pound4700 versus oral FeSO(4) at pound30 + 15 U blood at pound1500). At admission, ferritin in the iron-treated group had risen significantly from 40 microg/l (range, 15-222 microg/l) to 73 microg/l (range, 27-386 microg/l; P = 0.0036; 95% CI 46.53-10.57).","Oral ferrous sulphate given pre-operatively in patients undergoing colorectal surgery offers a simple, inexpensive method of reducing blood transfusions."
116,24131320,Clinical outcomes of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) calcium plus vitamin D supplementation trial have been reported during 7.0 years of active intervention. We now report outcomes 4.9 years after the intervention stopped and cumulative findings.,"Postmenopausal women (N=36,282) were randomized; postintervention follow-up continued among 29,862 (86%) of surviving participants. Primary outcomes were hip fracture and colorectal cancer. Breast cancer, all cancers, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and total mortality were predetermined major study outcomes.","Hip fracture incidence was comparable in the supplement and the placebo groups, postintervention hazard ratio (HR)=0.95, 95% confidence interval (95% CI: 0.78, 1.15) and overall HR=0.91 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.05). Overall, colorectal cancer incidence did not differ between randomization groups, HR=0.95 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.13). Throughout, there also was no difference in invasive breast cancer, CVD, and all-cause mortality between groups. In subgroup analyses, the invasive breast cancer effect varied by baseline vitamin D intake (p=0.03 for interaction). Women with vitamin D intakes &gt;600 IU/d, had an increased risk of invasive breast cancer, HR=1.28 (95% CI; 1.03, 1.60). Over the entire study period, in post hoc analyses, the incidence of vertebral fractures, HR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.98) and in situ breast cancers, HR=0.82 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.99) were lower among women randomized to supplementation.","After an average of 11 years, calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not decrease hip fracture or colorectal cancer incidence. Exploratory analyses found lower vertebral fracture and in situ breast cancer incidence in the supplement users. There was no effect on CVD or all-cause mortality."
117,15207987,Results are reported from a randomized trial designed to increase the accuracy of perceived breast cancer risk among callers to the NCI's Cancer Information Service (CIS) (n = 392).,CIS callers assigned to the intervention group (n = 200) received a brief educational intervention and an estimate of breast cancer risk over the telephone at the end of usual service. Follow-up interviews were completed by telephone at 1 month (n = 367).,"On average, women overestimated their risk by 25 percentage points. Eighty percent of the respondents rated their risk of breast cancer higher than did the assessment tool. Women rated their risk higher if they were under age 50 (P = 0.025) or had a first-degree family history of breast cancer (P = 0.0001), and rated their risk lower if they were Latina (P = 0.050) or Asian/other race/ethnicity (P = 0.013). Women with a first-degree family history of breast cancer in the intervention group significantly reduced their risk overestimate compared to those in the control group (-12.5 vs. 2.8 percentage points, P = 0.006).",This intervention was unique because it was delivered in an ongoing service setting. It should be further tested in diverse populations.
118,12590989,Recent increases in mammography use have led to a decrease in mortality from breast cancer.,"Building on the Health Belief Model, the Transtheoretical Model, and past effectiveness of tailored interventions, we conducted a prospective randomized trial (n = 773) to test the efficacy on mammography adherence of tailored interventions delivered by five different methods, i.e., telephone counseling, in-person counseling, physician letter, and combinations of telephone with letter and in-person with letter.","All five interventions increased mammography adherence significantly relative to usual care (odds ratios, 1.93 to 3.55) at 6 months post intervention. The combination of in-person with physician letter was significantly more effective than telephone alone or letter alone. Women thinking about getting a mammogram at baseline were more likely to be adherent by 6 months; even those in usual care achieved 48% adherence compared with 50-70% in the intervention groups. In contrast, women not thinking about getting a mammogram needed the interventions to increase their adherence from 13% to over 30%.",All five interventions were effective at increasing mammography adherence. Women not thinking about getting a mammogram were most likely to benefit from these tailored interventions while other women might need less intensive interventions.
119,22576981,"When diagnosed with breast cancer, most women's lives change as well as their perspectives on and appreciation of life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether psychosocial support intervention could influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and fatigue during the first year after diagnosis.","Of 382 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, 191 patients were randomized to an intervention group and 191 patients were randomized to a routine control group. The intervention group received support intervention that lasted 1 week on a residential basis, followed by 4 days of follow-up 2 months later. The support intervention included informative educational parts, relaxation training, mental visualization, and nonverbal communication. HRQOL was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires and fatigue with the Norwegian version of the fatigue scale at baseline and at 2, 6, and 12 months after intervention.","There was a time-dependent improvement in both functional and symptom scales between baseline and 12 months as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR23 questionnaires and there was a decrease in fatigue between baseline and after 2 months with further improvement up to 12 months in both groups, but there were no differences between the intervention and control groups at any point in time.","HRQOL improves and symptoms of fatigue decrease over time, but we could not see any additional effect from the rehabilitation program in this setting."
120,10458255,Pain and symptom management is an integral part of the clinical practice of oncology. A number of guidelines have been developed to assist the clinician in optimizing comfort care. We implemented clinical guidelines for cancer pain management in the community setting and evaluated whether these guidelines improved care.,"Eighty-one cancer patients, aged 37 to 76 years, were enrolled onto a prospective, longitudinal, randomized controlled study from the outpatient clinic settings of 26 western Washington-area medical oncologists. A multilevel treatment algorithm based on the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Guidelines for Cancer Pain Management was compared with standard-practice (control) pain and symptom management therapies used by community oncologists. The primary outcome of interest was pain (Brief Pain Inventory); secondary outcomes of interest were all other symptoms (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale) and quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale).","Patients randomized to the pain algorithm group achieved a statistically significant reduction in usual pain intensity, measured as slope scores, when compared with standard community practice (P &lt; .02). Concurrent chemotherapy and patient adherence to treatment were significant mediators of worst pain. There were no significant differences in other symptoms or quality of life between the two treatment groups.",This guideline implementation study supports the use of algorithmic decision making in the management of cancer pain. These findings suggest that comprehensive pain assessment and evidence-based analgesic decision-making processes do enhance usual pain outcomes.
121,27635676,Obesity and diet quality are two distinct lifestyle factors associated with morbidity and mortality among breast cancer survivors. The purposes of this study were to examine diet quality changes during a weight loss intervention among breast cancer survivors and to examine whether diet quality change was an important factor related to weight loss.,"Participants were overweight/obese breast cancer survivors (n = 180) participating in a weight loss intervention. Diet quality scores were calculated using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2010. Paired sample t-tests were run to examine change in diet quality, and a latent difference model was constructed to examine whether change in diet quality was associated with weight change.","Participants significantly improved diet quality (P = 0.001) and lost 13.2 \u00b1 5.8% (mean \u00b1 SD) of their weight (P = 0.001). Six-month HEI score was significantly associated with weight loss, controlling for baseline BMI (P = 0.003). Improvement in diet quality was also significantly associated with weight loss (P = 0.01).","Our findings indicate that a weight loss intervention can result in both clinically significant weight loss and improvement in diet quality, and that improved diet quality is predictive of weight loss. Both weight loss and diet quality are implicated in longevity and quality of life for breast cancer survivors."
122,28196066,To assess the efficacy of a patient educational program built according to guidelines that aims at reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF).,"Randomised controlled trial, multicentre, comparing a patient education program, vs the standard of care. Patients were adult cancer outpatients with any tumour site. The primary outcome was fatigue severity assessed with a visual analogical scale (VAS), between the day of randomisation and week 7. Secondary outcomes were fatigue assessed with other scales, health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression. The time to fatigue severity deterioration was assessed. Analyses were performed in a modified intent-to-treat way, that is, including all patients with at least one baseline and 1 week 7 score.","A total of 212 patients were included. Fatigue severity assessment was made on 79 patients in the experimental group and 65 in the control group. Between randomisation and week 7, the fatigue (VAS) improved by 0.96 (2.85) points in the experimental group vs 1.63 (2.63) points in the control group (P=0.15). No differences with the secondary outcomes were highlighted between two groups. No other factors were found to be associated with fatigue severity deterioration.","Despite rigorous methodology, this study failed to highlight the program efficacy in fatigue reduction for cancer patients. Other assessment tools should be developed to measure the effect of the program on CRF and behaviour. The implementation of the program should also be explored in order to identify its mechanisms and longer-term impact."
123,15292625,"Despite improvements in the medical treatment of breast cancer, resulting in better prognoses, women diagnosed with the illness often experience psychosocial problems. As a result, many psychosocial intervention programs have been developed, usually with positive results. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of two 12-week psychosocial intervention programs for women with a primary, non-metastatic breast cancer diagnosis in comparison to women who were on a waiting list for these interventions for 3 months.","Sixty-nine women with primary, non-metastatic breast cancer, but otherwise without psychosocial problems, were randomized to a group of patients treated with the intervention program (group psychotherapy or social support group) or a control group (on a waiting list). Differences between both groups in psychosocial adjustment, social support and coping at the short-term follow-up were described in this study.",Women who participated in the group intervention programs did not differ from women in the control group regarding psychosocial adjustment at the end of the study. Women who participated in the social support groups reported to receive more social support from others not very close to them. They also used more palliative coping than women from the psychotherapy group.,"Apparently, women who are being diagnosed with breast cancer, but otherwise have no psychosocial adjustment problems following the diagnosis, do not especially benefit from a short-term intervention program compared to women in the control group."
124,14669295,"High-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) is a commonly used treatment for hematologic malignancies. The procedure causes significant psychological distress and no interventions have been demonstrated to improve mood in these patients. Music therapy has been shown to improve anxiety in a variety of acute medical settings. In the current study, the authors determined the effects of music therapy compared with standard care on mood during inpatient stays for HDT/ASCT.","Patients with hematologic malignancy admitted for HDT/ASCT at two sites (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Ireland Cancer Center in Cleveland, Ohio) were randomized to receive music therapy given by trained music therapists or standard care. Outcome was assessed at baseline and every 3 days after randomization using the Profile of Mood States.","Of 69 patients registered in the study, follow-up data were available for 62 (90%). During their inpatient stay, patients in the music therapy group scored 28% lower on the combined Anxiety/Depression scale (P = 0.065) and 37% lower (P = 0.01) on the total mood disturbance score compared with controls.",Music therapy is a noninvasive and inexpensive intervention that appears to reduce mood disturbance in patients undergoing HDT/ASCT.
125,8487062,In this study we tested some assumptions about the use of euphemism in communicating with cancer patients. Does an explicit statement about the diagnosis of cancer cause patients to respond with greater anxiety than when uncertainty or ambiguity is allowed to persist? Do patients believe they cope better with cancer when the diagnosis is explicit?,"A heterogeneous sample of 165 cancer patients completed a new measure of emotional adjustment to cancer using random assignment among four testing variables: agent (self-report v interview), terminology (the words cancer v illness), identification (patient identified v anonymous), and supervision (clinic v home). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) for the 39-item set was 0.74 and face and content validity were determined using the focus-group technique and preliminary factor analysis. After answering the adjustment measures, subjects completed the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).","Overall anxiety levels were significantly lower in the sample than published norms for general medical and surgical patients. Exposure to the word cancer as distinct from illness increased anxiety, but did not alter adjustment scores. Supervision and agent conditions did not affect anxiety, but reported adjustment was poorer in the interview condition compared with the self-report condition. Ambiguous instructions, such as asking patients to complete the questionnaire anonymously but return it in person to staff in the clinic, resulted in poorer adjustment, which was reversed by the consistent instruction to complete the questionnaire anonymously at home and return it by mail.","Use of the word cancer generated anxiety to levels similar to those reported in general medical and surgical patients, but did not produce any distortion in reported adjustment. However, any ambiguity associated with the conditions under which adjustment is assessed may lead to distortion and an increase in the patient's reported psychologic distress."
126,10730802,A pilot study of an intervention using nurse education for skin self-examination (SSE) was conducted in order to determine specific factors that would be important for the design of a larger intervention.,"Seventy-five subjects completed a pretest, a posttest, a thorough skin examination by a dermatologist, and an educational session by a nurse.",Results showed that the subjects increased the frequency of SSE to a predetermined optimal frequency of once every one to two months. Increases in optimal SSE were associated with increases in knowledge about melanoma (p = 0.006).,"Before intensive campaigns are launched to improve SSE, models incorporating theories of behavioral change should be tested."
127,22545977,This study is a secondary analysis examining the effects of a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention on indicators of positive psychological well-being and negative psychological well-being in HIV-positive racial/ethnic minority women at risk for cervical cancer due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and/or cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN).,"Racial/ethnic minority women with HIV and HPV and/or CIN I were randomized to a 10-week CBSM group or a 1-day psychoeducational seminar. Participants completed a battery of measures of positive and negative psychological well-being at 3 time points: preintervention, 3 months postenrollment, and 9 months postenrollment.","Women in the CBSM group reported significant increases in domains of positive well-being, with no changes among women in the psychoeducational seminar, F(6, 63) = 2.42, p &lt; .05, \u03b7\u00b2 = .19. There were no significant changes in domains of negative well-being across time for either group, F(2, 65) = 2.60, p = .08, \u03b7\u00b2 = .07.",These findings suggest that racial/ethnic minority women with HIV at risk for cervical cancer who were randomized to a 10-week CBSM group experienced enhanced positive well-being. The lack of effects on negative well-being may be due to the relatively low levels of negative well-being present in this sample at study entry. Future research should examine whether these effects are replicated in a randomized controlled trial of women with biopsy-confirmed CIN who present with greater distress levels that also employs a time-equivalent comparison condition.
128,23321934,"This study aims to explore gynecological cancer survivors' perceptions and experiences following participation in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of a home-based physical activity behavioral change intervention (Donnelly et al., Gynecol Oncol 122:618-624, 2011).","All participants completing a two-armed parallel RCT were invited to participate in the study (31/33) (Donnelly et al., Gynecol Oncol 122:618-624, 2011). Sixteen participants took part (16/31; physical activity (PA) group n\u2009=\u20099, contact control (CC) group n\u2009=\u20097). Four qualitative group interviews were conducted (focus group size 3-5). A structured interview guide was followed by an independent moderator. Groups were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using the framework approach (Ritchie and Spencer 2001), a five-stage qualitative method of analysis.","One of the most unanimously perceived benefits of taking part in the programme regarded participants' psychological well-being. Additional benefits included improved physical fitness and functioning. Important programme features included the weekly telephone calls from a physiotherapist, the patient-professional relationship, and goal setting. Participants' own motivation and programme timing were also identified as important factors. Suggestions for improvements include: opportunities for social interaction with other gynecological cancer survivors and greater exercise choice.",Findings suggest that women diagnosed with gynecological cancer perceive participation in physical activity as important and participation provides benefits in terms of psychological well-being and improved physical functioning. Support for continuation of many of the current features of the home-based programme was provided. Findings provide insight and rationale for the selection of components for future home-based physical activity interventions. Findings also support further research into the development of multidimensional interventions for the gynecological cancer population.
129,16094059,"Men with prostate cancer are often advised to make changes in diet and lifestyle, although the impact of these changes has not been well documented. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of comprehensive lifestyle changes on prostate specific antigen (PSA), treatment trends and serum stimulated LNCaP cell growth in men with early, biopsy proven prostate cancer after 1 year.","Patient recruitment was limited to men who had chosen not to undergo any conventional treatment, which provided an unusual opportunity to have a nonintervention randomized control group to avoid the confounding effects of interventions such as radiation, surgery or androgen deprivation therapy. A total of 93 volunteers with serum PSA 4 to 10 ng/ml and cancer Gleason scores less than 7 were randomly assigned to an experimental group that was asked to make comprehensive lifestyle changes or to a usual care control group.","None of the experimental group patients but 6 control patients underwent conventional treatment due to an increase in PSA and/or progression of disease on magnetic resonance imaging. PSA decreased 4% in the experimental group but increased 6% in the control group (p = 0.016). The growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia) was inhibited almost 8 times more by serum from the experimental than from the control group (70% vs 9%, p &lt;0.001). Changes in serum PSA and also in LNCaP cell growth were significantly associated with the degree of change in diet and lifestyle.","Intensive lifestyle changes may affect the progression of early, low grade prostate cancer in men. Further studies and longer term followup are warranted."
130,16810138,"In this study we investigated the effects of a clinical nursing symptom control intervention on utilization of physician, hospital and emergency room services.","Two hundred twenty-two patients currently undergoing chemotherapy were recruited for the study, and were randomized into either the 10-contact, 20-week experimental intervention group (110), where the intervention focused on assisting the patient in managing their symptoms, or to a conventional care control group (112).",A random effects regression model revealed that patients in the intervention group reported fewer emergency room visits than patients in the control group (p=0.050). Greater symptom severity and more comorbid conditions were also predictive of more emergency room visits. The intervention was effective in reducing the number of hospital visits for the subgroup of patients who at baseline reported above average symptom severity (p=0.023).,"These findings suggest that a nursing intervention focusing on educating patients regarding specific strategies to be applied for controlling symptoms may be worthwhile, as the patients may regain some control in managing their symptoms and thus ultimately require fewer emergency room services and hospital visits. Such a straightforward approach may empower patients, enhance their quality of life and reduce overall costs of cancer care."
131,29304140,"evaluate whether manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) or active exercise (AE) is associated with shoulder range of motion (ROM), wound complication and changes in the lymphatic parameters after breast cancer (BC) surgery and whether these parameters have an association with lymphedema formation in the long run.","Clinical trial with 106 women undergoing radical BC surgery, in the Women's Integrated Healthcare Center-University of Campinas. Women were matched for staging, age and body mass index and were allocated to performed AE or MLD, 2 weekly sessions during one month after surgery. The wound was evaluated 2 months after surgery. ROM, upper limb circumference measurement and upper limb lymphoscintigraphy were performed before surgery, and 2 and 30 months after surgery.","The incidence of seroma, dehiscence and infection did not differ between groups. Both groups showed ROM deficit of flexion and abduction in the second month postoperative and partial recovery after 30 months. Cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 23.8% and did not differ between groups (p = 0.29). Concerning the lymphoscintigraphy parameters, there was a significant convergent trend between baseline degree uptake (p = 0.003) and velocity visualization of axillary lymph nodes (p = 0.001) with lymphedema formation. A reduced marker uptake before or after surgery predicted lymphedema formation in the long run (&gt;2 years). None of the lymphoscintigraphy parameters were shown to be associated with the study group. Age \u226439 years was the factor with the greatest association with lymphedema (p = 0.009). In women with age \u226439 years, BMI &gt;24Kg/m2 was significantly associated with lymphedema (p = 0.017). In women over 39 years old, women treated with MLD were at a significantly higher risk of developing lymphedema (p = 0.011).","Lymphatic abnormalities precede lymphedema formation in BC patients. In younger women, obesity seems to be the major player in lymphedema development and, in older women, improving muscle strength through AE can prevent lymphedema. In essence, MLD is as safe and effective as AE in rehabilitation after breast cancer surgery."
132,26614591,To explore the effects of non-sporting qigong (NSQG) and sporting qigong (SQG) on frailty and quality of life (QOL) of breast cancer patients during chemotherapy.,"A time series (three-group, pre-test-post-test) quasi-experimental design was applied in the study. Ninety-five participants were assigned to three groups: controls (n = 31), NSQG (n = 33), or SQG (n = 31). All patients performed the qigong interventions three times per week for at least 30 min per session. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews before chemotherapy and at 1 and 3 months after chemotherapy. Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale. The Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form 36-Taiwanese version was used to evaluate the physical and mental component scores of QOL.","In the 1st and 3rd months after practicing qigong, patients in the SQG group had lower frailty scores than those in the control group. In the 3rd month after the intervention, patients in the NSQG group also had lower frailty scores and higher mental component scores for QOL than those in the control group. Patients with higher frailty scores had worse physical and mental component scores for QOL than those with lower frailty scores. The Sobel test showed that the frailty score mediated SQG and physical component scores for QOL.","SQG and NSQG appeared to be beneficial for improving frailty and QOL among the breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in the study. The results are preliminary and larger, well-constructed clinical studies are needed to verify the findings."
133,29181804,Strategies to improve pre-operative cardiopulmonary fitness could positively impact recovery after surgery. This study investigated the feasibility of vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise in bladder cancer patients prior to radical cystectomy (RC).,A total of 60 patients were randomised (1:1) to exercise or control following a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The exercise group was offered twice-weekly pre-operative supervised vigorous intensity aerobic interval exercise in addition to standard treatment. The controls received standard treatment only. A repeat CPET was undertaken before surgery and post-operative recovery outcomes were recorded.,"Over half of the 112 eligible patients approached in the clinic were recruited to the study (53.5%), with recruited patients attending a median of 8 (range 1-10) exercise sessions over a pre-operative period of 3-6\u00a0weeks. Improvements in peak values of oxygen pulse (P\u2009=\u20090.001), minute ventilation (P\u2009=\u20090.002) and power output (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) were observed at the follow-up CPET in the exercise group versus controls and there were no adverse events. Although this feasibility study was not powered to detect changes in post-operative recovery outcomes, there were marginal (non-significant) differences in favour of the exercise group in post-operative Clavien-Dindo score and need for high dependency unit inotropic support.","Bladder cancer patients respond well to pre-surgical aerobic interval exercise, and the improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness variables could have important implications for post-operative recuperation after RC. These findings provide a strong foundation for an adequately powered randomised controlled trial."
134,16289498,Acute gastrointestinal upset occurs in approximately 80% of patients undergoing radiotherapy for pelvic cancers. Underlying changes relate to denudation of the mucosal layer which renders the small intestine vulnerable to additional damage from proteolytic enzymes and bile acids. Severe acute bowel symptoms may predispose to progressive fibrotic and ischaemic changes. Elemental diet given during treatment may reduce acute and chronic bowel symptoms induced by pelvic radiotherapy.,"This study aimed to assess compliance with elemental diet during pelvic radiotherapy. Patients with gynaecological, urological or rectal malignancy undergoing radical or adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy were randomised to one of five groups. Each group was assigned a target quantity of three different elemental sip feeds (Group 1, 20%, Group 2, 50%, Group 3, 75% of calorie requirements taken as E028 extra liquid; Group 4, 50% of calorie requirements taken as E028 extra powder; Group 5, 50% of calorie requirements taken as Emsogen powder). Compliance was assessed using a diary card and weekly assessment. Statistical analyses were conducted on an intention to treat basis.","Fifty patients (44 female, six male) mean age 58 yr (95% CI 55-61), were recruited to the study (24 endometrial, 17 cervical, 7 rectal, 1 vulval and 1 bladder carcinoma). Mean weight at baseline was 74.5 kg (95% CI 69-80) and this did not change during treatment. Full compliance was achieved in three patients, all from Group 1. By week 5, only 46% of patients were consuming elemental diet. Post hoc analysis of variance with repeated measures indicated that there were no significant differences in volume of elemental diet consumed between groups (P = 0.937). There was a significant inverse linear relationship between intake of elemental diet and time (P &lt; 0.001).",Different formulations of elemental diet do not influence compliance. Patients are unlikely to be able to consume more than one-third of their calorie requirements in the form of an elemental sip feed. Further investigation is warranted to determine if intervention with this volume of elemental diet is beneficial.
135,19563193,To observe clinical therapeutic effects of acupuncture combined with medication in restoration of gastrointestinal functions for postoperative patients with gastric cancer.,"Ninety patients undergoing radical surgeries for gastric cancer were randomly, according to the sequence of their operations, divided into three groups: a control group treated conventionally after their surgeries (group CONT, 30 cases), a Chinese medicine group treated by Simo Decoction administered by way of a nutrient canal in addition to the conventional treatment (group CM, 30 cases), and an acupuncture plus Chinese medicine group treated by warming needling in addition to those given in the Chinese medicine group (group ACUP+CM, 30 cases). Therapeutic effects were estimated 10 days after their operations.","The time for restoration of gastrointestinal functions was obviously shortened, and the problems of poor appetite and difficulty in defecation were more markedly improved in group ACUP+CM than those in both group CONT and group CM (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05). Ten days after operations, the number of patients with normal lymphocytes and normal percentage rate of lymphocytes to neutrophile granulocytes was obviously more in group ACUP+CM than those in both group CONT and group CM (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05).","Acupuncture combined with Chinese medicine is favorable in accelerating early air exhaustion and defecation, improving clinical symptoms, as well as in bi-directional regulating peripheral white blood cells."
136,16642619,To study on regulative action of scalp acupuncture on oxidative stress reaction at operation stage.,"Fifty two cases selected for radical operation of intestinal cancer were randomly divided into a scalp acupuncture plus general anesthesia (scalp acupuncture group) and a simple general anesthesia group (general anesthesia group), 26 cases in each group. The scalp acupuncture group were treated first with scalp acupuncture for 20 min, followed by general anesthesia, with scalp acupuncture lasted till the end of operation. The general anesthesia group were treated only with simple intratracheal anesthesia. Effects of scalp acupuncture on malondialdehyde (MDA) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity at the operation stage were observed.","After operation, MDA levels decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in the two groups, but with no difference between the two groups in the different values of MDA before and after treatment (P &gt; 0.05); there was no significant change in SOD before and after treatment in the scalp acupuncture group, and significantly decreased in the general anesthesia group (P &lt; 0.05). There was a significant difference between the two groups in the different value of SOD before and after the operation (P &lt; 0.05).","Scalp acupuncture can inhibit the decrease of SOD activity, reducing oxidative stress reaction at operation stage."
137,11073017,Some epidemiological studies have suggested that high dietary intake of calcium and fibre reduces colorectal carcinogenesis. Available data are not sufficient to serve as a basis for firm dietary advice. We undertook a multicentre randomised trial to test the effect of diet supplementation with calcium and fibre on adenoma recurrence.,"We randomly assigned 665 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas to three treatment groups, in a parallel design: calcium gluconolactate and carbonate (2 g elemental calcium daily), fibre (3.5 g ispaghula husk), or placebo. Participants had colonoscopy after 3 years of follow-up. The primary endpoint was adenoma recurrence. Analyses were by intention to treat.","23 patients died, 15 were lost to follow-up, 45 refused repeat colonoscopy, and five developed severe contraindications to colonoscopy. Among the 552 participants who completed the follow-up examination, 94 stopped treatment early. At least one adenoma developed in 28 (15.9%) of 176 patients in the calcium group, 58 (29.3%) of 198 in the fibre group, and 36 (20.2%) of 178 in the placebo group. The adjusted odds ratio for recurrence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.38-1.17; p=0.16) for calcium treatment and 1.67 (1.01-2.76, p=0.042) for the fibre treatment. The odds ratio associated with the fibre treatment was significantly higher in participants with baseline dietary calcium intake above the median than in those with intake below the median (interaction test, p=0.028)","Supplementation with fibre as ispaghula husk may have adverse effects on colorectal adenoma recurrence, especially in patients with high dietary calcium intake. Calcium supplementation was associated with a modest but not significant reduction in the risk of adenoma recurrence."
138,17521871,"This study investigated the ongoing effects of participation in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on quality of life (QL), symptoms of stress, mood and endocrine, immune and autonomic parameters in early stage breast and prostate cancer patients.","Forty-nine patients with breast cancer and 10 with prostate cancer enrolled in an eight-week MBSR program that incorporated relaxation, meditation, gentle yoga and daily home practice. Demographic and health behaviors, QL, mood, stress symptoms, salivary cortisol levels, immune cell counts, intracellular cytokine production, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up.","Fifty-nine, 51, 47 and 41 patients were assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively, although not all participants provided data on all outcomes at each time point. Linear mixed modeling showed significant improvements in overall symptoms of stress which were maintained over the follow-up period. Cortisol levels decreased systematically over the course of the follow-up. Immune patterns over the year supported a continued reduction in Th1 (pro-inflammatory) cytokines. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from pre- to post-intervention and HR was positively associated with self-reported symptoms of stress.","MBSR program participation was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms, altered cortisol and immune patterns consistent with less stress and mood disturbance, and decreased blood pressure. These pilot data represent a preliminary investigation of the longer-term relationships between MBSR program participation and a range of potentially important biomarkers."
139,17728216,"Breast cancer surgery is associated with side effects, including postsurgical pain, nausea, and fatigue. We carried out a randomized clinical trial to test the hypotheses that a brief presurgery hypnosis intervention would decrease intraoperative anesthesia and analgesic use and side effects associated with breast cancer surgery and that it would be cost effective.","We randomly assigned 200 patients who were scheduled to undergo excisional breast biopsy or lumpectomy (mean age 48.5 years) to a 15-minute presurgery hypnosis session conducted by a psychologist or nondirective empathic listening (attention control). Patients were not blinded to group assignment. Intraoperative anesthesia use (i.e., of the analgesics lidocaine and fentanyl and the sedatives propofol and midazolam) was assessed. Patient-reported pain and other side effects as measured on a visual analog scale (0-100) were assessed at discharge, as was use of analgesics in the recovery room. Institutional costs and time in the operating room were assessed via chart review.","Patients in the hypnosis group required less propofol (means = 64.01 versus 96.64 microg; difference = 32.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.95 to 61.30) and lidocaine (means = 24.23 versus 31.09 mL; difference = 6.86; 95% CI = 3.05 to 10.68) than patients in the control group. Patients in the hypnosis group also reported less pain intensity (means = 22.43 versus 47.83; difference = 25.40; 95% CI = 17.56 to 33.25), pain unpleasantness (means = 21.19 versus 39.05; difference = 17.86; 95% CI = 9.92 to 25.80), nausea (means = 6.57 versus 25.49; difference = 18.92; 95% CI = 12.98 to 24.87), fatigue (means = 29.47 versus 54.20; difference = 24.73; 95% CI = 16.64 to 32.83), discomfort (means = 23.01 versus 43.20; difference = 20.19; 95% CI = 12.36 to 28.02), and emotional upset (means = 8.67 versus 33.46; difference = 24.79; 95% CI = 18.56 to 31.03). No statistically significant differences were seen in the use of fentanyl, midazolam, or recovery room analgesics. Institutional costs for surgical breast cancer procedures were $8561 per patient at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Patients in the hypnosis group cost the institution $772.71 less per patient than those in the control group (95% CI = 75.10 to 1469.89), mainly due to reduced surgical time.","Hypnosis was superior to attention control regarding propofol and lidocaine use; pain, nausea, fatigue, discomfort, and emotional upset at discharge; and institutional cost. Overall, the present data support the use of hypnosis with breast cancer surgery patients."
140,25243960,To evaluate the efficacy of Fuzhenghuayu capsule for the prevention of oesophageal variceal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis.,"A multicentre randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted. A total of 181 liver cirrhosis patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to different groups according to the level of oesophageal variceal bleeding. Patients with light oesophageal varices received Fuzhenghuayu capsule or a placebo. Patients with medium to heavy oesophageal varices received either Fuzhenghuayu capsule alone, Fuzhenghuayu capsule plus propranolol, or propranolol plus a placebo. Patients with a history of oesophageal variceal bleeding received either Fuzhenghuayu capsule plus propranolol, propranolol alone, or a placebo. For all patients, the treatment lasted 2 years. The primary end point of the study was oesophageal variceal bleeding. The secondary end points were liver cancer, death by any cause, and liver transplantation. Risk of bleeding and survival were statistically assessed.","The median follow-up time was 50 months. The patients with small oesophageal varices who were treated with Fuzhenghuayu capsule showed a significantly higher cumulative probability of bleeding than their counterparts treated with the placebo (3.4% vs. 23.7%, x\u00b2 = 4.829, P =0.028). The patients with medium to heavy oesophageal varices and no history of oesophageal variceal bleeding who were treated with Fuzhenghuayu capsule plus propranolol showed a remarkably higher cumulative probability of bleeding than their counterparts treated with propranolol alone (15.2% vs. 43.6%, x\u00b2 =6.166, P =0.013). There were no significant differences between the patients treated with Fuzhenghuayu capsule alone and those treated with propranolol alone (P =0.147) or the patients treated with Fuzhenghuayu capsule plus propranolol and those treated with Fuzhenghuayu capsule alone (P =0.147).

141,20494414,"To determine the effect of acupuncture on hot flash frequency and intensity, quality of life, and sleep quality in patients undergoing hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. Hot flashes are a common adverse effect of hormonal therapy for prostate cancer.","Men who had a hot flash score &gt; 4 who were receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer underwent acupuncture with electrostimulation biweekly for 4 weeks, then weekly for 6 weeks, using a predefined treatment plan. The primary endpoint was a 50% reduction in the hot flash score after 4 weeks of therapy, calculated from the patients' daily hot flash diaries. The hot flash-related quality of life and sleep quality and biomarkers potentially related to hot flashes, including serotonin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, were examined.","A total of 25 men were enrolled from September 2003 to April 2007. Of these, 22 were eligible and evaluable. After 4 weeks, 9 (41%, 95% confidence interval 21%-64%) of 22 patients had had a &gt; 50% reduction in the hot flash score. Of the 22 patients, 12 (55%, 95% confidence interval 32%-76%) met this response definition at any point during the therapy course. No patient had a significant increase in hot flash score during therapy. A reduced hot flash score was associated with improvement in the hot flash-related quality of life and sleep quality.","Multiple placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated a 25% response rate to placebo treatment for hot flashes. Of the 22 patients, 41% had responded by week 4 and 55% overall in the present pilot study, providing evidence of a potentially meaningful benefit. Additional studies of acupuncture for hot flashes in this population are warranted."
142,15313081,"Cancer screening in primary care offices is reaching only a modest percentage of adults 50 years and older. The objectives of this study were to determine if screening rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer could be significantly increased by two simple office interventions in community-based primary care offices and then maintained over 3 years.","Twenty-two community-based primary care practices were divided randomly into four arms: control, practice-based intervention, patient-based intervention, and both interventions combined. At baseline and annually for 3 years, medical records from approximately 100 male and 100 female patients 50 years and older were randomly selected. The outcome measures were screening rates for mammogram, Pap smear, fecal occult blood test, and flexible sigmoidoscopy or other colonic imaging.","Generally each study arm evidenced a significant 1-year increase in screening rates, followed by an overall decline to approximate baseline levels. The first year increases in screening were not related to either invention, alone or in combination.",These interventions do not have a significant impact on cancer screening rates in adults over several years. A variety of possible variables may have affected the long-term outcomes.
143,28094662,"Mindfulness-based intervention has been found efficacious in reducing persistent pain in women treated for breast cancer. Little, however, is known about possible moderators of the effect. We explored clinical and psychological moderators of the effect on pain intensity previously found in a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with women treated for breast cancer with persistent pain.","A total of 129 women treated for breast cancer reporting persistent pain were randomized to MBCT or a wait-list control. The primary outcome of pain intensity (11-point numeric rating scale) was measured at baseline, post-intervention, three, and six months follow-up. Proposed clinical moderators included age, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), radiotherapy, and endocrine treatment. Psychological moderators included psychological distress [the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], the adult attachment dimensions anxiety and avoidance [the Experiences in Close Relationships Short Form (the ECR-SF)], and alexithymia [the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)]. Multi-level models were used to test moderation effects over time, i.e. time\u2009\u00d7\u2009group\u2009\u00d7\u2009moderator.","Only attachment avoidance (p\u2009=\u20090.03, d\u2009=\u20090.36) emerged as a statistically significant moderator. Higher levels of attachment avoidance predicted a larger effect of MBCT in reducing pain intensity compared with lower levels attachment avoidance. None of the remaining psychological or clinical moderators reached statistical significance. However, based on the effect size, radiotherapy (p\u2009=\u20090.075, d\u2009=\u20090.49) was indicated as a possible clinical moderator of the effect, with radiotherapy being associated with a smaller effect of MBCT on pain intensity over time compared with no radiotherapy.","Attachment avoidance, and potentially radiotherapy, may be clinically relevant factors for identifying the patients who may benefit most from MBCT as a pain intervention. Due to the exploratory nature of the analyses, the results should be considered preliminary."

Adherence to the program averaged 68% \u00b1 4% and no major adverse events or health issues were noted. A significant interaction (group-time) effect was found for all five-repetition maximum tests (leg/bench press and lateral row; all P &lt; 0.001). Performance significantly increased after training (leg press: 40% [95% confidence interval [CI], 15-41 kg); bench press: 24% [95% CI, 6-14 kg]; lateral row 25% [95% CI, 6-15 kg]), whereas an opposite trend was found in controls. Two-month post values tended to be higher than baseline for leg (P = 0.017) and bench press (P = 0.014). In contrast, no significant interaction effect was found for any of the secondary endpoints.",An inhospital exercise program for pediatric cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing neoadjuvant treatment increases muscle strength despite the aggressiveness of such therapy.
145,30473256,Most art therapy research has involved patients with malignancies other than gynecologic cancer. The current study aimed to assess the impact of an art therapy intervention on the quality of life (QOL) in patients with gynecologic cancer who were receiving chemotherapy.,"This was a prospective, non-randomized, pilot study. Eligible patients had a primary or recurrent gynecologic malignancy scheduled to be treated with at least 6\u202fcycles of chemotherapy over 18\u202fweeks. The intervention consisted of five sessions of art therapy during the chemotherapy. Patients completed a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire prior to starting chemotherapy, and again at completion of the fifth session. Differences between the FACT-G scores were examined by paired t-tests. An increase in the mean FACT-G score indicated an improvement in QOL. At each session, the patients completed a separate, supplemental questionnaire to subjectively rate the benefit of the session and to express their experience with the art intervention.","Twenty-four patients enrolled. Eight did not complete the study, leaving 16 evaluable patients. The mean FACT-G score pre-chemotherapy was 82.3 (95% CI: 75.5, 89.2), and post-art therapy was 78.6 (95% CI: 71.7, 85.5). The mean change in QOL was -3.7 points (95% CI: -10.7, 3.2, p\u202f=\u202f0.270). A supplemental questionnaire indicated that 15 of 16 patients felt that art therapy was beneficial at each session.",FACT-G scores did not significantly change over the course of chemotherapy in patients with gynecologic cancers receiving art therapy. Several published studies have indicated that chemotherapy is associated with a decline in QOL. Our results suggest art therapy may help to prevent or mitigate this decline.

147,25449310,To compare the efficacy between acupuncture and ondansetron in the prevention of delayed chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).,"70 patients were randomized to receive either 1) acupuncture at P6 point before chemotherapy infusion or 2) ondansetron 8 mg intravenously 30 min before chemotherapy infusion in their first cycle with cross-over of antiemetic regimen in the consecutive cycle. All patients received dexamethasone 5mg orally twice a day for 3 days. Patients were given additional does of ondansetron 4 mg orally every 12h if they experienced emesis. Emetic episode, severity of nausea score of 0-10 and adverse events were recorded. Complete response was defined as no nausea, no vomiting and no requirement of additional antiemetic drugs. FACT-G scale was used to evaluate quality of life (QOL) 7 days after each cycle of chemotherapy.","The acupuncture group had a significantly higher rate of complete response in the prevention of delayed CINV (52.8% and 35.7%, P = 0.02). Compared to another group, the acupuncture group reported significantly lower delayed nausea (45.7% and 65.7%, P = 0.004), nausea score (P &lt; 0.001) and fewer dosages of additional oral ondansetron (P = 0.002). Adverse effects were also significantly lower in the acupuncture group with less frequent constipation (P = 0.02) and insomnia (P = 0.01). Overall FACT-G scores were significantly higher in the acupuncture group.","Acupuncture is effective in preventing delayed CINV and in promoting better QOL. With fewer adverse effects, it may be used as an alternative treatment option for CINV."

This study evaluated the health benefits of an expressive writing intervention among breast cancer patients in mainland China.,"Stage I-III Chinese breast cancer survivors undergoing chemotherapy were recruited in Shanghai, China. They (n\u2009=\u200990) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a positive thinking group (PTC) to write about the positive aspects of their cancer experience; a self-regulation condition (SRC) to write about their stress and coping efforts, deepest feelings, and positive aspects of their cancer experience; or a cancer-fact group (CFC) to write about facts relevant to their cancer experience. All groups wrote for 30\u00a0min every week for 4\u00a0weeks. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the FACT-B at baseline and 1- and 2-month follow-ups. Linear mixed effects models were used to test the hypotheses that the SRC and PTC would improve QOL compared to the CFC.","QOL improved overtime in the whole sample. Contrary to hypotheses, the CFC had increased QOL compared with the SRC from baseline to both the 1- and 2-month follow-ups (\u0394QOL\u2009=\u20099.31, p\u2009=\u20090.01, d\u2009=\u20090.44; \u0394QOL\u2009=\u20099.45, p\u2009=\u20090.025, d\u2009=\u20090.49). The PTC did not differ from cancer-fact writing but had increased QOL compared with the SRC from baseline to both the 1- and 2-month follow-ups (\u0394QOL\u2009=\u20097.44, p\u2009=\u20090.04, d\u2009=\u20090.35; \u0394QOL\u2009=\u200911.72, p\u2009=\u20090.06, d\u2009=\u20090.61).",Interventions through expressive writing about positive experience and cancer facts are feasible and can benefit Chinese cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
150,20353106,To study the effect of acupuncture on the immune function of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis.,"Sixty cases with colorectal cancer liver metastasis confirmed by pathology and mageology diagnosis were treated with acupuncture. Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Neiguan (PC 6), Shangjuxu (ST 37), Hegu (LI 4), Taixi (KI 3), Taichong (LR 3) ,Yinlingquan (SP 9), Yanglingquan (GB 34), etc. were selected for acupuncture, and Shenque (CV 8), Guanyuan (CV 4), Qihai (CV 6), Zusanli (ST 36) were selected for moxibustion. The changes of CD(3) , CD(4) , CD(8) T cells and NK cells in value were examined with flow cytometry before and after treatment.","The value of T lymphocyte subsets such as CD(3) , CD(4), and CD(8) , as well as NK cells were obviously increased after treatment, and there were significant differences between them before and after treatment.",Acupuncture can improve the immune function of patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis.
151,28618158,"Physical activity (PA) may be important for preventing chronic diseases for adolescent and young adult (AYA) childhood cancer survivors. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of PA interventions for AYA survivors are sparse, but necessary to determine effective programs for increasing PA among this population. Thus, we conducted a pilot RCT, testing the feasibility of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention to promote PA among AYA survivors.","We recruited 14- to 18-year-olds who were \u22651-year post cancer therapy from Seattle Children's Hospital. The 10-week intervention consisted of a wearable PA-tracking device (Fitbit Flex) and a peer-based virtual support group (Facebook group). Research staff helped set step goals and awarded badges weekly. Controls received usual care. Baseline assessments occurred before randomization and follow-up assessments occurred during weeks 8-10 of the intervention period. Feasibility criteria are defined below. Qualitative interviews assessed acceptability. Exploratory outcomes included PA, quality of life, and motivation for PA.","All feasibility criteria were met: we recruited 60 survivors, intervention participants wore the Fitbit on the majority (71.5%) of intervention days, and \u226590% of all participants completed questionnaires. Qualitative data confirmed intervention acceptability. Exploratory analyses found no significant adjusted group differences for change in moderate-to-vigorous PA (4.4 vs. 5.0 min/day; P = 0.92) or sedentary time (-4.5 vs. 1.0 min/day; P = 0.73), comparing intervention subjects to controls. Some modest differences were found for select subscales of quality of life and motivation for PA.",This mHealth PA intervention was feasible and acceptable to AYA childhood cancer survivors and warrants a fully powered RCT.
152,11440068,Morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) are heightened among the socioeconomically disadvantaged.,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a videotaped intervention using peer educators as well as a health professional to increase compliance with fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening. Participants were 160 older individuals attending a medical outpatient clinic. Compliance with FOBT use was the dependent measure. Demographic variables, family history of CRC, viewing the videotape, perceived risk, self-efficacy, physician recommendation, knowledge about CRC screening, and intent to use the FOBT were independent measures.","Approximately 41% of participants complied with FOBT screening. Significant relationships were found between intent and family history of CRC, viewing the video, perceived risk, self-efficacy, and CRC knowledge. However, none of these variables was significantly related to compliance with FOBT use.","Although modest compliance rates were shown for both experimental and control groups, their compliance did not differ significantly. Further investigation of the impact of a video as part of an enhanced intervention program should be considered."
153,17459064,This study aimed to assess the utility of a standardised risk information tool with respect to the uptake of screening activities administered to an accessible population of first-degree relatives of patients with sporadic colorectal cancer.,"Patients admitted for colorectal cancer resection were invited to enroll their family unit in the study. Families were randomised either to receive standard care or the intervention tool. The intervention group received a structured one page pamphlet outlining the risk associated with a family history of colorectal cancer, and the availability of and potential benefits from screening. Three months after the initial contact with the index patient, family members were invited to participate in a telephone interview. Primary end-points were both intention to screen and uptake of screening activities.","Forty-seven families had 156 eligible first degree relatives. Ninety-one consented to participate and were enrolled: 59 received standard care, 32 received the intervention. Age and sex were similar between groups. There was no significant difference in previous screening activities. The intervention tool had no influence on perceived self-risk of developing colorectal cancer or uptake of screening activities within the study period.",This study suggests that the provision of targeted risk information to first-degree relatives is not likely to positively influence screening behaviour. Health care providers need to find alternative methods of disseminating information to this high-risk group.
154,15986401,"Treatments for clinically localized prostate carcinoma are accompanied by sexual, urinary, and bowel dysfunction and other sequelae that can result in significant distress and reduced well being. Methods capable of improving quality of life are needed that can be integrated into clinical practice. To address this need, a nurse-driven, cancer care intervention was developed and tested.","Within 6 weeks after completing treatment, 99 patients, along with their partners, were enrolled into a prospective, controlled trial and were randomized to receive the cancer care intervention or to receive standard care. Participants in the intervention arm met once each month for 6 months with an oncology nurse intervenor, who helped patients identify their quality-of-life needs using an interactive computer program. The intervener then provided education and support tailored to participants' needs. Primary outcome variables included 1) disease-specific quality of life, including sexual, urinary, and bowel outcomes and cancer worry; 2) depression; 3) dyadic adjustment; and 4) general quality of life. Outcomes data were collected prior to randomization and again at 4 months, 7 months, and 12 months posttreatment.",Patients in the intervention arm experienced long-term improvements in quality-of-life outcomes related to sexual functioning and cancer worry compared with patients who received standard care. Baseline depression moderated the impact of the intervention on several other quality-of-life outcomes.,"The findings of the current study indicated that a computer-assisted, nurse-driven intervention was capable of providing durable improvements in the quality of life of men who underwent treatment for clinically localized prostate carcinoma."
155,24811759,The purpose of this parallel randomised controlled trial was to compare compliance with different modalities used to invite patients with a positive immunochemical faecal occult blood test (FIT+) for a total colonoscopy (TC).,"FIT+ patients from nine Italian colorectal cancer screening programmes were randomised to be invited for a TC initially by mail or by phone and, for non-compliers, to be recalled by mail, for counselling with a general practitioner, or to meet with a specialist screening practitioner (nurse or healthcare assistant).","In all, 3777 patients were randomised to different invitation strategies. Compliance with an initial invitation by mail and by phone was similar (86.0% vs. 84.0%, relative risk - RR: 1.02; 95%CI 0.97-1.08). Among non-responders to the initial invitation, compliance with a recall by appointment with a specialist practitioner was 50.4%, significantly higher than with a mail recall (38.1%; RR:1.33; 95%CI 1.01-1.76) or with a face-to-face counselling with the GP (30.8%; RR:1.45;95%CI 1.14-1.87).","Compliance with an initial invitation for a TC by mail and by phone was similar. A personal meeting with a specialist screening practitioner was associated with the highest compliance among non-compliers with initial invitations, while the involvement of GPs in this particular activity seemed less effective."
156,26403252,"This study examined cancer knowledge in adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors and pilot tested a Web-based resource to provide individually tailored information regarding cancer treatment history, late effects risk, and resources.","Fifty-two survivors (15-28\u00a0years old) who completed cancer treatment were recruited from the University of Minnesota oncology clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to receive access to personalized health history, late effects information, and resources via a password-protected Web portal or to standard of care (physician counseling) only. Participants completed surveys measuring cancer knowledge, health locus of control, and psychosocial well-being prior to randomization and approximately 1\u00a0year later.","Overall, few participants accurately reported their chemotherapy history with detail (19% at baseline and 33% at follow-up), and many did not recognize that previous cancer treatments could impact future health (60% at baseline and 54% at follow-up). Among those randomized to the receive access to the website, utilization was very low, making it difficult to draw conclusions about efficacy. Nonetheless, these data suggest that offering tailored information through the Web was not more effective than standard of care at improving cancer knowledge. Anxiety and health beliefs were associated with cancer knowledge, including knowledge of steps survivors could take to mitigate late effects risks (p\u2009&lt;\u200901).","Knowledge gaps exist among AYA survivors regarding important aspects of their treatment histories and ongoing health risks.

157,17823909,Obesity is considered a risk factor for the development of breast cancer-related lymphedema of the arm and as a poor prognostic factor in response to lymphedema treatment. The objective of this study was to examine weight reduction as a treatment for breast cancer-related lymphedema.,Twenty-one women with breast cancer-related lymphedema were randomized either to receive dietary advice for weight reduction or to receive a booklet on general healthy eating. They were monitored for 12 weeks.,The primary outcome measure was arm volume at 12 weeks. The results indicated a significant reduction in swollen arm volume at the end of the 12-week period (P = .003) in the intervention weight-reduction group. There was a significant reduction in body weight (P = .02) and body mass index (P = .016) in the weight-reduction group at the end of the 12-week study period.,Weight loss achieved by dietary advice to reduce energy intake can reduce breast cancer-related lymphedema significantly.
158,22689129,"Pomegranate juice has been associated with PSA doubling time (PSADT) elongation in a single-arm phase II trial. This study assesses biological activity of two doses of pomegranate extract (POMx) in men with recurrent prostate cancer, using changes in PSADT as the primary outcome.","This randomized, multi-center, double-blind phase II, dose-exploring trial randomized men with a rising PSA and without metastases to receive 1 or 3 g of POMx, stratified by baseline PSADT and Gleason score. Patients (104) were enrolled and treated for up to 18 months. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was 96% white, with median age 74.5 years and median Gleason score 7. This study was designed to detect a 6-month on-study increase in PSADT from baseline in each arm.","Overall, median PSADT in the ITT population lengthened from 11.9 months at baseline to 18.5 months after treatment (P &lt; 0.001). PSADT lengthened in the low-dose group from 11.9 to 18.8 months and 12.2 to 17.5 months in the high-dose group, with no significant difference between dose groups (P = 0.554). PSADT increases &gt;100% of baseline were observed in 43% of patients. Declining PSA levels were observed in 13 patients (13%). In all, 42% of patients discontinued treatment before meeting the protocol-definition of PSA progression, or 18 months, primarily due to a rising PSA. No significant changes occurred in testosterone. Although no clinically significant toxicities were seen, diarrhea was seen in 1.9% and 13.5% of patients in the 1- and 3-g dose groups, respectively.","POMx treatment was associated with \u2265 6 month increases in PSADT in both treatment arms without adverse effects. The significance of this on-study slowing of PSADT remains unclear, reinforcing the need for placebo-controlled studies in this patient population."
159,21136031,To evaluate the therapeutic effect of rehabilitation therapy on radiation-induced dysphagia and trismus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after radiotherapy.,"43 NPC patients after radiotherapy were included. Patients were randomly assigned to either the rehabilitation group or a control group. Both groups were subjected to routine treatment, while the rehabilitation group also received rehabilitation therapy for 3 months. The severity of dysphagia was assessed using the water swallow test, while trismus was evaluated with the LENT/SOMA score and the interincisor distance (IID). The water swallow test, the LENT/SOMA score, as well as IID for both groups before and after treatment were analyzed and compared.","After treatment, the rehabilitation group displayed a significant improvement in swallowing function, while the control group did not. The efficacy rate (percentage of patients with excellent or effective results) of rehabilitation group was higher than that of control group (77% vs. 43%), and the difference was statistically significant (\u03f0(2) = 5.32, p = 0.02). IID pretreatment and posttreatment did not show much difference in the rehabilitation group, while in the control group IID significantly decreased posttreatment (1.1 \u00b1 0.36 cm vs.1.8 \u00b1 0.56 cm, p = 0.001). Although the mean IID in patients of both groups decreased after the 3 month follow-up, the decrease in the rehabilitation group was less than that of the control group (0.19 \u00b1 0.5 cm vs. 0.69 \u00b1 0.56 cm, p = 0.004 ). The efficacy rate of trismus in the rehabilitation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (64% vs. 28%, \u03f0(2) = 5.31, p = 0.02).",Rehabilitation training can improve swallow function and slow down the progress of trismus in NPC patients following radiotherapy.
160,15117996,To determine whether improvement in postchemotherapy fatigue following acupuncture treatment is substantial enough to warrant a controlled trial.,"We accrued patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who had completed cytotoxic chemotherapy but experienced persisting fatigue. Patients with severe anemia, clinical depression, or Karnofsky performance status score less than 70 were excluded. Thirty-seven patients were registered in two cohorts; 31 provided follow-up data. Patients received acupuncture either twice per week for 4 weeks (25 patients) or once per week for 6 weeks (12 patients). The primary end point was change in score on the Brief Fatigue Inventory between baseline and 2 weeks after the final treatment. A baseline Brief Fatigue Inventory score of four or greater was an eligibility requirement for the trial.","Patients had completed cytotoxic chemotherapy an average of more than 2 years previously. Baseline fatigue scores were high, with approximately half of the sample scoring in the &quot;severe&quot; range. Mean improvement following acupuncture was 31.1% (95% CI, 20.6% to 41.5%), meeting our prespecified criterion for declaring acupuncture worthy of further study. Increasing age was associated with poorer response and failure to complete the study. There was no important difference in improvement following once-weekly and twice-weekly treatments.",Acupuncture is worthy of further study in the treatment of postchemotherapy fatigue.
161,16889324,"Women with breast cancer suffer from considerable stress related to the diagnosis, surgery, and medical treatment. It is important to develop strategies to strengthen coping resources among these women. Research in art therapy has shown outcomes such as an increase in self-esteem and cohesion, significant improvement in global health, and a decrease in anxiety and depression. The aim of the present article was to describe the effects of an art therapy intervention program on coping resources in women with primary breast cancer.","In this article, we report some of the results from a study including 41 women, aged 37-69 years old, with nonmetastatic primary breast cancer, referred to the Department of Oncology at Ume\u00e5 University Hospital in Sweden for postoperative radiotherapy. The women represented various socioeconomic backgrounds. They were randomized to a study group (n = 20) with individual art therapy for 1 h/week during postoperative radiotherapy or to a control group (n = 21). The article focuses on changes in coping resources, as measured by the Coping Resources Inventory (CRI) before and 2 and 6 months after the start of radiotherapy. The study protocol was approved by the Ume\u00e5 University Ethical Committee at the Medical Faculty (archive number 99-386).",There was an overall increase in coping resources among women with breast cancer after taking part in the art therapy intervention. Significant differences were seen between the study and control groups in the social domain on the second and third occasions. Significant differences were also observed in the total score on the second occasion.,"This study shows that individual art therapy provided by a trained art therapist in a clinical setting can give beneficial support to women with primary breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy, as it can improve their coping resources."
162,22699884,"To perform a process evaluation of a hospital-based work support intervention for cancer patients aimed at enhancing return to work and quality of life. The intervention involves the delivery of patient education and support at the hospital and involves the improvement of the communication between the treating physician and the occupational physician. In addition, the research team asked patient's occupational physician to organise a meeting with the patient and the supervisor to make a concrete gradual return-to-work plan.","Eligible were cancer patients treated with curative intent and who have paid work. Data were collected from patients assigned to the intervention group (N = 65) and from nurses who delivered the patient education and support at the hospital (N = 4) by means of questionnaires, nurses' reports, and checklists. Data were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed.","A total of 47 % of all eligible patients participated. Nurses delivered the patient education and support in 85 % of the cases according to the protocol. In 100 % of the cases at least one letter was sent to the occupational physician. In 10 % of the cases the meeting with the patient, the occupational physician and the supervisor took place. Patients found the intervention in general very useful and nurses found the intervention feasible to deliver.",We found that a hospital- based work support intervention was easily accepted in usual psycho-oncological care but that it proved difficult to involve the occupational physician. Patients were highly satisfied and nurses found the intervention feasible.
163,17582616,"Cancer treatments have serious physiological and psychological side effects in cancer survivors. This investigation examined cardiopulmonary function and fatigue in breast cancer survivors during and after treatment by using similar exercise assessments, prescriptions, individualized interventions, and reassessments.","The study included 113 women diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants were grouped according to whether they participated in an individualized prescriptive exercise program during cancer treatment (DTm) or after cancer treatment (FTm). After a comprehensive screening and medical examination, cardiovascular endurance, pulmonary function, and fatigue were assessed, which led to the development of an individualized 6-month exercise prescription and exercise intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare the effectiveness of the intervention and differences between groups.","Cardiopulmonary function (systolic blood pressure, time on treadmill) improved in the DTm group (P &lt; .05), whereas the FTm group showed reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate (P &lt; .05) with concurrent increases in percentage of predicted FVC, % of predicted FEV(1), predicted VO(2)max, and time on treadmill (P &lt; .05). Psychologically, the DTm group showed reductions in behavioral, sensory, and total fatigue (P &lt; .05), whereas the FTm group showed reductions in behavioral, affective, sensory, cognitive/mood, and total fatigue (P &lt; .05).","The current study suggested that moderate intensity, individualized, prescriptive exercise maintains or improves cardiovascular and pulmonary function with concomitant reductions in fatigue during and after cancer treatment. However, it is critical that exercise be individualized to specific needs of the cancer survivor to prevent exacerbation of cancer treatment toxicities."
164,16702582,"Lymphedema is a common condition that breast cancer survivors face. Despite a lack of supporting evidence from prospective observational studies, occupational and leisure time physical activity are feared to be possible risk factors for lymphedema onset or exacerbation. We examined effects of supervised upper- and lower-body weight training on the incidence and symptoms of lymphedema in 45 breast cancer survivors who participated in the Weight Training for Breast Cancer Survivors study.","Participants were on average 52 years old, 4 to 36 months post-treatment, and had axillary dissection as part of their treatment. Thirteen women had prevalent lymphedema at baseline. The intervention was twice-a-week weight training over a period of 6 months. Lymphedema was monitored at baseline and 6 months by measuring the circumference of each arm, and by self-report of symptoms and clinical diagnosis.","None of the intervention-group participants experienced a change in arm circumferences &gt; or = 2.0 cm after a 6-month exercise intervention. Self-reported incidence of a clinical diagnosis of lymphedema or symptom changes over 6 months did not vary by intervention status (P = .40 and P = .22, respectively).",This is the largest randomized controlled trial to examine associations between exercise and lymphedema in breast cancer survivors. The results of this study support the hypotheses that a 6-month intervention of resistance exercise did not increase the risk for or exacerbate symptoms of lymphedema. These results herald the need to start reevaluating common clinical guidelines that breast cancer survivors avoid upper body resistance activity for fear of increasing risk of lymphedema.
165,8008027,"People who consume a diet high in vegetables and fruits have a lower risk of cancer of the large bowel. Antioxidant vitamins, which are present in vegetables and fruits, have been associated with a diminished risk of cancers at various anatomical sites. We conducted a randomized, controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy of beta carotene and vitamins C and E in preventing colorectal adenoma, a precursor of invasive cancer.","We randomly assigned 864 patients, using a two-by-two factorial design, to four treatment groups, which received placebo; beta carotene (25 mg daily); vitamin C (1 g daily) and vitamin E (400 mg daily); or the beta carotene plus vitamins C and E. In order to identify new adenomas, we performed complete colonoscopic examinations in the patients one year and four years after they entered the study. The primary end points for analyses were new adenomas identified after the first of these two follow-up examinations.","Patients adhered well to the prescribed regimen, and 751 completed the four-year clinical trial. There was no evidence that either beta carotene or vitamins C and E reduced the incidence of adenomas; the relative risk for beta carotene was 1.01 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.20); for vitamins C and E, it was 1.08 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.29). Neither treatment appeared to be effective in any subgroup of patients or in the prevention of any subtype of polyp defined by size or location.","The lack of efficacy of these vitamins argues against the use of supplemental beta carotene and vitamins C and E to prevent colorectal cancer. Although our data do not prove definitively that these antioxidants have no anticancer effect, other dietary factors may make more important contributions to the reduction in the risk of cancer associated with a diet high in vegetables and fruits."
166,1617601,Screening for breast cancer using mammography has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer. The authors attempted to determine if use of a wallet-size plastic screening &quot;credit&quot; card would increase participants' compliance for subsequent mammograms when compared with traditional methods of increasing compliance.,"Two hundred and twenty consecutive women, ages 40-70 years, undergoing their first screening mammography were recruited and assigned randomly to four groups receiving (1) a reminder plastic credit card (2) reminder credit card with written reminder; (3) appointment card; and (4) verbal recommendation. Return rates of the four groups were determined after 15 months.",The return rate for subsequent mammograms was significantly higher for participants (72.4%) using the credit card than for participants (39.8%) exposed to traditional encouragement/reminders (P less than 0.0001).,"The credit card was designed to show the participant's screening anniversary, and the durability of the card may have been a factor in increasing the return rate. The use of reminder credit cards may increase compliance for periodic screening examinations for other cancers and other chronic diseases."
167,8537804,The purpose of this study was to determine if a breast self-examination (BSE) &quot;prompt&quot; on oral contraceptive pill (OCP) packages would improve the frequency and timing of BSE among women who use OCPs.,"Women between 13 and 40 years of age who were initiating, restarting, or continuing use of OCPs completed a baseline survey that assessed health behavior and practices. All received BSE education, and then were randomized to take either OCPs with a BSE prompt or regularly packaged OCPs (without BSE prompt) for three cycles. Three months later, subjects completed a follow-up survey that assessed BSE frequency and timing. A telephone survey of randomly selected subjects conducted 6 months after the baseline survey assessed BSE compliance after discontinuation of the prompt.","Of the 907 subjects at baseline, 49.3% performed BSE monthly but only 24.5% performed BSE during the correct time of the menstrual cycle. Among subjects who never performed BSE prior to the study, 40.3% of prompt subjects and 36.4% of the education-only subjects began BSE by the 3-month survey. Among subjects who performed BSE less than once per month at baseline, 50.9% of prompt subjects and 45.5% of education-only subjects increased the frequency of BSEs to a monthly basis by the 3-month survey. More women performed BSE during the correct time of the menstrual cycle at the 3 month follow-up survey (68.1% prompt, 62.2% education only) and 6-month survey (57.4% prompt, 48.9% education only) when compared with the baseline survey (24.7% prompt, 24.1% education only). Ninety-one percent of women in this study expressed a preference for a BSE prompt on OCP packaging.","An increased frequency of BSE was observed when women were exposed to an OCP package prompt, particularly for women who at baseline were already partially compliant with performing monthly BSE. A small but significant improvement was observed for correct BSE timing and this effect continued after the prompt was removed, although at a reduced level. The innovative BSE prompt was overwhelmingly well received by women in this study."

The analyses of the main effects of the intervention were based on analyses of covariance.","The patients in the intervention group showed significantly less fatigue, greater vigor, and lower total mood disturbance compared with the controls, and they used significantly more active-behavioral and active-cognitive coping than the patients in the control group. The improvements were only significant at first follow-up.","The findings of this study support the results of an earlier intervention study among patients with malignant melanoma and indicate that a psychoeducational group intervention for such patients can decrease psychological distress and enhance effective coping. However, this effect is short term and the clinical relevance is not obvious."

The data was analyzed by Repeated Measures ANOVA, the Friedman test, and the Mann-Whitney test using the SPSS window version 12.0 program.",This study showed that the score of self-care practices and quality of life for the experimental group under telephone counseling were higher than those of the control group.,"This study revealed that a telephone intervention as supportive nursing care for women cancer patients under going chemotherapy was effective for self-care practices and qualify of life during the recovery period. Futhermore, this study also suggests that telephone counseling can serve as a continuing nursing supportive intervention for women cancer patients for the upcoming stages of further chemotherapy."
171,15983186,Geriatric assessment has been suggested as a possibly useful approach in dealing with frail elderly cancer patients.,"This was a secondary subset analysis from a randomized 2 x 2 factorial trial in 11 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers. Hospitalized, frail patients at least 65 years old, after stabilization of their acute illness, were randomized to receive care in a geriatric inpatient unit, a geriatric outpatient clinic, both, or neither. The interventions involved core teams that provided geriatric assessment and patient management. We identified 99 patients with a diagnosis of cancer by The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes, excluding all nonmelanoma skin cancers. Outcomes collected at discharge, 6 months, and 1 year after randomization were survival, changes in health-related quality of life (using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form general health survey [SF-36]), activities of daily living, physical performance, health service utilization, and costs.","There was no effect on mortality (1-year survival 59.6%). The changes in the SF-36 scores from randomization for emotional limitation, mental health and bodily pain (also sustained at 1 year) on the SF-36 were better for geriatric inpatient care cancer patients at discharge. There was no difference in SF-36 scores between geriatric outpatient and usual outpatient care. Days of hospitalization and overall costs were equivalent for the interventions and usual care over the 1-year study.",This study suggests that inpatient geriatric assessment and management may be an effective approach to the management of pain and psychological status in the elderly cancer inpatient at no greater length of hospitalization or extra cost than usual care.
172,9467701,"A comprehensive worksite health promotion program designed to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease among 4000 city of Birmingham employees was used to develop and implement a tailored antihypertensive educational intervention. The mean age of the underlying population was 36 years, 89% were blue-collar or unskilled workers, 50% were African Americans and 20% were female.","First, we identified barriers to hypertension control: low literacy, difficulty understanding the need for treatment of asymptomatic disease, and wide variability of health beliefs and priorities. We then tailored an educational program, which offered employees health education sessions on a variety of different topics, including heart disease, cancer, sleep disorders and back injury. All program materials focused on lifestyle changes and the need to seek medical care. This program was offered to all hypertensive workers; 130 chose to enroll, and 81 completed the program. These 81 participants were matched by age, sex, race and baseline BP with nonparticipating hypertensive workers (controls). Changes in SBP and DBP from before to after the educational program were used to evaluate the program.","Overall, intervention participants had a decrease of 4.5 mm Hg in mean SBP (different from zero, [p = 0.03]). African American participants showed a significant decrease (7.4 mm Hg, [p = 0.004]), as did unskilled intervention participants (SBP changes = 7.7 mm Hg, [p = 0.004]). Although not statistically significant, controls showed decreases in BP in the same direction.","An educational intervention tailored to the specific health perceptions and working conditions of a low literacy population is feasible, and may have a significant effect on hypertension control."
173,23508894,"A previous study investigated the effects of a well-documented COPD exercise protocol in lung cancer patients. The study showed improvements in physical fitness, but poor adherence to continued exercise after intervention. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a modified exercise intervention on post-intervention adherence, and physical fitness in a broad group of lung cancer patients.","Fifty-nine patients enrolled in a 9-week exercise program. Eligibility criteria were limited to presence of motivation, and absence of comorbidities that could jeopardize safety. The intervention included three times 3 weeks of exercise (3 weeks supervised, 3 weeks home-based and 3 weeks supervised). The patient's activities were structured by logbooks during the 3 weeks at home. VO2 max was estimated at baseline and at the end of intervention. Self-reported quality of life was recorded before and after the exercise program. Post-intervention exercise activity was assessed by telephone interviews 4 weeks after intervention.","Fifty-one patients initiated the exercise intervention and 29 patients successfully completed the exercise program. Full data were available for 25 patients regarding estimated VO2 max. Twenty-six of the 29 were available for follow-up with respect to continuance of physical activity. Among the 26 who completed the 9-week training program, 18 (69 %) continued to be physically active on a daily basis. No change in estimated VO2 max was observed. A trend towards increased quality of life and better symptom control was noted.","The present study showed an increased level of continuance of physical activity compared to the previous study. The present study could, however, not repeat the significant improvements in estimated VO2 max from the previous study."
174,11783170,"To observe the effect of Yiqi Huoxue (Replenishing Qi and activating blood circulation, YQHX) decoction in patients with advanced stage esophageal cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT) and intervention chemotherapy (ICT).","In comparing 31 patients who were treated with RT and ICT (Group A), and 31 patients treated with RT and ICT plus YQHX decoction (Group B).","Immediate effective rate were 48.4% in Group A and 64.5% in Group B (P &gt; 0.05).

The 1 year metastasis rate in Group A was higher than that in Group B, but the long-term survival rate of Group B was obviously higher than that in Group A (P &lt; 0.05).","YQHX decoction could reduce the inhibition of bone marrow caused by radiotherapy and intervention chemotherapy, lower the metastasis rate, prolong the long-term survival rate and improve the quality of life."
175,12195637,"Workplace cancer prevention initiatives have been least successful with blue-collar workers. This study assess whether an intervention integrating health promotion with occupational health and safety results in significant and meaningful increases in smoking cessation and consumption of fruits and vegetables, compared to a standard health promotion intervention, for workers overall and for blue-collar workers in particular.","A randomized controlled design was used, with 15 manufacturing worksites assigned to a health promotion (HP) or a health promotion plus occupational health and safety intervention (HP/OHS), and compared from baseline (1997) to final (1999). The response rates to the survey were 80% at baseline (n = 9019) and 65% at final (n = 7327). Both groups targeted smoking and diet; the HP/OHS condition additionally incorporated reduction of occupational exposures.","Smoking quit rates among blue-collar workers in the HP/OHS condition more than doubled relative to those in the HP condition (OR = 2.13, p = 0.04), and were comparable to quit rates of white-collar workers. No statistically significant differences between groups were found for mean changes in fruits and vegetables.",Integration of occupational health and safety and health promotion may be an essential means of enhancing the effectiveness of worksite tobacco control initiatives with blue-collar workers.
176,23142798,"Hypothesis. Withania somnifera is an herb with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antistress, and adaptogenic properties. Previous studies have shown its antistress effects in animals. Traditional Indian medicine has used it for centuries to alleviate fatigue and improve general well-being.","This is an open-label prospective nonrandomized comparative trial on 100 patients with breast cancer in all stages undergoing either a combination of chemotherapy with oral Withania somnifera or chemotherapy alone. The chemotherapy regimens were either taxotere, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide or 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide. Withania somnifera root extract was administered to patients in the study group at a dose of 2 g every 8 hours, throughout the course of chemotherapy. The quality-of-life and fatigue scores were evaluated before, during, and on the last cycles of chemotherapy using the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Version 3), Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS), and Schwartz Cancer Fatigue Scale (SCFS-6).","The median age distributions in the study and control arm were 51 years (range = 36-70) and 50.5 years (range = 32-71), respectively. The majority (77%) of patients had stage II and III disease. Patients in the control arm experienced statistically significant higher estimated marginal means of fatigue score compared with the study group (P &lt; .001 PFS, P &lt; .003 SCFS-6). Furthermore, various symptom scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 were statistically significant in 7 out of 18 symptoms in the intervention group compared with the control group (P &lt; .001). The 24-month overall survival for all stages in study and control group patients were 72% versus 56%, respectively; however, the result was not significant (P = .176), at a median follow-up duration of 26 months.","Withania somnifera has potential against cancer-related fatigue, in addition to improving the quality of life. However, further study with a larger sample size in a randomized trial is warranted to validate our findings."
177,28481837,The aim of this study was to investigate possible statistical mediators in a randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on pain intensity in women treated for primary breast cancer.,"The sample consisted of 129 women treated for breast cancer, presenting with persistent pain, who were randomly assigned to MBCT or a wait-list control. We previously reported a statistically significant and robust effect of MBCT on pain intensity (11-point numeric rating scale), which was included as the primary outcome. The proposed mediators were mindfulness (the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), self-compassion (the Short-Form Self-Compassion Scale), and pain catastrophizing (the Pain Catastrophizing Scale). Measurement points included baseline (T1), postintervention (T2), and 3- (T3) and 6-month (T4) follow-ups. All indirect effects of the mediators were tested in separate Multilevel Models, using the product-of-coefficients approach with bias-corrected confidence intervals (95% BSCI). The statistically significant mediators were then included in a multiple mediator model.","Statistically significant indirect effects were found for mindfulness nonreactivity (B=-0.17, BSCI [-0.32 to -0.04]) and pain catastrophizing (B=-0.76, BSCI [-1.25 to -0.47]). No statistically significant indirect effect was found for self-compassion (B=-0.09, BSCI [-0.30 to 0.04]). In a multiple mediator model, including mindfulness nonreactivity and pain catastrophizing, only pain catastrophizing remained statistically significant (B=-0.72, BSCI [-1.19 to -0.33]), explaining 78% of the effect.",The results of the present study may have clinical implications. An increased focus on the proposed mediators may optimize the clinical use of MBCT for persistent pain in women treated for breast cancer.
178,25753889,"Hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS) are experienced by up to 80% of prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This study evaluates the effects of a guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention on HFNS problem-rating (primary outcome), HFNS frequency, mood and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) in patients undergoing ADT.","Patients reporting treatment-induced HFNS were randomly assigned to CBT (n\u2009=\u200933) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n\u2009=\u200935), stratified for cancer type. The CBT intervention included a booklet, CD plus telephone contact during a 4-week period. Validated self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline, 6 weeks and 32 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was HFNS problem rating (perceived burden of HFNS) at 6 weeks after randomisation. Potential moderators and mediators were examined. Data analysis was conducted on a modified intention-to-treat basis.","Compared with TAU, CBT significantly reduced HFNS problem rating (adjusted mean difference: -1.33, 95% CI -2.07 to -0.58; p\u2009=\u20090.001) and HFNS frequency (-12.12, 95% CI -22.39 to -1.84; p\u2009=\u20090.02) at 6 weeks. Improvements were maintained at 32 weeks, but group differences did not reach significance. There were significant reductions in negative HFNS Beliefs and Behaviours following CBT, but not in mood or quality of life.",Guided self-help CBT appears to be a safe and effective brief treatment for men who have problematic HFNS following prostate cancer treatments. Further research might test the efficacy of the intervention in a multicentre trial.
179,26766737,Treatment of prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with metabolic changes that have been linked to an increase in cardiovascular risk.,"This randomised controlled trial investigated the effects of a 12-week lifestyle intervention that included supervised exercise training and dietary advice on markers of cardiovascular risk in 50 men on long-term ADT recruited to an on-going study investigating the effects of such a lifestyle intervention on quality of life. Participants were randomly allocated to receive the intervention or usual care. Cardiovascular outcomes included endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery), blood pressure, body composition and serum lipids. Additional outcomes included treadmill walk time and exercise and dietary behaviours. Outcomes were assessed before randomisation (baseline), and 6, 12 and 24 weeks after randomisation.","At 12 weeks, the difference in mean relative FMD was 2.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-4.3, P=0.04) with an effect size of 0.60 (95% CI &lt;0.01-1.18) favouring the intervention group. Improvements in skeletal muscle mass, treadmill walk time and exercise behaviour also occurred in the intervention group over that duration (P&lt;0.05). At 24 weeks, only the difference in treadmill walk time was maintained.",This study demonstrates that lifestyle changes can improve endothelial function in men on long-term ADT for prostate cancer. The implications for cardiovascular health need further investigation in larger studies over longer duration.
180,11489728,"The results of epidemiologic and animal studies support the role of a low-fat diet supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids contained in fish oil in preventing the development and progression of prostate cancer. As a first step in studying the role of a low-fat, fish oil-supplemented (LF/FOS) diet in a clinical setting, we conducted a prospective study in men with untreated prostate cancer to evaluate whether a 3-month dietary intervention affects the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids in plasma and gluteal fat. In addition, we evaluated the feasibility of studying cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in serial prostate needle biopsy specimens before and after the diet.","Nine men with untreated prostate cancer consumed an LF/FOS diet for 3 months. Plasma, gluteal adipose tissue, and prostate needle biopsy specimens were obtained from each patient before and after the intervention. The fatty acid compositions of the plasma and gluteal adipose tissue were determined by gas-liquid chromatography, and the COX-2 expression in the prostatic tissue specimens was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).","Short-term intervention with an LF/FOS diet caused a significant increase in the omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid ratio in plasma (P = 0.002) and gluteal adipose tissue (P = 0.002) in men with prostate cancer. The COX-2 expression in prostatic tissue was quantitated by RT-PCR in 7 of 9 patients, and COX-2 expression decreased in 4 of these 7 patients.",A short-term dietary intervention in men with prostate cancer leads to a significant increase in the omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid ratios in plasma and adipose tissue. The potential for this diet to prevent the development and progression of prostate cancer by way of altered COX-2 expression and prostaglandin production in prostatic tissue requires further study.
181,16360449,To evaluate the effects of prostatic massage on the serum complexed PSA (cPSA) concentration in various prostatic diseases.,"A total of 51 men who presented to our outpatient clinic for the first time with symptoms of lower urinary outflow obstruction were included in this study. Blood samples were obtained from each patient before and 30 minutes after prostatic massage. Total PSA (tPSA), free PSA (fPSA), and cPSA levels were measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay.","After prostatic massage, the tPSA and fPSA levels and fPSA/tPSA ratio increased significantly (P &lt; 0.0001), and the increase in cPSA was minimal but statistically significant (P = 0.047). In patients with prostate cancer, no significant increase occurred in the mean forms of PSA (tPSA, cPSA, and fPSA/tPSA ratio), except for fPSA, after prostatic massage. We observed a greater increase in all PSA forms in the chronic prostatitis group.","In this study, prostatic massage increased serum cPSA concentration, but to a lesser extent than tPSA and fPSA."
182,24026982,"Education-based interventions for cancer-related fatigue have shown promise in adults undergoing radiotherapy. Research on the cancer-related fatigue intervention trial (CAN-FIT) programme found that pre-radiotherapy fatigue information and support (pre-RFES) did not improve levels of fatigue, but was associated with improvements in activity-based outcomes. We aimed to measure whether pre-RFES resulted in greater participant self-ratings of their performance of daily living activities, fatigue, quality of life and distress.",Thirty people undergoing radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy were randomly allocated to either a 1-h RFES session from the CAN-FIT programme (delivered individually to participants and modified where necessary for patients undergoing chemotherapy) or standard care. Measures were taken pre- and post-treatment and 6 weeks after completing treatment.,There was no significant difference between groups on performance of daily living activities or ratings of distress. Further analysis found a significant difference between the control and treatment groups for EQ-5D health state visual analogue scale (-9.05 [-18.09; -0.018]; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) and physical fatigue (2.86 [0.58; 5.14]; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.02) with the treatment group rating their overall health state worse and their physical fatigue higher than the controls.,"Pre-RFES delivered individually did not significantly improve participants' ratings of their performance of daily occupations and was unexpectedly associated with worse overall health state and higher physical fatigue. Future trials, ideally comparing individual and group education to exercise programmes or cognitive-behavioural approaches, are recommended to examine the broader question of whether discussing fatigue might actually make participants feel worse."
183,16731125,The role of electroacupuncture in postthoracotomy pain control is uncertain. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the role of electroacupuncture in the management of early postthoracotomy wound pain.,"A total of 27 patients with operable non-small cell lung carcinoma who received thoracotomy were recruited and randomized to receive either electroacupuncture or sham acupuncture in addition to routine oral analgesics and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for postoperative pain control. All patients received acupuncture twice daily with visual analog pain score recorded for the first 7 postoperative days. Specific chest acupoints (LI 4, GB 34, GB 36, and TE 8) were targeted. Patient-controlled analgesia was used for the first 3 postoperative days in all patients, and the cumulative dosage used was recorded.","Two patients were excluded after randomization because of complications unrelated to acupuncture. Interventions and data collection were completed for the remaining 25 patients (13 in the electroacupuncture group; 12 in the sham acupuncture group). There was a trend for lower visual analog scale pain scores in the electro-acupuncture group between postoperative days 2 and 6, although this did not reach statistical significance. The cumulative dose of patient-controlled analgesia morphine used on postoperative day 2 was significantly lower in the electroacupuncture group (7.5 +/- 5 mg versus 15.6 +/- 12 mg; p &lt; 0.05). Such delay of onset of pain control may be related to the frequency of electroacupuncture used.",Electroacupuncture may reduce narcotic analgesic usage in the early postoperative period. A prospective randomized controlled trial using different electroacupuncture frequency is warranted to verify this benefit.
184,29168064,"Obesity is a leading modifiable contributor to breast cancer mortality due to its association with increased recurrence and decreased overall survival rate. Obesity stimulates cancer progression through chronic, low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissue, leading to accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs), in particular, the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype macrophage. Exercise has been shown to reduce M1 ATMs and increase the more anti-inflammatory M2 ATMs in obese adults. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 16-week exercise intervention would positively alter ATM phenotype in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.","Twenty obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors were randomized to a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise (EX) intervention or delayed intervention control (CON). The EX group participated in 16\u00a0weeks of supervised exercise sessions 3 times/week. Participants provided fasting blood, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and superficial subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue biopsies at baseline and following the 16-week study period.","EX participants experienced significant improvements in body composition, cardiometabolic biomarkers, and systemic inflammation (all p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.03 vs. CON). Adipose tissue from EX participants showed a significant decrease in ATM M1 (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001), an increase in ATM M2 (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001), increased adipose tissue secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as adiponectin, and decreased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- \u03b1 (all p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.055).",A 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention attenuates adipose tissue inflammation in obese postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.

185,27531024,"Sedentary behavior is recognized as an independent risk factor for chronic diseases. Cancer survivors report high levels of sedentary behavior. In secondary analyses, we examined the effects of an exercise intervention on sedentary behavior (sitting time) among breast cancer survivors.","Seventy-six breast cancer survivors (mean age\u00a0=\u00a055.62\u00a0y, mean 1.1\u00a0y since diagnosis) were randomized to receive either a 12-week telephone-delivered exercise intervention from peer volunteers or a contact control condition. The intervention did not specifically address sitting time. Participants' sedentary behavior was assessed for 7\u00a0days at baseline, 12\u00a0weeks, and 24\u00a0weeks via self-report and objective measurement (accelerometer).","At baseline, our sample reported sitting for 7.75\u00a0hours/day (10.98\u00a0h/d by accelerometer data). Spearman rank correlations showed significant positive correlations at baseline between sitting time measured by self-report and accelerometer (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.37; P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) in the entire sample. There were no significant changes over time within group nor were there any significant intervention effects on sitting time (self-report and objective) at 12 and 24\u00a0weeks (all P's\u00a0&gt;\u00a0.05).",An exercise intervention that did not focus specifically on sitting time did not affect sedentary behavior among breast cancer survivors. Intervention components that specifically target sitting behavior are needed to reduce this risk behavior among survivors.
186,11783207,To study the clinical significance of rectal infusion of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) plus high dose fluorouracil emulsion in treating rectal carcinoma.,"The 86 patients of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into CHM plus chemotherapy group and single chemotherapy group, and the changes of T-lymphocyte cell subset, natural killer (NK) activity, pathologic picture and clinical symptoms were analysed statistically before and after treatment.","In the single chemotherapy group, the CD3 cell and NK activity decreased after treatment and most of the peri-carcinoma cellular infiltration were in grade I. In the CHM plus chemotherapy group, the CD3, CD4/CD8 and NK activity restored and CD8 lymphocyte decreased markedly after treatment in comparing with those before treatment (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), and most of the peri-carcinoma cellular infiltration concentrated in grade III.","Chemotherapy alone could suppress cellular immune function significantly, significant immunoregulation and improvement of symptoms (as mucous-bloody stool, frequent defecation) could be obtained by combination therapy of CHM and chemotherapy."
187,29725798,The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of exercise program and a group psychotherapy program on mood profile of Greek cancer patients as well as to make the necessary comparisons.,"The sample consisted of 39 cancer patients (10 males and 29 females), randomly assigned to the three following groups: control, exercise and psychotherapy groups (13 patients in each group). The duration of the training program for the individuals of the exercise group was 10\u00a0weeks with two sessions per week, lasting 60\u00a0min each. The patients of the psychotherapy group received 10\u00a0weeks of supportive-expressive group therapy, once a week, 90\u00a0min long. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire was administered to examine the short-term effect of both programs before and after intervention in terms of distinct mood states. Control group individuals did not participate in any program and they just filled in the POMS questionnaire before and after intervention.","Post hoc analysis revealed an anger reduction, as regards the supportive therapy group presenting statistically significant results from both the control group (-\u20096.91\u00a0units drop in anger subscale score, p\u2009&lt;\u2009.001) and the exercise group (-\u20094.75\u00a0units drop in anger subscale score, p\u2009=\u2009.007). Regarding total POMS score, results also favored the supportive therapy group as compared to the control group (-\u200928.95\u00a0units drop in total POMS score, p\u2009=\u2009.001). Post-intervention values were also improved for the exercise group, but not to the extent to produce statistically significant results.","The findings of this study strongly support the beneficial effect of psychological intervention on anger and total mood score of patients with cancer, followed by the positive effect of the exercise program but not to the same extent as in the case of supportive therapy intervention."
188,26812553,"Metacognitive therapy (MCT) is an effective psychological treatment for a range of emotional disorders. However, the applicability of MCT to treating emotional distress in physical health populations has yet to be tested. The present study examined the potential of MCT for alleviating emotional distress in adolescent and young adult cancer (AYAC) survivors.","Twelve AYAC survivors, aged 18-23, who had completed acute medical treatment participated in this pilot open trial with 6 months follow-up. Each participant completed a baseline period followed by 8-14 sessions of MCT that targeted perseverative thinking (worry and rumination), attentional control, and metacognitive beliefs. The primary outcome variable was severity of depression and anxiety symptoms as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).","MCT was associated with large and statistically significant reductions in anxiety, depression, trauma symptoms, and metacognitive beliefs and processes. In the intention-to-treat sample, 50% of participants met standardized criteria for recovery on the HADS at posttreatment and these gains were maintained through to 6-month follow-up.",MCT is a promising transdiagnostic approach to treating different forms of emotional distress in AYAC survivors. Further investigation in controlled trials is now warranted.

The adaptation to cancer care of a validated, cost-effective intervention may offer a practicable solution. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical effectiveness of protocol-driven cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for insomnia, delivered by oncology nurses.","Randomized, controlled, pragmatic, two-center trial of CBT versus treatment as usual (TAU) in 150 patients (103 females; mean age, 61 years.) who had completed active therapy for breast, prostate, colorectal, or gynecological cancer. The study conformed to CONSORT guidelines. Primary outcomes were sleep diary measures at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Actigraphic sleep, health-related quality of life (QOL), psychopathology, and fatigue were secondary measures. CBT comprised five, small group sessions across consecutive weeks, after a manualized protocol. TAU represented normal clinical practice; the appropriate control for a clinical effectiveness study.","CBT was associated with mean reductions in wakefulness of 55 minutes per night compared with no change in TAU. These outcomes were sustained 6 months after treatment. Standardized relative effect sizes were large for complaints of difficulty initiating sleep, waking from sleep during the night, and for sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed spent asleep). CBT was associated with moderate to large effect sizes for five of seven QOL outcomes, including significant reduction in daytime fatigue. There was no significant interaction effect between any of these outcomes and baseline demographic, clinical, or sleep characteristics.",CBT for insomnia may be both clinically effective and feasible to deliver in real world practice.
193,11898235,Weight gain is a common side effect for women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and may have negative long-term implications for survival. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on weight gain in women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.,"Seventy-eight women who had recently received a diagnosis of breast cancer and who were beginning adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in a home-based exercise study during the first four cycles of chemotherapy. Weight change, body mass index, anorexia, nausea, fatigue, caloric expenditure during exercise, and functional ability were recorded.","Women who adhered to the exercise program maintained their body weight, while nonexercisers steadily gained weight (P &lt; .05). There were no differences in incidence or intensity of nausea or anorexia between the exercisers and nonexercisers. Women who exercised over the four cycles of chemotherapy improved their functional ability (mean 23%) compared to the nonexercisers who showed significant declines in functional ability (mean -15%).",Exercise may be an effective intervention to minimize weight gain in women with breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Preventing weight gain in these patients may be important in preventing recurrent disease and other comorbidities associated with excess weight.
194,12115339,"Previous research indicates that younger women (i.e., &lt;or= 50) with breast carcinoma experience greater emotional distress than older women (i.e., &gt; 50) and that coping style is significantly related to the psychosocial adjustment of women with this disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate through a randomized controlled trial the effectiveness of a problem-solving training intervention designed to empower women with breast carcinoma to cope with a range of difficulties when diagnosed in mid-life.","The study population consisted of women aged 50 years or younger who had no prior history of breast carcinoma, were diagnosed with Stage I-IIIA tumors, and for whom a first course of chemotherapy had been initiated recently. The intervention consisted of two in-person and four telephone sessions with an oncology nurse who provided problem-solving skills training and informational materials to the women over a 12-week period. All subjects were assessed for physical and psychosocial adjustment through telephone and mailed surveys at baseline, at 4 -months, and at 8 months.","Of 183 eligible women, 164 participated (a 90% participation rate), 149 of whom completed the study (a 91% completion rate). The subjects had significantly lower unmet needs and better mental health at the 4-month assessment. The intervention significantly decreased the number and severity of difficulties experienced by women with average or good problem-solving skills at 8 months, but was not effective in alleviating or resolving the problems encountered by women with poor problem-solving skills, relative to the control group.",We conclude that this problem-solving therapy-based home care training intervention is an effective method of helping the majority of women with breast carcinoma to reduce the stresses associated with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in mid-life.
195,21477901,"Inflammation is pivotal in all phases of atherosclerosis. Dietary options which lower inflammatory biomarkers would be an attractive strategy to reduce risk from cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Indeed, fruit and vegetable intake or fruit juice consumption is associated with health and wellness. However, there is a paucity of data examining the effect of orange juice on biomarkers of inflammation in healthy volunteers. We have previously conducted the first placebo-controlled randomized studies examining the effect of sterol fortified orange juice or sterol fortified reduced calorie orange juice beverage supplementation (2\u00a0g sterols/day) compared to Placebo OJ or Placebo OJBev, and showed significant benefits on the lipid profile as well as significant reduction in hsCRP, the prototypic marker of inflammation and a cardiovascular risk marker. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of orange juice (OJ) or OJ beverage (Bev) alone and fortified with plant sterols (1g/240\u00a0ml juice or beverage twice a day) on pro-inflammatory cytokines and PAI-1, a marker of impaired fibrinolysis in healthy human volunteers.","In the first study, 72 healthy human volunteers received Placebo OJ or Sterol OJ and in the second study, 72 volunteers received OJBev or Sterol OJBev for 8 weeks and blood was drawn at baseline and following supplementation for 8 weeks. Biomarkers of Inflammation (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF, IL-8, IL-10) were assessed in serum using the BD Human Inflammatory Cytokine Cytometric Bead Array and PAI-1 activity was assessed in citrated plasma.","OJ or OJBev alone failed to result in any significant effects on circulating cytokine levels or PAI-1 activity. There was a significant reduction in IL-1b with sterol fortified OJ (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) compared to baseline. In addition, both sterol fortified OJ as well as sterol fortified OJBev resulted in significant reductions in serum IL-6 levels (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01).","Thus, sterol fortified OJ and OJ Beverage are able to effectively lower biomarkers of inflammation in healthy human volunteers in addition to providing lipid profile benefits and may thus contribute to decreasing cardiovascular risk."
196,11972568,"The purpose of this experimental study was to test the effectiveness of a multiphasic culturally relevant intervention, delivered over a 1-year period to increase the rates of participation in fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) at the initial screening opportunity and at the 1-year follow-up screening opportunity among rural African American women.","The study used a pretest/post-test design among African American women who attended senior citizen centers in a rural southern state. The centers were randomly assigned to the cultural and self-empowerment group, who received the five-phased intervention, the modified cultural group, who received phase I of the intervention only, or the traditional group, who served as the control group. Data were collected at the initial and 1-year follow-up screenings. Hemoccult kits were distributed, collected, and analyzed at no cost to the participants. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, repeated measures, and longitudinal models for binary outcomes.",Women in the cultural and self-empowerment group had a significantly higher rate of participation in FOBT than did those in the modified cultural group and the traditional group. The modified cultural group had a significantly higher rate of participation in FOBT than the did the traditional group. Predictors of participation in FOBT were the women's family history of colorectal cancer and the average number of visits to their healthcare provider.,"Colorectal cancer screening and diagnostic testing opportunities should be offered consistently to women who visit their provider for routine, nonemergent office visits. As successful interventions to increase colorectal cancer screening are introduced into community settings, these interventions also should be tested within physicians' offices and other community agencies."
197,25917814,"Despite advanced medical treatment options, many prostate cancer patients are still confronted with unfavorable physical and psychological burdens. Physical exercise has proven to be beneficial for prostate cancer patients, yet specific exercise offers are rare. The ProRehab Study aimed to evaluate the exercise program offered in rehabilitative prostate cancer sports groups in Germany and determine whether it is beneficial for patients following prostatectomy.","Eighty-five prostate cancer patients were recruited for a multicenter, 2-armed, nonrandomized controlled trial 6 to 12 weeks after prostatectomy. The intervention group (n = 56) took part in a 15-month supervised multimodal exercise program. Exercise sessions took place once a week for 60 minutes at a moderate intensity (3.84-4.84 MET-hour). The control group (n = 29) received no intervention. Outcomes included aerobic fitness, activity levels, quality of life, disease- and treatment-related adverse effects, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, and relapse-relevant blood values. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed.","A significant between-group difference was observed in the urinary symptom score (P = .027). Physical fitness, urinary incontinence, physical, role, emotional, and social functioning, as well as further disease- and treatment-related side effects (dyspnea, urinary, and bowel symptoms) significantly improved within the intervention group. Erectile dysfunction and physical activity levels improved similarly in both groups.","The presented data hint at the potential of rehabilitative sports groups for prostate cancer patients. However, according to the current state of the art, exercise intensity and volume may need to be increased to enhance the effects. A number of shorter studies (8-24 weeks) have proven significant between-group differences in quality of life, incontinence, and fitness outcomes when patients exercised 2 to 3 times per week. This is the first exercise intervention study with prostate cancer patients that was conducted over 15 months. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether prostate cancer patients recover sooner when receiving a supervised exercise program."
198,18300337,This study examined change in self-efficacy as a mediator of the effects of a mailed print intervention on the dietary and exercise practices of newly diagnosed breast and prostate cancer survivors.,"A total of 543 breast and prostate cancer patients were recruited from 39 states and two provinces within North America. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 10-month program of tailored mailed print materials that aimed to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, reduce fat intake, and/or increase exercise or a 10-month program of publically available materials on diet and exercise. Telephone surveys conducted at baseline and 1 year assessed dietary practices, physical activity, and self-efficacy for engaging in these health behaviors.","Results indicated that changes in self-efficacy for fat restriction and eating more fruits and vegetables were significant mediators of the intervention's effects on dietary outcomes at 1-year follow-up. The intervention did not significantly affect self-efficacy for exercise; however, a significant, positive relationship was found between self-efficacy for exercise and exercise duration at follow-up.",Findings are largely consistent with Social Cognitive Theory and support the use of strategies to increase self-efficacy in health promotion interventions for cancer survivors.
199,9099400,"The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), a randomized clinical trial for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease, enrolled 12,866 men (including 8194 cigarette smokers) aged 35-57 years at 22 clinical centers across the United States. Participants were randomized either to special intervention (SI), which included an intensive smoking cessation program, or to usual care (UC). After 16 years of follow-up, lung cancer mortality rates were higher in the SI than in the UC group. Since rates of smoking cessation in SI were higher than those for UC for the 6 years of the trial, and since risk of lung cancer mortality is known to decline with smoking cessation, these results were unexpected. The purpose of the present study was to investigate hypotheses that could explain the higher observed lung cancer mortality rates in the SI as compared with the UC group.",Analytic methods were employed to determine whether SI and UC participants differed either in baseline characteristics or in characteristics that changed during the trial and to determine whether these differences could explain the higher rates of lung cancer mortality among SI as compared to UC participants. Rates of mortality from coronary heart (CHD) were examined to explore the possibility that prevention of CHD death may have contributed to greater mortality due to lung cancer in the SI group.,"From randomization through December 1990, 135 SI and 117 UC participants died from lung cancer. The relative difference between the SI and U groups adjusted for age and number of cigarettes smoked per day, was 1.17 (95% CI:0.92-1.51). The greatest difference between the SI and UC groups in lung cancer mortality rates occurred among the heaviest smokers at baseline who did not achieve sustained smoking cessation by year 2. In this group the rates of death from CHD were approximately the same among the SI and UC subjects. No differences in baseline characteristics were found between SI and UC smokers who did not achieve sustained cessation by year 2, and there were no differences in follow-up characteristics between the two study groups that could explain the difference in lung cancer mortality.","None of the hypotheses proposed to explain the unexpected higher rates of lung cancer mortality among SI as compared with UC subjects were sustained by the data. Thus we conclude that the difference observed is due to chance, and that a longer period of sustained smoking cessation plus follow-up is necessary to detect a reduction in lung cancer mortality as a result of smoking cessation intervention in a randomized clinical trial."
200,28987237,"Elevated circulating insulin is associated with increased risk of recurrence and cancer mortality in early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of a 12-week home-based exercise program on fasting insulin, adipocytokines, and physical function in CRC survivors.","One hundred and twenty-three stage II-III CRC patients were randomly assigned to either a home-based exercise (n=62) or standard care control group (n=61) for 12weeks. Home-based exercise consisted of aerobic and resistance training, with a goal of obtaining \u226518 metabolic equivalent task (MET)-h/wk. Participants in the exercise group were instructed to participate in &gt;18MET-h/wk. of aerobic and resistance exercise while the participants in the control group were asked to maintain their usual daily activity. The primary outcome was fasting insulin levels. Secondary outcomes were adiponectin, TNF-\u03b1 levels and 6min walk distance from baseline to post-intervention.","After the 12-weeks, moderate-vigorous physical activity participation increased from 9.1\u00b114.7MET-h/wk. to 26.6\u00b121.7MET-h/wk. in the exercise group, with no change in the control group (p&lt;0.01 for group and time interaction).

A similar trend was observed in TNF-\u03b1 (p=0.030 for group and time interaction). Six minute walk distance increased by 25.2m in the exercise group with no change in the control group (p=0.061 for group and time interaction).",The 12week home-based exercise program increased level of physical activity and decreased circulating insulin levels in CRC survivors.
201,15695785,Salivary gland dysfunction is one of the common side effects of high-dose radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an early start of sucking lemon candy decreases salivary gland injury after radioiodine therapy.,"The incidence of the side effects of radioiodine therapy on the salivary glands was prospectively and longitudinally investigated in 2 groups of patients with postsurgical differentiated thyroid cancer with varying regimens for sucking lemon candy. From August 1999 to October 2000, 116 consecutive patients were asked to suck 1 or 2 lemon candies every 2-3 h in the daytime of the first 5 d after radioiodine therapy (group A). Lemon candy sucking was started within 1 h after radioiodine ingestion. From November 2000 to June 2002, 139 consecutive patients (group B) were asked to suck lemon candies in a manner similar to that of group A. In the group B, lemon candies were withheld until 24 h after the ingestion of radioiodine. Patients with salivary gland disorders, diabetes, collagen tissue diseases, or a previous history of radioiodine therapy or external irradiation to the neck were excluded. Thus, 105 patients in group A and 125 patients in group B were available for analysis. There were no statistical differences in the mean age (55.2 y vs. 58.5 y), average levels of serum free thyroxine (l-3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine) (0.40 ng/dL vs. 0.47 ng/dL), and the mean dose of (131)I administered (3.96 GBq vs. 3.87 GBq) between the 2 groups. The onset of salivary side effects was monitored during hospital admission and regular follow-up on the basis of interviews with patients, a visual analog scale, and salivary gland scintigraphy using (99m)Tc-pertechnetate. When a patient showed a persistent (&gt;4 mo) dry mouth associated with a nonfunctioning pattern on salivary gland scintigraphy, a diagnosis of xerostomia was established.","The incidences of sialoadenitis, hypogeusia or taste loss, and dry mouth with or without repeated sialadenitis in group A versus group B were 63.8% versus 36.8% (P &lt; 0.001), 39.0% versus 25.6% (P &lt; 0.01), and 23.8% versus 11.2% (P &lt; 0.005), respectively. Permanent xerostomia occurred in 15 patients in group A (14.3%) and 7 patients in group B (5.6%) (P &lt; 0.05). In both groups, bilateral involvement of the parotid gland was the most frequently seen and was followed by bilateral involvement of the submandibular gland.",An early start of sucking lemon candy may induce a significant increase in salivary gland damage. Lemon candy should not be given until 24 h after radioiodine therapy.
202,17686823,"Primary liver cancer is a common malignancy with a dismal prognosis. New primary prevention strategies are needed to reduce mortality from this disease. We examined the effects of supplementation with four different combinations of vitamins and minerals on primary liver cancer mortality among 29450 initially healthy adults from Linxian, China.","Participants were randomly assigned to take either a vitamin-mineral combination (&quot;factor&quot;) or a placebo daily for 5.25 years (March 1986-May 1991). Four factors (at doses one to two times the US Recommended Daily Allowance)-retinol and zinc (factor A); riboflavin and niacin (factor B); ascorbic acid and molybdenum (factor C); and beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, and selenium (factor D)-were tested in a partial factorial design. The study outcome was primary liver cancer death occurring from 1986 through 2001. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of liver cancer death with and without each factor. All P values are two-sided.","A total of 151 liver cancer deaths occurred during the analysis period. No statistically significant differences in liver cancer mortality were found comparing the presence and absence of any of the four intervention factors. However, both factor A and factor B reduced liver cancer mortality in individuals younger than 55 years at randomization (HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.34 to 1.00, and HR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.93, respectively) but not in older individuals (HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.59, and HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.75 to 1.68, respectively). Factor C reduced liver cancer death, albeit with only borderline statistical significance in males (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.47 to 1.02) but not in females (HR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.72 to 2.37). Cumulative risks of liver cancer death were 6.0 per 1000 in the placebo arm, 5.4 per 1000 in the arms with two factors, and 2.4 per 1000 in the arm with all four factors.","None of the factors tested reduced overall liver cancer mortality. However, three factors reduced liver cancer mortality in certain subgroups."
203,17870203,"Radiation induced lung toxicity (RILT) is the main adverse effect in the radiation therapy of lung cancer. However, the optimal management of RILT has not been defined. In this paper, we investigated the effects of rhubarb extract on RILT, pulmonary function (PF), transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-beta1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.","We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eighty consecutive patients were randomly enrolled into two groups: trial group and control group. The trial group received three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) plus rhubarb (at a dose of 20 mg kg(-1) once a day) for 6 weeks. The control group received 3D-CRT plus a placebo containing starch for 6 weeks. Plasma TGF-beta1 and serum IL-6 were measured in all patients before, every 2 weeks during, and at 6 weeks after the completion of the treatment. RILT and PF were evaluated at 6 weeks and 6 months after the end of the treatment, respectively. The differences of TGF-beta1, IL-6, RILT, and PF between the two groups were analysed.","The incidence of RILT in the trial group was significantly lower than that in the control group at 6 weeks and 6 months after treatment (32.4% versus 56.7% at week 6, and 27.0% versus 52.8% at month 6, both P&lt;0.05). The plasma TGF-beta1 levels in the trial group were significantly lower than that in the control group during and after the treatment (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01, respectively). The serum IL-6 levels in the trial group were significantly lower than that in the control group during the treatment (all P&lt;0.01). The forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 1s (FEV1) at 6 weeks and the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) at 6 months in the trial group were significantly improved compared to the control group (P&lt;0.05 or 0.01, respectively).","The rhubarb extract significantly attenuated RILT and improved PF, probably by decreasing the level of TGF-beta1 and IL-6. These results may be of value for the prophylaxis of RILT, but the exact mechanisms underlying these prophylactic effects remain to be further explored."
204,22253295,"Folate is essential for one-carbon metabolism, a pathway required by DNA synthesis, methylation, and repair. Low dietary and circulating folate and polymorphic variation in this pathway are associated with increased risk of colorectal adenoma and cancer.","We genotyped 882 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 82 one-carbon metabolism genes for 1,331 cases of advanced colorectal adenoma, identified by sigmoidoscopy at baseline, and 1,501 controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). We evaluated associations between one-carbon genes and adenoma risk in all subjects and stratified by folate intake. We applied the Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (ARTP) method to assess statistical significance at the gene and pathway levels.","Folate intake was inversely associated with advanced colorectal adenoma risk [odds ratio (OR) by quartile = 0.85, P = 1.9 \u00d7 10(-5)]. We found no statistically significant associations between one-carbon genes and adenoma risk in all subjects. As hypothesized, we observed a statistically significant pathway-level association (P = 0.038) in the lowest quartile of folate; no significant associations were found in higher quartiles. Several genes including adenosine deaminase (ADA) and cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1) contributed to this signal (gene-level P = 0.001 and 0.0073, respectively). The most statistically significant SNP was rs244072 in ADA (P = 2.37 \u00d7 10(-5)).","Stratification by dietary folate and application of the ARTP method revealed statistically significant pathway- and gene-level associations between one-carbon metabolism genes and risk of advanced colorectal adenoma, which were not apparent in analysis of the entire population. Folate intake may interact with associations between common variants in one-carbon metabolism genes and colorectal adenoma risk."

206,29420749,The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a nutritional supplement with a high blend ratio of \u03c9-3 fatty acids can minimize weight loss and attenuate increases in inflammatory marker levels during the perioperative period in patients undergoing surgery for head and neck carcinoma.,"Patients with \u22655% weight loss within 6 months were considered as targets for aggressive nutritional intervention. Among these patients, those with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, who underwent major invasive surgery with free flap reconstruction were included in the present study. The patients were randomized into two groups: the 'nutritional supplementation group' and the 'non-intervention group'. The nutritional supplementation group received two packs of Prosure\u00ae (an eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]-enriched oral nutritional supplement) per day for 28 days during the perioperative period.","Compliance with the Prosure\u00ae dosage was very good at 6277/6720 ml (average) before surgery (93%) and 5229/6720 ml after surgery (78%), and a significant increase in EPA concentration was shown in the group that received Prosure\u00ae (P &lt; 0.0001: Welch's t-test). However, 28 days of nutritional supplementation did not lead to further weight change or changes in the inflammatory marker levels of patients were already showing cachexia (based on weight loss). Interestingly, no further change in the mean weight was noted in these patients. The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ between the two groups.","In this trial, immunonutritional therapy using a nutritional supplement with a high blend ratio of \u03c9-3 fatty acids from 2 weeks before surgery until 2 weeks after surgery was not effective for maintaining the nutritional status of head and neck carcinoma patients."
207,10898560,"Multimedia technology can be a valuable resource for health promotion and patient education initiatives because it allows messages to be presented within an environment that is both sensory-rich and interactive (i.e., the user can explore the information according to his or her particular needs and interests). Using clinic waiting time as an opportunity for breast cancer education, this investigation examined whether an educational intervention promoting breast cancer screening would be more effective when using interactive multimedia than when using written materials.","Over a five-month period, 108 women (40-70 years of age) from two clinics (a family practice clinic and a free clinic for the poor) participated in the study. Participants initially completed measures assessing perceptions of the personal importance of breast cancer, knowledge, and anxiety about screening procedures. They then were randomly assigned to receive breast cancer education by using an interactive multimedia program or by reading a brochure. Following the intervention, the participants once again completed the perceived importance, knowledge, and anxiety measures, and evaluated the educational materials.","These women perceived breast cancer to be a more personally important health issue, learned more, and reported less anxiety about cancer screening following the intervention regardless of method. Younger women learned more from the educational materials than did older women. Although the multimedia program received more favorable evaluations than the brochure, this effect was mediated by the message recipient's age, as younger women responded more favorably to the multimedia materials than did older women.","Preconsultation education is a valuable but rarely used opportunity to promote breast cancer screening. If well constructed, educational materials using a variety of media can be effective. While preferences for media may in part depend on the audience's age, considerably more research is needed to better understand how the interplay of media, message, and audience characteristics can help accomplish health-promotion objectives."
208,10458256,"To use a standardized videotape stimulus to assess the effect of physician compassion on viewers' anxiety, information recall, treatment decisions, and assessment of physician characteristics.","One hundred twenty-three healthy female breast cancer survivors and 87 women without cancer were recruited for this study. A randomized pretest/posttest control group design with a standardized videotape intervention was used. Participants completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), an information recall test, a compassion rating, and physician attribute rating scales.","Women who saw an &quot;enhanced compassion&quot; videotape rated the physician as warmer and more caring, sensitive, and compassionate than did women who watched the &quot;standard&quot; videotape. Women who saw the enhanced compassion videotape were significantly less anxious after watching it than the women in the other group. Nevertheless, information recall was relatively low for both groups, and enhanced compassion did not influence patient decisions. Those who saw the enhanced compassion videotape rated the doctor significantly higher on other positive attributes, such as wanting what was best for the patient and encouraging the patient's questions and involvement in decisions.","The enhanced compassion segment was short, simple, and effective in decreasing viewers' anxiety. Further research is needed to translate these findings to the clinical setting, where reducing patient anxiety is a therapeutic goal."
209,20607434,"U.S. Hispanic women suffer a disproportionate burden of cervical cancer, with incidence and mortality rates almost twice that of whites. Community health workers, or promotoras, are considered a potential strategy for eliminating such racial and ethnic health disparities. The current study is a randomized trial of a promotora-led educational intervention focused on cervical cancer in a local Hispanic community.","Four promotoras led a series of two workshops with community members covering content related to cervical cancer. Sociodemographic characteristics, cervical cancer risk, previous screening history, cervical cancer knowledge, and self-efficacy were measured by a pre-intervention questionnaire. The post-intervention questionnaire measured the following outcomes: cervical cancer knowledge (on a 0-6 scale), self-efficacy (on a 0-5 scale), and receipt of Pap smear screening during the previous 6 months (dichotomous). Univariate analyses were performed using chi square, t-test, and the Mann-Whitney test. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between explanatory variables and receipt of Pap smear screening.","There were no statistically significant differences between the two experimental groups at baseline. Follow-up data revealed significant improvements in all outcome measures: Pap smear screening (65% vs. 36%, p-value 0.02), cervical cancer knowledge (5.4 vs. 3.5, p-value&lt;0.001), and self-efficacy (4.7 vs. 4.0, p-value 0.002). In multivariate analysis, cervical cancer knowledge (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.10-2.81) and intervention group assignment (OR 6.74, 95% CI 1.77-25.66) were associated with receiving a Pap smear during the follow-up period.","Our randomized trial of a promotora-led educational intervention demonstrated improved Pap screening rates, in addition to increased knowledge about cervical cancer and self-efficacy. The observed association between cervical cancer knowledge and Pap smear receipt underscores the importance of educating vulnerable populations about the diseases that disproportionately affect them. Future research should evaluate such programs on a larger scale, and identify novel targets for intervention."

The current study investigated the differential impact of a multicomponent, targeted, low-literacy educational intervention compared with a standard, nontargeted educational intervention.",Patients aged 50 to 75 years who were of average CRC risk and not up-to-date with CRC screening were recruited from either a federally qualified health center or a primary care community health clinic. Patients were randomized to the intervention condition (targeted photonovella booklet/DVD plus FIT kit) or comparison condition (standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brochure plus FIT kit). The main outcome was screening with FIT within 180 days of delivery of the intervention.,"Of the 416 participants, 54% were female; the participants were racially and ethnically diverse (66% white, 10% Hispanic, and 28% African American), predominantly of low income, and insured (the majority had county health insurance). Overall, the FIT completion rate was 81%, with 78.1% of participants in the intervention versus 83.5% of those in the comparison condition completing FIT (P\u2009=\u2009 .17). In multivariate analysis, having health insurance was found to be the primary factor predicting a lack of FIT screening (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.26 [P\u2009=\u2009 .04]).","The multicomponent, targeted, low-literacy materials were not found to be significantly different or more effective in increasing FIT uptake compared with the nontargeted materials. Provision of a FIT test plus education may provide a key impetus to improve the completion of CRC screening. The type of educational material (targeted vs nontargeted) may matter less. The findings of the current study provide a unique opportunity for clinics to adopt FIT and to choose the type of patient education materials based on clinic, provider, and patient preferences.

211,15668500,Elevated benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-DNA adducts have been associated with 3-fold increased risk of lung cancer in current smokers. We assessed the chemopreventive effects of antioxidant supplementation using B(a)P-DNA adducts in leukocytes as an intermediate cancer risk marker.,"Subjects were randomized to a double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial of antioxidant vitamin supplementation [500 mg vitamin C and 400 IU vitamin E (dl-alpha-tocopherol) daily] or placebo. Smokers with &gt; or =10 cigarettes per day and serum cotinine &gt; or =25 ng/mL were eligible for the study. B(a)P-DNA adduct level was the outcome. The randomization was stratified by gender and cigarettes per day (&lt; or =20 or &gt;20). Smoking habits and blood samples were collected every 3 months during the 15-month treatment period. Samples were analyzed for B(a)P-DNA adducts (high-performance liquid chromatography), plasma cotinine, vitamin levels, and GSTM1 genotype. The intent-to-treat model adjusted for B(a)P-DNA and cotinine at randomization.","Overall and among men, there was no effect of treatment on B(a)P-DNA adduct levels. Among treated women, B(a)P-DNA adducts decreased by 31% compared with women on placebo (P = 0.03). Among treated women with the GSTM1 genotype, there was a 43% decrease in adducts (P = 0.04).","Our primary hypothesis that the mean level of smoking-related B(a)P-DNA adducts would be lower in all subjects in the vitamin treatment group compared with all placebo-treated subjects was not substantiated. However, oursecondary gender-specific analysis found a significant reduction in B(a)P-DNA adducts in women with vitamin treatment, suggesting that antioxidant supplementation maymitigate some of the procarcinogenic effects of exposuretoB(a)P. The effect in GSTM1-null women suggeststhat certain subgroups may derive more benefit fromsupplementation. Although the results of this trial showthe potential chemopreventive role of antioxidants, thebest way for smokers to reduce their cancer risk remains smoking cessation."
212,23220254,Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer is associated with many treatment side effects that tend to erode couples' intimacy. We piloted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of an educational intervention designed to preserve couples' intimacy in the face of ADT.,"Couples were recruited at the time the patient was first prescribed ADT and were randomized to a treatment or control group. Those in the treatment group were asked to read an educational guide and participate in an educational session designed to inform couples about possible ADT side effects and management strategies. To assess changes in the couples' relationships, they were administered the Dyadic Adjustment Scale and the Personal Assessment of Intimacy in Relationships questionnaire prior to randomization and again at 6 months.","While results were not statistically significant, trends and effect sizes suggest that the educational intervention helped attenuate declines in intimacy for patients, but not for their partners. Couples who participated in the intervention were more successful at maintaining sexual activity than were couples in the control group.","ADT places considerable strain on intimate relationships, particularly for the partners. It appears that patients who receive help in anticipating and managing ADT related changes report better dyadic adjustment and closer intimacy. More efforts are needed to develop interventions to benefit patients' partners. We conclude that the intervention holds promise and that a full-scale evaluation of the intervention is both feasible and warranted."
213,23341547,(1) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of a stress management intervention for caregivers of children recently diagnosed with cancer. (2) To explore whether caregivers with lower baseline perceived social support derive greater benefit from the intervention than those with higher perceived support.,"45 primary caregivers were randomly assigned to intervention or standard care. Of these, 37 completed measures of social support, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress at both pre-intervention (T1; mean = 24 days post-diagnosis) and post-intervention time points (T2; mean = 165 days post-diagnosis).","Enrollment, retention, and satisfaction data support feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. There was no overall significant impact of participation in the intervention on levels of distress at T2. However, T1 social support moderated intervention response, with caregivers who perceived lower T1 support showing greater psychological benefit from the intervention.",Primary caregivers with lower levels of perceived social support may benefit from preemptive stress management intervention.
214,10694559,"Hot flashes represent a significant clinical problem for some breast cancer survivors. Safe, effective treatment is needed for this prominent clinical problem. Although it has been shown that estrogen or progesterone replacement therapy can alleviate this problem, there are continued safety concerns regarding the use of hormonal therapies in these women. Based on anecdotal information, we hypothesized that soy-derived phytoestrogens, weak estrogen-like substances in the soybean that demonstrate estrogen agonist and/or antagonist effects when they bind to estrogen receptors, could alleviate hot flashes. This current trial was designed to investigate this hypothesis.","This double-blind clinical trial involved breast cancer survivors with substantial hot flashes. After randomization, patients underwent a 1-week baseline period with no therapy. This was followed by 4 weeks of either soy tablets or placebo. The patients then crossed over to the opposite arm in a double-blind manner for the last 4 weeks. Patients completed a daily questionnaire documenting hot flash frequency, intensity, and perceived side effects.","Of the 177 women who were randomized and started the study substance, 155 (88%) provided useable data over the first 5 weeks; 149 provided usable data over the entire 9 weeks. There was no suggestion that the soy product was more effective in reducing hot flashes than the placebo. At study completion, patients preferred the soy product 33% of the time, the placebo 37% of the time, and neither substance 31% of the time. No toxicity was observed.",The soy product did not alleviate hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.
215,29732483,"There is growing interest in integrating electronic patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures into routine oncology practice for symptom monitoring. Here, we evaluated the feasibility and accessibility of electronic PRO measures using a smartphone (PRO-SMART) for cancer patients receiving routine chemotherapy.",The proposed PRO-SMART application obtains daily personal health record (PHR) data from cancer patients via a smartphone. An analysis report of cumulative PHR data is provided to the clinician in a format suitable for upload to electronic medical records (EMRs). Cancer outpatients who had received at least two cycles of chemotherapy and who were scheduled for two more cycles were enrolled.,"Between February 2015 and December 2016, 111 patients were screened and 101 of these were included. One-hundred patients used PRO-SMART at least once and were included in the final analysis (90.1% overall accessibility among all screened patients). The number of symptomatic adverse events (AEs) related to chemotherapy recorded in EMRs (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) increased from 0.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.80 to 2.26\u2009\u00b1\u20091.80 (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), and grading of AEs increased from 0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.69 to 1.00\u2009\u00b1\u20090.62 (P\u2009=\u20090.029). After using PRO-SMART, the numeric rating scale for pain (mean \u00b1 SD) increased from 0.20\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72 to 0.99\u2009\u00b1\u20091.55 (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). A patient-reported questionnaire revealed that 64.2% of patients found it useful and 83% found it easy to use.",This study suggests that the proposed PRO-SMART is feasible and accessible for assessment of symptomatic AEs in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy for a prospective randomized trial.
216,1312773,We attempted to evaluate the effect of oral folic acid supplementation on the course of cervical dysplasia.,"A total of 235 subjects with grade 1 or 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of folic acid or a placebo daily for 6 months. Clinical status, human papillomavirus type 16 infection, and blood folate levels were monitored at 2-month intervals. Outcome data were subjected to chi 2 analysis.","The prevalence of human papillomavirus type 16 infection initially was 16% among subjects in the upper tertile of red blood cell folate versus 37% in the lower tertile (trend p = 0.035). After 6 months no significant differences were observed between supplemented and unsupplemented subjects regarding dysplasia status, biopsy results, or prevalence of human papillomavirus type 16 infection.","Folate deficiency may be involved as a cocarcinogen during the initiation of cervical dysplasia, but folic acid supplements do not alter the course of established disease."
217,29538220,"This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicine warm compress (CMWC) on back meridians in relieving cancer pain, reducing adjuvant analgesic doses and adverse reactions, and improving the quality of life (QOL).","A total of 62 patients (age range 39-82 years) diagnosed with a malignant tumor and suffering from cancer-related pain were randomly divided into a treatment group (group A) and a control group (group B) (n\u200a=\u200a31 for each). The patients in both groups were administered appropriate drugs for 2 cycles of 7-day treatments according to the World Health Organization (WHO) 3-step ladder for cancer pain relief in adults. In addition, a CMWC was given to patients in group A. Pain relief was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) at various time points before and after interventions in each group. Alteration of analgesic doses, adverse reactions, performance status (PS), and QOL were evaluated and any differences between groups A and B evaluated.","VAS scores at various time points after treatment were significantly decreased compared with the baseline level in group A. Overall response rate was significantly improved in group A compared with group B (70.97% vs 29.03%, P\u200a&lt;\u200a.001). Significant differences in clinical pain relief efficacy in various locations were found in group A after treatment vs before treatment (P\u200a&lt;\u200a.05). Adjuvant analgesic doses were significantly changed in the control group compared to the treatment group after 1 cycle of 7-day treatment (22.58% vs 12.90%, P\u200a=\u200a.023).

218,11920549,The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an individualized uncertainty management intervention delivered by telephone to Caucasian and African-American men with localized prostate carcinoma and directed at managing the uncertainties of their disease and treatment.,"The authors delivered a psychoeducational intervention by phone to men with prostate carcinoma, with or without supplemented delivery to a close family member, that was directed at managing uncertainty and improving symptom control. One hundred thirty-four Caucasian men and 105 African-American men were assigned randomly to one of two approaches to delivering the intervention or to the control condition. Men entered the study immediately after surgical treatment or in the first 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Trained nurses delivered the intervention through weekly phone calls for 8 weeks.","The authors found that the majority of intervention effects were from baseline to 4 months postbaseline, when treatment side effects are most intense. Both Caucasian men and African-American men who received either one of the two approaches for delivering the intervention improved in the two uncertainty management methods of cognitive reframing and problem solving. Similarly, when the intervention groups were combined, men who received the intervention also improved significantly in control of incontinence by 4 months postbaseline. Decreases in the number of treatment side effects differed by time and treatment/ ethnic group interactions as did satisfaction with sexual functioning.","This is one of the first tests of a psychoeducational intervention among men with prostate carcinoma and was the first test that included a sufficient number of African-American men to test by ethnic group. Therefore, replication of these findings is advised."
219,9678615,Attendance level has been identified as a major determinant of cost-effectiveness of organized screening programs. We tested the effectiveness of 4 different invitation systems in the context of an organized population screening program for cervical and breast cancer.,"Women eligible for invitation--8385 for cervical and 8069 for breast cancer screening--listed in the rosters of 43 and 105 general practitioners (GP), respectively, who had accepted to collaborate in the program, were randomized to 4 invitation groups: Group A--letter signed by the GP, with a prefixed appointment; Group B--open-ended invitation, signed by the GP, prompting women to contact the screening center to arrange an appointment; Group C--letter (same as for group A), signed by the program coordinator, with a prefixed appointment; Group D--extended letter (highlighting the benefits of early cancer detection) signed by the GP, with a prefixed appointment. Assignment to the interventions was based on a randomized block design (block=GP).","Assuming Group A as the reference, the overall compliance with cervical cancer screening was reduced by 39% in Group B (RR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.56-0.68) and by 14% in Group C (RR=0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93); no difference was observed for Group D (RR=1.03; 95% CI, 0.95-1.1). The response pattern was similar for breast screening (Group B: RR=0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.76; Group C: RR=0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.94; Group D: RR=1.01; 95% CI, 0.94-1.08).","Personal invitation letters signed by the woman's GP, with preallocated appointments, induce a significant increase in compliance with screening.

220,11260571,"Children with leukemia undergo painful procedures such as lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration. To overcome pain, certain units offer total anesthesia; others offer generic support; others offer no preparation at all. Since September, 1997, we have provided leukemic children with art therapy (AT), a nonverbal and creative modality that develops coping skills. Our goal is to prevent anxiety and fear during painful interventions as well as prolonged emotional distress.","We treated 32 children aged 2-14 years. The modes of AT before, during, and after the punctures were as follows: clinical dialogue to calm children and help them cope with painful procedures; visual imagination to activate alternative thought processes and decrease the attention towards overwhelming reality and raise the peripheral sensitivity gate; medical play to clarify illness, eliminate doubts, and offer control over threatening reality; structured drawing to contain anxiety by offering a structured, predictable reality (the drawing) that was controllable by children; free drawing to allow children to externalize confusion and fears; and dramatization to help children accept and reconcile themselves to body changes.","Children hospitalized before September, 1997, exhibited resistance and anxiety during and after painful procedures. By contrast, children provided with AT from the first hospitalization exhibited collaborative behavior. They or their parents asked for AT when the intervention had to be repeated. Parents declared themselves better able to manage the painful procedures when AT was offered.",AT was shown to be a useful intervention that can prevent permanent trauma and support children and parents during intrusive interventions.
221,19629583,"Past trials have shown perioperative immunonutrition to improve the outcome for patients with gastric cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative oral immunonutrition on cellular immunity, the duration of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and detailed postoperative complications in patients with gastric cancer.","Sixty patients with gastric cancer were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received immune-enhanced formulas supplemented with arginine and omega-3 fatty acids (immune-enhancing diet (ID) group, n = 30); the other received standard formulas (conventional diet (CD) group, n = 30) for 7 days before the operation. These groups were well matched in terms of age, sex, operations, cancer stages, and intraoperative variables. The postoperative outcome was evaluated based on clinical variables, including postoperative infectious complications, noninfectious complications, and SIRS duration. In addition, the perioperative state of cellular immunity was evaluated and compared between the two groups.","The incidence of postoperative infectious complications in the ID group (6%) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower than that of the CD group (28%). The duration of SIRS in the ID group (0.77 +/- 0.9 days) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) shorter than that in the CD group (1.34 +/- 1.45 days). The postoperative lymphocyte and CD4(+)T-cell counts significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) in both groups. However, the number of CD4(+)T-cells on preoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7 was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher in the ID group than in the CD group.","Preoperative oral immune-enhanced formulas supplemented with arginine and omega-3 fatty acids enhanced the immune status of the patients, reduced the duration of SIRS, and decreased the incidence of postoperative infectious complications. CD4(+)T-cell immunity likely played an important role in the modulation of the postoperative immune and inflammatory response after gastrectomy."
222,29607686,"This study sought to describe changes in the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of women who do and do not seek naturopathic oncology (NO) complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) care during and immediately after breast cancer treatment, and to explore the predictive role of NO CAM care, demographic characteristics, and involvement in decision-making on HRQOL in breast cancer survivors.","Matched cohorts of breast cancer survivors who did and did not choose to supplement their breast cancer treatment with NO care within 2 years of diagnosis participated. NO users were identified through naturopathic doctors' clinics and usual care (UC) controls with similar prognosis were identified through a cancer registry. The registry provided information about all participants' age, race, ethnicity, marital status, stage of cancer at time of diagnosis, date of diagnosis, and use of conventional medical treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and endocrine therapy). Data of participants' self-reported involvement in decision-making and HRQOL were collected at study enrollment and at 6-month follow-up.","At 6-month follow-up, the NO patients reported significantly more involvement in decision-making about care and better general health than did UC patients ( P &lt; .05). Self-reported involvement in decision-making about cancer treatment was associated with better role-physical, role-emotional, and social-functional well-being ( P &lt; .05). Race, age, marital status, and congruence of preferred and achieved levels of involvement also predicted aspects of HRQOL in breast cancer survivors ( P &lt; .05).",Both NO CAM care and involvement in decision-making about cancer treatment may be associated with better HRQOL in breast cancer survivors.

Changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), myocardial enzyme spectrum (MES) and ultrasono-cardiogram (USCG) before and after treatment were observed.","After treatment, the incidence of abnormal ECG was lower in the treated group than in the control group (6.7% vs 30.0%); significant differences were found between the two groups in the parameters of MES (P&lt; 0.05); USCG showed significant difference between the two groups in left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDd), left ventricular systolic diameter (LVDs), ratio of early and late diastolic transmitral peak flow velocity (E/A) and fractional shortening (FS), while there was no significant difference in ejection fraction (EF).",Egb761 is an ideal drug for preventing and reducing the acute doxorbincin-induced cardiotoxicity; it could also be helpful for alleviating the chronic cardiotoxicity.
224,22051143,"Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) has become an indispensable organ, but not always function preserving treatment modality for advanced head and neck cancer. To prevent/limit the functional side effects of CCRT, special exercise programs are increasingly explored. This study presents cost-effectiveness analyses of a preventive (swallowing) exercise program (PREP) compared to usual care (UC) from a health care perspective.","A Markov decision model of PREP versus UC was developed for CCRT in advanced head and neck cancer. Main outcome variables were tube dependency at one-year and number of post-CCRT hospital admission days. Primary outcome was costs per quality adjusted life years (cost/QALY), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as outcome parameter. The Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) was calculated to obtain the value of further research.","PREP resulted in less tube dependency (3% and 25%, respectively), and in fewer hospital admission days than UC (3.2 and 4.5 days respectively). Total costs for UC amounted to \u20ac41,986 and for PREP to \u20ac42,271. Quality adjusted life years for UC amounted to 0.68 and for PREP to 0.77. Based on costs per QALY, PREP has a higher probability of being cost-effective as long as the willingness to pay threshold for 1 additional QALY is at least \u20ac3,200/QALY. At the prevailing threshold of \u20ac20,000/QALY the probability for PREP being cost-effective compared to UC was 83%. The EVPI demonstrated potential value in undertaking additional research to reduce the existing decision uncertainty.","Based on current evidence, PREP for CCRT in advanced head and neck cancer has the higher probability of being cost-effective when compared to UC. Moreover, the majority of sensitivity analyses produced ICERs that are well below the prevailing willingness to pay threshold for an additional QALY (range from dominance till \u20ac45,906/QALY)."

Of the 2082 patients considered compliant at 1 year, 77% remained compliant at 2 years. Discontinuations (9%) were mainly attributed to AI-related side effects (68% of discontinuations). Exploratory analyses suggest a relationship between patient characteristics and compliance behaviors.",EMs do not improve compliance in this patient population. Compliance and persistence are complex end points influenced by multiple variables. Side effects were the main reasons for discontinuations.
226,16135469,"Evidence suggests that the re-entry phase (ie, early period after medical treatment completion) presents distinct challenges for cancer patients. To facilitate the transition to recovery, we conducted the Moving Beyond Cancer (MBC) trial, a multisite, randomized, controlled trial of psychoeducational interventions for breast cancer patients.","Breast cancer patients were registered within 6 weeks after surgery. After medical treatment, they completed baseline measures and were randomly assigned to standard National Cancer Institute print material (CTL); standard print material and peer-modeling videotape (VID); or standard print material, videotape, two sessions with a trained cancer educator, and informational workbook (EDU). Two primary end points were examined: energy/fatigue and cancer-specific distress. Secondary end points were depressive symptoms and post-traumatic growth. Perceived preparedness for re-entry was analyzed as a moderator of effects.","Of 558 women randomly assigned to treatment, 418 completed the 6-month assessment and 399 completed the 12-month assessment. In analyses controlling for study site and baseline depressive symptoms, VID produced significant improvement in energy/fatigue at 6 months relative to CTL, particularly among women who felt less prepared for re-entry at baseline. No significant main effect of the interventions emerged on cancer-specific distress, but EDU prompted greater reduction in this outcome relative to CTL at 6 months for patients who felt more prepared for re-entry. Between-group differences in the primary outcomes were not significant at 12 months, and no significant effects emerged on the secondary end points.","A peer-modeling videotape can accelerate the recovery of energy during the re-entry phase in women treated for breast cancer, particularly among those who feel less prepared for re-entry."

Among gynecologic patients, 87% of the EUC group and 94% of the TPN group completed chemotherapy (41% of the EUC group and 31% of the TPN group completed it with delays), 7% of the EUC group and 6% of the TPN group failed to complete chemotherapy, 6% of the EUC refused chemotherapy, 87% of the EUC group and 84% of the TPN group completed radiation (51% of the EUC group and 42% of the TPN with delays), 5% of the EUC group and 8% of the TPN group failed to complete radiation, and 8% of the EUC group and 5% of the TPN group refused radiation.","Treatment adherence across randomized groups was notably higher than reported in previous studies, suggesting that active telephone patient navigation or written resource informational materials may facilitate adherence among low-income, predominantly Hispanic women. Adherence also may have be facilitated by federal-state breast and cervical cancer treatment funding."
230,17624606,"This pilot study examined the effects of a self-administered, home-based exercise (HBE) rehabilitation programme designed to help women regain shoulder mobility immediately following surgery for a modified radical mastectomy and axillary node dissection.","Twenty-seven women who were scheduled for surgery were randomly assigned to either a post-surgical experimental HBE rehabilitation group (n = 16) or a usual care group (UC; n = 11). Women assigned to the HBE group followed an 11 day (days 3-14 post-surgery), home-based rehabilitation programme consisting of shoulder flexibility and stretching exercises that were described on videotape. The videotape programme was modelled after the exercises and guidelines described in a brochure produced by the Canadian Cancer Society.","As a result of the exercise programme intervention, there was a time x group interaction indicating that the HBE group demonstrated a significantly greater increase in shoulder flexion range of motion (ROM) (p = 0.003) and abduction ROM (p = 0.036) when compared to the UC. There were no statistical differences in shoulder strength between groups over time. External rotation (p = 0.036) and grip strength (p = 0.001) significantly increased in both groups during the intervention period but there were no interaction effects. With respect to the forearm circumferences, there was a significant decrease over time (p &lt; 0.001) but no interaction between groups.",This HBE rehabilitation programme is an effective way to improve shoulder mobility and ROM during the immediate 2-week recovery period following surgery.
231,15939927,To evaluate the effectiveness of psychological intervention in the care of cancer patients and to determine whether routine use of individual psychological therapies is indicated.,"Patients with newly diagnosed gynecologic malignancies from August 1999 to November 2000 were recruited and randomly assigned to either a control group receiving routine medical care or to an intervention group receiving individual psychotherapy. A set of fixed-choice, self-report questionnaires assessing the patients' psychological status, quality of life, and their perceptions related to the medical consultations was completed at recruitment and then every 3 months for 18 months. Data analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle by fitting the data into a linear mixed-effects model. Multivariable analyses were performed to examine the effects of confounding factors.",One hundred fifty-five patients participated in the trial. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at baseline. There was a trend toward better quality of life and functional status and also improvement of the symptoms over time for both groups. No differences were found between the groups in the scores measured by any of the instruments at baseline and at any time points after the cancer diagnosis. Psychological intervention had no significant effects on the psychosocial parameters.,Routine use of psychological therapies as given in our format has no significant effect on the patients' quality of life and psychological status.
232,24688085,"This prospective randomized Phase II study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of an oral nutrition supplement composed of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, arginine and glutamine (beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate/arginine/glutamine) on radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients.","Forty patients with histologically proven head and neck cancer, treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy involving cisplatin were recruited. They were randomly assigned to the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate/arginine/glutamine supplement treatment group (Group A) or the control group that received no supplement (Group B). The primary endpoint of this study was the percentage of patients developing \u2265Grade 3 dermatitis. The secondary endpoints were the percentage of patients developing \u2265Grade 2 dermatitis, and the duration of each grade of dermatitis relative to the observation period.","The incidence of \u2265Grade 3 dermatitis did not differ between the two groups. However, as secondary endpoints of this study, the incidence of \u2265Grade 2 dermatitis was lower in Group A than B (62.6 vs. 94.4%; P &lt; 0.05), and the duration of \u2265Grade 1 dermatitis was shorter in Group A than B (44.8 vs. 56.7%; P &lt; 0.01), as was the duration of \u2265Grade 2 dermatitis (16.5 vs. 26.5%; P &lt; 0.05).",Our study indicated that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate/arginine/glutamine supplementation was potentially effective in the prevention of radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients.
233,18281663,"Accumulating data suggest that exercise may affect breast cancer risk and outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that high levels of insulin, often seen in sedentary individuals, are associated with increased risk of breast cancer recurrence and death. We sought to analyze whether exercise lowered insulin concentrations in breast cancer survivors.","One hundred one sedentary, overweight breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned either to a 16-week cardiovascular and strength training exercise intervention or to a usual care control group. Fasting insulin and glucose levels, weight, body composition, and circumference at the waist and hip were collected at baseline and 16 weeks.","Baseline and 16-week measurements were available for 82 patients. Fasting insulin concentrations decreased by an average of 2.86 microU/mL in the exercise group (P = .03), with no significant change in the control group (decrease of 0.27 microU/mL, P = .65). The change in insulin levels in the exercise group seemed greater than the change in controls, but the comparison did not reach statistical significance (P = .07). There was a trend toward improvement in insulin resistance in the exercise group (P = .09) but no change in fasting glucose levels. The exercise group also experienced a significant decrease in hip measurements, with no change in weight or body composition.","Participation in an exercise intervention was associated with a significant decrease in insulin levels and hip circumference in breast cancer survivors. The relationship between physical activity and breast cancer prognosis may be mediated, in part, through changes in insulin levels and/or changes in body fat or fat deposition."
234,15917066,"A relatively simple procedure, the Pap test, is effective in detecting early changes in the cervix; however, many at-risk women, even in developed countries, do not have regular Pap tests.","A randomized controlled trial of an interactive voice response (IVR) cervical screening brief advice involving 17,008 households is described. The IVR system automatically made calls to households and explained the nature of the call; selected one eligible woman aged 18-69 years; determined her screening status; delivered a message appropriate to her screening status; offered additional messages to counter common barriers; offered additional information on cervical screening and cancer; offered additional contact numbers; and offered to arrange for someone to call back. Cervical screening rate data were obtained from the Australian Health Insurance Commission (HIC) for 6 months before and following the intervention.","The cervical screening rate was found to have increased by 0.43% in intervention compared to the control postcodes, and the increase was greater for older women at 1.34%.",The overall conclusion was that IVR technology was a feasible means to contact women to deliver brief interventions aimed at increasing cervical screening rates and could economically target at-risk groups. The potential for linking IVR to centralized Pap test Registers to issue Pap test reminders should be explored.
235,23576518,To examine the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) group intervention to facilitate improved psycho-sexual adjustment to treatment side effects in prostate cancer survivors post-radical prostatectomy.,"A randomised, wait-list controlled trial was conducted with a total of 60 men who participated in a manualised 8-week cognitive-behavioural group intervention 6\u2009months to 5\u2009years post-radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer. Participants completed standardised questionnaires pre-intervention and post-intervention, which assessed mood state, stress, general and prostate cancer anxiety, quality of life and areas of sexual functioning.","Paired samples t-tests identified a significant improvement in sexual confidence, masculine self-esteem, sexual drive/relationship and a significant decline in sexual behaviour from pre-intervention to post-intervention. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that after controlling for covariates, participation in the group intervention significantly improved sexual confidence, sexual intimacy, masculine self-esteem and satisfaction with orgasm.",This group-based CBT intervention for men post-radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer shows promising results in terms of improving quality of life.
236,21231792,"Patients with lung cancer are often burdened by dyspnoea, fatigue, decreased physical ability and loss of weight. Earlier studies of physical exercise of patients with COPD have shown promising results. The aim of this study was to investigate, if a well-documented COPD rehabilitation protocol can improve physical fitness and quality of life (QoL) in patients with lung cancer.","Forty-five patients, with a minimum walking distance of 50 meters, absence of cognitive deficits or severe heart disease and motivated for physical training were invited to an exercise intervention. The intervention consisted of seven weeks of twice weekly training, focusing on walking training, circuit training, handling of dyspnoea and instructions in daily diary-based training at home. Prior to, and after the intervention, Incremental- and Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT and ESWT) were performed, and pulmonary function as well as self-reported QoL (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and LC13) were measured.","Fourteen subjects dropped out before commencement of the intervention. Seven were excluded after physiotherapeutic evaluation. Of the remaining 24, three were excluded because of insufficient attendance (&lt;65% of scheduled exercise sessions) thus 21 patients completed the intervention. For 17 patients with complete pre- and post intervention data, ISWT increased 9% (-77 to 39%) (median and range) (p = 0.021), while ESWT increased 109% (-70 to 432%) (p = 0.002). Twelve of 17 improved in ISWT, while 15 improved in ESWT. No changes in pulmonary function and improvements in QoL were observed.","Patients with pulmonary cancer can achieve significant improvements in physical fitness measured with ISWT and ESWT after completion of the intervention program. No changes in pulmonary function and QoL were observed. In addition, we found that a large number of patients dropped out before intervention and that the patients, who succeeded, often discontinued training at home."
237,14751328,"Results from a single case-control study suggest that skin self-examination (SSE) has the potential to reduce mortality from melanoma by 63%. Despite these encouraging results, SSE rates are low. Few prospective studies of interventions to increase SSE in high-risk cohorts have been performed. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a brief nurse-delivered intervention using digital photographs on patients' adherence to performing SSE. DESIGN SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients at high risk for melanoma skin cancer (five or more dysplastic nevi) (N=100) were recruited from the outpatient Pigmented Lesion Clinic at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. All participants had baseline whole-body digital photography as part of their clinical evaluation.","Patients were randomized: Group A (n =49) received a teaching intervention (physician and nurse education module) with a photo book (personal whole-body photographs compiled in the form of a booklet, with nurse instruction on how to use the photographs); and Group B (n =51) received the teaching intervention only without a photo book. MAIN OUTCOMES/MEASURES: Self-administered questionnaires were provided at three intervals: baseline, post-teaching intervention, and at the 4-month post-baseline visit. To assess adherence with SSE, patients were asked, &quot;How many times in the past 4 months did you (or someone else) usually, thoroughly examine your skin?&quot;","In Group A (teaching intervention with photo book), 10.2% of the patients at baseline reported skin examination three or more times during the past 4 months, while 61.2% reported skin examination three or more times at the 4-month follow-up (p =0.039 for paired comparison). In Group B (teaching intervention only), nearly 20% of the patients at baseline reported skin examination three or more times during the past 4 months, while 37% reported skin examination three or more times at the 4-month follow-up (p =0.63). The increase in reported skin examination was compared between the two groups (&gt;51% v &gt;17.6%, p =0.001).",The results suggest that a brief nurse-delivered intervention is effective at increasing patient adherence with SSE. Utilizing digital photographs as an adjunct to screening appeared to increase patient adherence to performing SSE.
238,25724409,"Regular exercise and healthy eating are routinely recommended for breast cancer survivors, and past studies show benefits in quality of life and decreased inflammation. However, this has not been tested specifically in triple-negative breast cancer survivors. Increasing physical activity and losing body fat are thought to positively affect inflammatory biomarkers that have been associated with breast cancer. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to determine if participation in an exercise and dietary counseling program can improve body fat, physical function, and quality of life in survivors of this aggressive breast cancer. Secondarily, we sought to determine if participation in the program had beneficial effects on obesity-related markers of the adipokine profile.","Sixty-six survivors of triple-negative breast cancer with BMI &gt;25 were invited to participate. Twenty-eight enrolled and 23 completed the randomized, controlled trial (13 intervention, 10 control). Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (150 min per week, for 12 weeks) and diet counseling were compared to usual care, education only. The primary outcome of interest was weight loss (body mass, BMI, % fat), and secondary outcomes included physical function (exercise capacity), quality of life (Function After Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B)), cytokines (C-reactive protein (CRP), TNF-\u03b1, IL-6), and adipokine profile (leptin, adiponectin, insulin).","Participants in the program lost more body fat (2.4 % loss vs. 0.4 % gain, p &lt; 0.05) than the control group. The intervention group also improved quality of life (FACT-B total score +14 pts) and decreased sedentary time but did not improve peak exercise capacity. The intervention had no effect on serum cytokines and adipokines after 12 weeks in the program. However, serum leptin and adiponectin and their ratio were significantly correlated with BMI in the intervention group (p &lt; 0.05).",Exercise and dietary counseling led to loss of body fat and improved quality of life in survivors of triple-negative breast cancer. BMI was associated with favorable changes in leptin and adiponectin which may reflect a change in adiposity with intervention. Exercise and healthy eating may be equally effective in this high-risk population as in other breast cancer survivors and should be encouraged as a part of a cancer survivorship program.
239,21964222,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestions, Intensive Therapy (PLISSIT) model sexual program on female sexual function for women with gynecologic cancer.","The integrative 6-hr (two hours per session) program reflecting physical and psychosocial aspects of women's sexuality was developed based on Annon's PLISSIT model. Participants were 61 women with cervical, ovarian, or endometrial cancer. Of them, 29 were assigned to the experimental group and 32 to the control group. The women completed the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) including sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. Independent t-test and repeated measured ANOVA were used to test the effectiveness of the program.","Significant group differences were found on FSFI sub-domain scores including sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction but not pain. Significant time differences were found on all domains except for pain in the experimental group repeated measured ANOVA.",The results indicate that the three-week PLISSIT model sexual program is effective in increasing sexual function for women with gynecologic cancer. Nurses may contribute to improving women's sexual function by utilizing the program. Strategies to relieve sexual pain need to be considered for greater effectiveness of the program.
240,14745744,"The effects of a 6-week psychoeducational group intervention on the distress, coping, personal growth, and marital communication of wives of men diagnosed with prostate cancer were evaluated using a randomized clinical trial.","Sixty wives completed measures prior to random assignment to either the psychoeducational group intervention or a no-treatment control group, and 1 month after completion of the group.","No differences with regard to wives' general distress or cancer-specific distress were noted. In comparison with the control group, participants receiving the intervention perceived that having a spouse with prostate cancer had made positive contributions to their lives, reported gains in the use of positive reappraisal coping and reductions in denial coping.","Although the psychoeducational intervention did not result in changes in psychological distress, improvements in adaptive coping and indicators of psychological growth were found. The utility of group interventions for spouses of men with prostate cancer is discussed."
241,18091007,The purpose of this study was to examine the longer-term effects of pedometers and print materials on changes in physical activity (PA) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in breast cancer survivors who participated in a 3-month behavior change intervention.,"Breast cancer survivors (N = 377) were randomly assigned to receive either (a) a standard public health recommendation for PA (SR), (b) previously developed breast cancer-specific PA print materials (PM), (c) a step pedometer (PED), or (d) a combination of the two (COM). The primary endpoint was self-reported moderate/vigorous PA minutes per week at 6-month follow-up after the initial 3-month intervention period.","Seventy-one percent (266/377) of participants completed the 6-month follow-up assessment. According to intention-to-treat linear mixed-model analyses, self-reported moderate to vigorous PA increased by 9 min x wk(-1) in the SR group compared with 39 min x wk(-1) in the PM group (mean difference = 30 min x wk(-1); 95% CI = -44 to 104; P = 0.425), 69 min x wk(-1) in the PED group (mean difference = 60 min x wk(-1); 95% CI = -13 to 132; P = 0.107), and 56 min x wk(-1) in the COM group (mean difference = 47 min x wk(-1); 95% CI = -26 to 119; P = 0.210). The same pattern was observed for self-reported, brisk walking. No differences were found for HRQoL or fatigue.","Breast cancer-specific PM and PED did not maintain significantly higher PA or HRQoL at 6-month follow-up in breast cancer survivors, but the magnitude of the effect on PA (30-60 min x wk(-1)) was consistent with the immediate postintervention effect observed at the 3-month postintervention time point. Issues of power resulting from additional loss to follow-up may account for the failure to achieve statistical significance. Additional research with larger sample sizes and more complete follow-up is warranted."
242,23422867,This study aims to determine whether long-term isoflavone soy protein (ISP) supplementation affects endometrial thickness and rates of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in postmenopausal women.,"In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 350 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 92 years were randomized to a total daily dose of 154 mg of ISP or a milk protein-matched placebo for a 3-year period. Women with a surgically absent uterus were excluded from the analysis (final study population, N = 224). The main outcome measures were as follows: mean change in endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasound from baseline until up to 36 months of follow-up and the incidence of endometrial sampling, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer.","A total of 666 visits among 224 participants were evaluated. Treatment groups did not significantly differ on the mean baseline or on-trial changes in endometrial thickness. Of the 103 placebo-treated participants, 7 (6.8%) underwent endometrial biopsy; 6 (85.7%) of these biopsies were benign. One woman in the placebo group was diagnosed with complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia and underwent hysterectomy. The pathology result from this surgical operation was stage IB endometrial cancer. Of the 121 participants in the soy group, 9 (7.4%) underwent endometrial biopsy. The results were benign in all nine cases (100%). Although the rate of hyperplasia/malignancy was higher in the placebo group (14.3% vs 0%), the difference was not statistically significant.",Three-year ISP supplementation has no effect on endometrial thickness or on the rates of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in postmenopausal women.
243,12464864,"Previous trials showed that perioperative immunonutrition improved outcome in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. This study was designed to appraise the impact of the simple preoperative oral arginine and n-3 fatty acids supplementation on immune response, gut oxygenation, and postoperative infections.","Two hundred patients with colorectal neoplasm were randomized to: (a) oral intake for 5 days before surgery of a formula enriched with arginine and n-3 fatty acids (pre-op group; n = 50); (b) same preoperative treatment prolonged after surgery by jejunal infusion (peri-op group; n = 50); (c) oral intake for 5 days before surgery of a standard isoenergetic, isonitrogenous formula (control group; n = 50); and (d) no supplementation before and after operation (conventional group; n = 50). The immune response was measured by phagocytosis ability of polymorphonuclear cells and delayed hypersensitivity response to skin tests. Gut oxygenation and microperfusion were assessed by polarographic probes and laser Doppler flowmetry, respectively.","The 4 groups were comparable for demographics, comorbidity, and surgical variables. The 2 groups receiving immunoutrients (pre-op and peri-op) had a significantly better immune response, gut oxygenation, and microperfusion than the other 2 groups.

Postoperative prolongation with such supplemented formula has no additional benefit.
244,12697850,"In recent years, patients have indicated a desire for more information about their disease and to be involved in making decisions about their care. We developed an aid called the &quot;Decision Board&quot; to help clinicians inform patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer of the risks and benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy. We determined whether adding the Decision Board to the medical consultation improved patient knowledge and satisfaction compared with the medical consultation alone.","Between October 1995 and March 2000, 176 women with lymph node-negative breast cancer who were candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive the Decision Board plus the medical consultation (83 patients) or the medical consultation alone (93 patients). One week after the consultation, patients completed a questionnaire assessing their knowledge about breast cancer and chemotherapy. Satisfaction with decision making was assessed 1 week and 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization, and differences between groups were analyzed by a repeated measures analysis of variance. All statistical tests were two-sided.","Patients in the Decision Board arm were better informed about breast cancer and adjuvant chemotherapy than patients in the control arm (mean knowledge score = 80.2 [on a scale of 0-100], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 77.1 to 83.3, and 71.7, 95% CI = 69.0 to 74.4, respectively; P&lt;.001).

247,27369737,"There is a risk of decreased physical function, quality of life and persistent pain after open surgery for esophageal cancer. There are currently no studies that evaluate the effect of any postoperative intervention, including physical exercises, after this type of surgery. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate the effect of a training intervention after Ivor-Lewis resection of the esophagus.","Patients scheduled for esophagus resection according to Ivor-Lewis were randomized to an intervention group or a control group. The training intervention started at discharge and lasted three months. Before discharge, patients were given three leaflets with exercises to increase range of motion in the affected area and exercises aiming to restore lung function and physical function. All exercises were described in detail and the patients carried out the ones in the first program under supervision. Before surgery and three months after discharge, the patients estimated their level of physical function, level of physical activity, and quality of life. They also underwent spirometry, measurements of range of motion in the rib cage, spine, and shoulders, and three functional tests. Comparisons of differences within and between the groups were made.","A total of 43 of 64 randomized patients participated in the follow-up. Postoperatively, the patients in the intervention group had a significantly higher degree of physical function and less deteriorated range of motion in right shoulder flexion and thoracic left lateral flexion. There were no significant differences between the groups in lung function, pain, or quality of life.","The results of the three-month intervention indicate that specific training can positively affect physical function and range of motion to preoperative values. The intervention was well tolerated, and no side effects were registered."
248,22570263,"This research aimed to address the gap in evidence-based treatment available for cancer survivors who are experiencing cognitive dysfunction, through piloting a novel treatment intervention. The overall research question was whether a group cognitive rehabilitation intervention would be feasible for improving cognitive function and quality of life for people who have completed cancer treatment.","Three groups of adults were recruited as follows: an intervention group of 23 cancer survivors who completed a 4-week group cognitive rehabilitation treatment, a comparison group of nine cancer survivors, and a community sample of 23 adults who had never experienced cancer. Measures of objective and subjective cognitive function, quality of life, psychosocial distress, and illness perceptions were used. The research design was non-randomised.","The results indicated that the intervention was effective in improving overall cognitive function, visuospatial/constructional performance, immediate memory, and delayed memory beyond practice effects alone. It was helpful in reducing participants' perceptions of cognitive impairment and psychosocial distress, as well as promoting social functioning and understanding of cognition. The improvements were maintained at 3 months after the intervention. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the treatment.",The results provided evidence for the feasibility of a brief group-based cognitive rehabilitation intervention to treat cognitive problems experienced by cancer survivors.
249,10880033,A graded worksite intervention program to improve sun protection and skin cancer awareness of outdoor workers was implemented and evaluated longitudinally over a period of 20 months.,"Outdoor male workers (144/213 recruits) from geographically separated units of the Israel National Water Company were allocated to complete (n = 37), partial (n = 72) or minimal (n = 35) intervention groups. Subsequent to the assignment and training of local safety officers, an educational and medical screening package was provided to the corresponding groups either once, or repeatedly a year later. Personal sun protective gear was provided upon repeated intervention. Outcome measures were evaluated through self-response questionnaires administered prior to the first intervention pulse, and 8 months after the first and second interventions.","A 15-61% improvement in sun-protection habits was noted in the entire study population 8 months after initialization, compared to no sunscreen use, 20% sun-exposed skin area and highest mean occupational exposure dose of 1.68 MED/day at pre-test. An even greater use of sunscreen was evident 1 year later in the complete and partial intervention groups, + 80% and + 52%, respectively. The baseline rate of self-examination of the skin in the same two groups (49%) increased significantly at post-test (+ 71% and + 53%, respectively).",This integrated intervention program led to significantly improved sun protection and skin cancer awareness. Repeated intervention combined with the supply of sun-protective gear contributed to an even greater impact.

Twenty patients (mean age, 61 +/- 7.7 years) were randomly assigned to PRET or standard care intervention. Subjects assigned to the PRET group exercised three times per week for 12 weeks. The goal of the exercise program was to enhance scapular stability and strength of the upper extremity. The resistance-training program was progressive in terms of number of sets and repetitions performed, as well as the amount of weight lifted, depending on performance status.","The completion rate for the trial was 85% (17 of 20). The exercise group completed 93% of scheduled exercise sessions. Significant improvements were found in favor of the PRET group in active shoulder external rotation (p =.001), shoulder pain (p =.038), and overall score for shoulder pain and disability (p =.045).","The study results demonstrate a high rate of completion and adherence with our PRET program among patients with head and neck cancer. The preliminary findings, although limited, also suggest a potential therapeutic role for resistance exercise as an adjunct to standard physical therapy treatment."
251,28340011,To evaluate the efficacy of exercise prior to mammography in reducing perceived postexamination pain.,"An open, randomized, and controlled clinical trial was conducted. The interventions consisted of warm-up and stretching exercises of the upper or lower limbs of women who consulted at Barretos Cancer Hospital, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. The women were divided into three groups based on the intervention and its location: upper limbs (group 1), lower limbs (group 2), and no intervention (group 0). Quantitative variables were compared between and within groups using analysis of variance and Student's t test with a 5% significance level. Relative risk (RR) calculations and their derived measurements such as efficacy, number needed to treat (NNT), absolute risk reduction (ARR), and relative risk reduction (RRR) were taken. This study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Research Ethics.","A total of 198 (66 per group) women were evaluated. Sociodemographic data and level of physical activity were not found to be associated with perception of pain after mammogram. However, group 1 had the greatest reduction in postprocedure perception of pain compared with groups 2 (relative risk [RR]\u2009=\u20093.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.12-5.51, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05) and 0 (RR\u2009=\u20091.92 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.08-3.42, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).","Pre-examination upper limb exercises were most effective in reducing the perception and sensation of pain. However, women who performed lower limb exercises also had a decreased perception of pain compared with the control group."
252,24130255,Lack of trust and rapport with health care providers has been identified in the under-representation of racial/ethnic minorities within clinical trials. Our study used a coach to promote trust among minority patients with advanced cancer.,"Minority patients with advanced breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate carcinoma were randomly assigned to receive a coach Intervention (CI) or usual care (UC). All patients completed baseline and 6-month telephone interviews to assess demographics, trust in health care providers, attitudes toward clinical trials, and quality of life. Patients randomly assigned to CI were assigned a coach, who made biweekly contacts for 6 months to address general issues, progress or development in cancer care, and available resources. Patients randomly assigned to UC received the standard of care, without this intervention. Clinical trial enrollment was assessed.","Over 21 months, we screened 268 patients and enrolled 73 African Americans and two Asian Americans. Patients were randomly assigned to CI (n = 38) or to UC (n = 37). Longitudinal analyses were conducted on 69 patients who completed the 6-month follow-up assessment. Trial enrollment was 16 and 13 patients for the CI and UC groups, respectively. This difference was not significant (P = .351). Higher quality of life (1-point odds ratio on Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-General = 1.033, P = .036) and positive attitudes toward trials predicted enrollment. There was no significant difference between these groups in quality of life, attitudes toward clinical trials, perceptions of racism, trust in doctors, or depression.","Quality of life and positive attitude toward trials predicted trial enrollment, regardless of assignment to CI or UC."
253,17039380,To determine whether the impact of &quot;laying on of hands&quot; on the well-being of patients with advanced cancer is more efficient when performed by a person with self-declared &quot;healing powers&quot; as compared to an actor mimicking the healer in close detail.,"A total of 80 patients were registered to participate in a randomized, single-blind phase III trial to evaluate the difference in efficacy of &quot;laying on of hands&quot; by either a &quot;healer&quot; or an actor. Each group consisted of 40 patients, scheduled to receive treatment for 5 min, three times a week. The effect of treatment was measured using a &quot;Well-Being scale&quot;, with the difference of the average score of the &quot;Well-Being scale&quot; on day 10 being defined as primary and that on day 5 as secondary endpoint.","There was no significant difference in average score values between the &quot;healer&quot; and the actor with regard to the primary (p = 0.34) or the secondary endpoint (p = 0.94), but the comparison was limited due to major protocol violations by the &quot;healer&quot; who unblinded his status after the first run and quit the study. The study was completed by the actor as a descriptive, explorative study on the impact of &quot;laying on of hands&quot;. A significant improvement in symptoms after treatment was found on day 5 (p &lt; 0.001) and on day 10 (p = 0.0002).",&quot;Laying on of hands&quot; resulted in a significant improvement of cancer- or cancer-therapy-associated symptoms. The magnitude of improvement obtained was similar whether on a self-declared-healer- or an actor-provided &quot;treatment&quot;.
254,10518180,The psycho-oncology literature to date contains only one outcome study based on a group model for high-risk relatives of breast cancer patients. The authors set out to study the effects of group intervention in high-risk relatives of breast cancer patients.,"Thirty-three high-risk relatives of breast cancer patients participated in a six-session, 12-hour group intervention model that consisted of educational and psychosocial components.","There was a significant reduction of depression symptoms as reported on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Similarly, there was a significant reduction of anxiety symptoms as reported on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state scale.","In this pilot study, the investigators found the group intervention model effective at reducing symptoms of depression and reactive (not chronic) anxiety."
255,19679622,"This study compared the heart rate (HR), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), and blood lactate (BL) responses to aerobic exercise between posttreated breast cancer patients and apparently healthy, age-matched controls.","Seven patients and 7 control subjects underwent a submaximal treadmill test for the estimation of Vo(2max). Exercise intensities of 40%, 60%, and 70% of Vo(2max) were calculated from the treadmill test and randomly examined between groups during three 9-minute exercise bouts on 3 different days. Independent samples t tests were used to examine the HR, RPE, and BL responses at each intensity between groups.","No significant differences were observed between the control and patient groups for HR, RPE, and BL at 40% (101 +/- 9 vs 101 +/- 11 bpm, P = .979; 8 +/- 1 vs 9 +/- 3, P = .237; and 1.11 +/- 0.73 vs 1.26 +/- 0.64 mmol/L, P = .188, respectively) and 60% (127 +/- 17 vs 117 +/- 13 bpm, P = .523; 12 +/- 2 vs 11 +/- 3, P = .267, and 3.83 +/- 2.48 vs 2.23 +/- 1.65 mmol/L, P = .237, respectively) of Vo(2max) . At 70% of Vo(2max), no significant differences were found for HR (151 +/- 27 vs 135 +/- 13 bpm, P = .704) and RPE (14 +/- 1 vs 13 +/- 3, P = .181), but lower BL responses were observed in the patient group (7.70 +/- 1.62 vs 3.29 +/- 1.08 mmol/L, P &lt; .0005).","The results suggest similar HR, RPE, and BL responses between patients and control subjects at 40%, 60%, and 70% of Vo(2max) , except for BL at 70% of Vo(2max). The lower BL response in the patient group at 70% of Vo(2max) was somewhat unexpected. Further research is needed to confirm or refute the results of this study to allow for a clearer understanding of the physiological responses of breast cancer patients to aerobic exercise at moderate or higher intensities so that safer aerobic exercise prescriptions can be developed for this population."
256,17562086,To study the effect of support intervention on immune function in breast cancer patients.,"Breast cancer patients from an ongoing prospective randomised quality-of -life study were chosen for assaying immune functions in relation to a support-group intervention program running on a residential basis. Twenty-one women received adjuvant-combined radio-chemotherapy (CT-RT) and 20 women radiotherapy (RT). Eleven CT-RT and ten RT patients were randomised to support-group intervention, the rest served as controls. Immune tests for NK cells and NK-cell cytotoxicity, as well as lymphocyte subpopulations and response to antigen were performed before intervention, 2, 6, and 12 months later, in parallel to controls and healthy volunteers (n = 11). Depression, anxiety and fatigue were evaluated by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) and the Norwegian Fatigue questionnaire. The density of NK cell receptors and in vitro quantitation of functional NK cytotoxicity against K562 cell line were evaluated. Four-colour flow cytometry was used to detect signal transduction molecules and cytokine expression. T-cell proliferate response to purified protein derivate (PPD) antigen was evaluated.",No significant immune effect of support intervention could be found. The immune variables were severely disarranged compared to healthy volunteers but showed a statistically significant improvement over time. The majority of patients suffered from fatigue but had low scores for depression and anxiety.,No effect on immune parameters could be detected from support intervention. The long-lasting immune suppression might override a putative effect of the intervention. Low depression scores may contribute to the absence of a detectable effect.
257,14558957,"Oropharyngeal mucositis is the most common acute non-hematology toxicity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with radiotherapy, especially in the concomitant chemoradiotherapy of local advanced NPC patients. This study was designed to observe the effect of traditional Chinese medicine against acute oropharyngeal mucositis from chemoradiotherapy in patients with local advanced NPC.","A total of 101 patients in stage III- IVa (Fuzhou 1992) were enrolled into this prospective randomized clinical trial. The cases were divided into treatment group (52 cases) and control group (49 cases). The median doses were 70.31+/-1.21 Gy for the treatment group and 70.78+/-1.95 Gy for the control group, respectively. Chemotherapy was concomitant with radiotherapy [single agent cisplatin (DDP,30 mg/m(2)) 6 times from first to sixth week of radiotherapy duration].

258,19636983,"The aim of the present randomized intervention study was to investigate the effect of receiving extended cancer genetic information on counselees' knowledge, risk perception, information sharing and satisfaction with the service.","In total, 147 counselees, affected by cancer and/or a family history of cancer, were randomized to extended or standard information. The levels of counselees' knowledge and personal risk estimations were measured at four time points. In addition, counselees' satisfaction with the counseling and sharing of the information to at-risk relatives was assessed. The intervention included meeting a specialist nurse, learning the breaking bad news method, receiving written material and video-taped counseling sessions.","A significant increase in the level of knowledge in participants in the &quot;breast cancer group&quot; regardless of the randomization was observed over time. The correct estimation of personal risk increased significantly in both groups after two weeks, but declined at the eight month follow-up. Most of the participants had informed at-risk relatives about their visit at the cancer genetic clinic. The majority of respondents in both groups were highly satisfied with the counseling. The only observed effects of the intervention were that counselees in the intervention group were significantly more satisfied with the content of the given information and with the way of informing relatives.","Apparently, the current genetic counseling is managed properly and extended information does not seem necessary in all cases. However, some counselees need additional sessions."
259,29551558,"The use of a mobile health care application, the delivery of health care or health care-related services through the use of portable devices, to manage functional loss, treatment-related toxicities, and impaired quality of life in cancer patients during chemotherapy through supervised self-management has been increasing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of comprehensive mobile health care using a tailored rehabilitation program for colorectal cancer patients undergoing active chemotherapy.","A total of 102 colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy underwent 12 weeks of smartphone aftercare through provision of a mobile application and wearable device that included a rehabilitation exercise program and information on their disease and treatment. The grip strength test, 30-second chair stand test, 2-minute walk test, amount of physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire short-form), quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30), and nutritional status (Patient-generated Subjective Global Assessment) were assessed and measured at baseline, at mid-intervention (6 weeks), and at completion of the intervention (12 weeks). The rehabilitation exercise intensity was adjusted by the test results at every assessment and through real-time communication between the patients and clinicians.","Of the 102 patients, 75 completed all 12 weeks of the smartphone aftercare rehabilitation program. The lower extremity strength (P\u00a0&lt; .001) and cardiorespiratory endurance (P\u00a0&lt; .001) was significantly improved. Fatigue (P\u00a0&lt; .007) and nausea/vomiting (P\u00a0&lt; .040) symptoms were significantly relieved after the program.",A tailored rehabilitation exercise program provided through a comprehensive mobile health care application was effective in improving patients' physical capacity and treatment-related symptoms even during active chemotherapy.
260,17707296,"Adolescents with chronic illnesses have been shown to have management and treatment issues resulting in poor outcomes. These issues may arise from non-interest in self care and illness knowledge. A video game, &quot;Re-Mission,&quot; was developed to actively involve young people with cancer in their own treatment. Re-Mission provides opportunities to learn about cancer and its treatment.","The efficacy of Re-Mission was investigated in a multi-site, randomized, controlled study with 375 adolescent and young adult cancer patients. Participants received either a regular commercial game (control) or both the regular game plus Re-Mission (Re-Mission group). Participants were given a mini-PC with the games installed and requested to play for an hour each week for 3 months. A test on cancer-related knowledge was given prior to game play (baseline) and again after 1 and 3 months. At 3 months the Re-Mission group also rated the acceptability and credibility of Re-Mission.","Analyses of the knowledge test scores showed that whereas scores of both groups improved significantly over the follow-up periods, the scores of the Re-Mission group improved significantly more. The size of this effect was related to usage of Re-Mission. Credibility scores were negatively correlated with level of knowledge but not with change in knowledge level at 1 month or 3 months.",The results indicate a specific effect of Re-Mission play on cancer knowledge that is not attributable to patients' expectations. It is concluded that video games can be an effective vehicle for health education in adolescents and young adults with chronic illnesses.
261,24112099,"There has been little research published on the adaptation of diabetic exchange list diet approaches for the design of intervention diets in health research despite their clinical utility. The exchange list approach can provide clear and precise guidance on multiple dietary changes simultaneously. The present study aimed to develop exchange list diets for Mediterranean and Healthy Eating, and to evaluate adherence, dietary intakes and markers of health risks with each counselling approach in 120 subjects at increased risk for developing colon cancer.","A randomised clinical trial was implemented in the USA involving telephone counselling. The Mediterranean diet had 10 dietary goals targeting increases in mono-unsaturated fats, n-3 fats, whole grains and the amount and variety of fruits and vegetables. The Healthy Eating diet had five dietary goals that were based on the US Healthy People 2010 recommendations.","Dietary compliance was similar in both diet arms, with 82-88% of goals being met at 6 months, although subjects took more time to achieve the Mediterranean goals than the Healthy Eating goals. The relatively modest fruit and vegetable goals in the Healthy Eating arm were exceeded, resulting in fruit and vegetable intakes of approximately eight servings per day in each arm after 6 months. A significant (P &lt; 0.05) weight loss and a decrease in serum C-reactive protein concentrations were observed in the overweight/obese subgroup of subjects in the Mediterranean arm in the absence of weight loss goals.",Counselling for the Mediterranean diet may be useful for both improving diet quality and for achieving a modest weight loss in overweight or obese individuals.

265,10217373,"The Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Lung Cancer Chemoprevention Trial (CARET) ended prematurely due to the unexpected findings that the active treatment group on the combination of 30 mg beta-carotene and 25,000 IU retinyl palmitate had a 46% increased lung cancer mortality and a 26% increased cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo. This study was designed when the CARET intervention was halted to evaluate the effects of long-term supplementation with beta-carotene and retinol on serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, in an attempt to explore possible explanations for the CARET result.","Serum triglyceride levels, and total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were determined in a subgroup of 52 CARET participants. Baseline and mid-trial levels were available on 23 participants on placebo and 29 on active treatment who were then serially followed for 10 months after trial termination.","Triglyceride, and total, HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were similar in the two groups at baseline. After a mean of 5 years on the intervention there was a small nonsignificant increase in serum triglyceride levels in the active group, but no difference in total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol levels. After stopping the intervention there was a decrease in triglyceride levels in the active intervention group, and no change in the other parameters.","Based on a small convenience sample, CARET participants in the active treatment arm had a small nonsignificant increase in serum triglyceride levels while on the intervention, and a decrease in serum triglyceride levels after the intervention was discontinued. No significant changes in total or HDL cholesterol were noted. These results argue against a major contribution of treatment-induced changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein levels to the increased cardiovascular mortality in the active treatment group."

Quality-adjusted life years did not differ between participants who received the decision aid compared with usual care. The cost of BRECONDA was estimated to be small (AUD$10) relative to other health care interventions and resulted in decreased health care costs overall (AUD$764). Based on the point estimates, the decision aid was more effective and less costly (dominant) for all measures of effectiveness. It was estimated that the decision aid has an 87% probability of being cost-effective at $60\u00a0000 per quality-adjusted life year gained.",The BRECONDA web-based intervention designed to facilitate decisions regarding breast reconstruction surgery is likely to be cost-effective compared with usual care for women with breast cancer.

PSA in serum was measured at baseline and annually thereafter for 4 years, and newly diagnosed prostate cancers were recorded.","The individual PSA slope for each participant was calculated, and the distributions of slopes were compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference in distributions of the slopes (P =.99). The two groups were identical in the proportions of participants with elevated PSA at each time point. There was no difference in the PSA slopes between the two groups (P =.34) and in the frequencies of elevated PSA values for those with elevated PSA at baseline. Incidence of prostate cancer during the 4 years was similar in the two groups (19 and 22 in the control and intervention arms, respectively).","Dietary intervention over a 4-year period with reduced fat and increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fiber has no impact on serum PSA levels in men. The study also offers no evidence that this dietary intervention over a 4-year period affects the incidence of prostate cancer during the 4 years."
272,18702064,"Although women's breast cancer affects both women and their male partners, as well as their relationships, few interventions have been developed to work with couples confronting breast cancer. The current investigation presents the pilot results from a new couple-based intervention program for breast cancer that teaches couples how to minimize negative effects and maximize positive functioning during this difficult time.","In this pilot study, 14 couples in which the wife had early stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment conditions: Couple-based relationship enhancement (RE) or treatment-as-usual (TAU).","The results from this study suggest that compared with couples receiving treatment-as-usual, both women and men in the RE condition experienced improved functioning on individual psychological variables as well as relationship functioning at posttest and 1-year follow-up. In addition, women in RE show fewer medical symptoms at both time periods.","In this pilot study, the couple-based intervention, RE, has shown promise in improving individual, medical, and relationship functioning for couples in which the woman is facing breast cancer, and therefore merits further investigation on a larger scale."
273,26482004,"To investigate the effect of a home-based, nurse-led health program on quality of life and family function for postoperative patients with early-stage cervical cancer.","226 cervical cancer patients, from two hospitals between December 2012 and April 2014, were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Patients in the intervention group received an individual home-based, nurse-led health program (family-care team provision, physiological rehabilitation, emotion-release management, informal social support system, and follow-up monitoring), in addition to conventional nursing education. Patients in the control group only received conventional nursing education. The Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cervix, Female Sexual Function Index, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale were used for assessment before and after the intervention.","After the intervention, significant improvements were found for the quality of life total scores (t=-7.650, p=0.000), sexual function scores (t=-6.465, p=0.000), cohesion scores (t=-8.417, p=0.001) and adaptability scores (t=-10.735, p=0.000) in the intervention group. Moreover, proportions of family types were also improved (\u03c72 = 17.77, p=0.000). However, for the control group, no significant differences were found except for a decrease in sexual function scores (t = -4.035, p=0.000). Significant differences in change scores between groups were also found for quality of life (F=41.980, p=0.000), Sexual function (F=37.380, p=0.000), cohesion (F=15.268, p=0.000) and adaptability (F=16.998, p=0.000).","A home-based, nurse-led health promotion program improves the quality of life, sexual function and family function in postoperative patients with early-stage cervical cancer."
274,20672368,To assess the efficacy of adapted physical activity (APA) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of hospitalized children and adolescents with cancer between 9 and 18 years of age.,"A two-sequence, four-period cross-over study, Activit\u00e9s Physiques en Oncologie P\u00e9diatrique (APOP), compared hospital stay with APA sessions versus hospital stay without APA sessions on children's HRQoL. Children and parents completed the child and parent forms, respectively, of a HRQoL questionnaire, the Child Health Questionnaire, on the last day of hospitalization. We used mixed linear regression to determine the effect of treatment, of treatment order and whether response to previous treatment influenced HRQoL.","Thirty children were included (mean age 13.6 \u00b1 2.9 years; 18 males). Cross-over analysis revealed no effect of period or interaction between APA and period. HRQoL was higher when children practiced than did not practice APA during their hospitalization, as reported by both children and parents, for the dimensions physical functioning (P &lt; 0.0001), role/social-physical (P = 0.001), self-esteem (P &lt; 0.0001), and mental health (P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, APA had a significant effect on the behavior dimension (P = 0.01), as reported by children, and on the bodily pain dimension (P = 0.0004), as reported by parents. The highest significant difference in scores between with and without APA was observed for the self-esteem dimension (P &lt; 0.0001) for both children and parents.",APA during hospitalization for children with cancer was associated with better HRQoL for most of the HRQoL psychological and physical dimensions. Whether this effect is specific for children with cancer should be explored.
275,8438978,"In a work-site nutrition intervention targeting fat and fiber, we examined the intervention's effect on specific nutrients implicated in carcinogenesis, including trace metals, vitamins, and categories of fatty acids. The rationale was based on the association observed in a variety of epidemiologic studies between these nutrients and epithelial cancers.",Data were taken from eight control companies and five intervention companies that fully implemented the Treatwell intervention. Analyses of variance were used preserving the study's nested design.,"Significant intervention-related associations were observed for increased total vitamin A and carotene. Marginal intervention effects were observed for relative decreases in the percentage of calories from both saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, a relatively smaller increase in the percentage of calories from polyunsaturated fatty acids, and an increase in the consumption of vitamin B6.","Results indicate a broader effect of the intervention than on fat and fiber only. Increased intake of carotene, the single most important of these other nutrients, is plausibly related to a variety of epithelial cancers."
276,15309507,"Epidemiologic studies suggest that consumption of green tea may have a protective effect against the development of several cancers. Preclinical studies of green tea and its polyphenolic components have demonstrated antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activity, and inhibition of growth of tumor cell lines and animal tumor models, including lung cancer. Green tea may also have chemopreventive properties, and enhancement of cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents has been demonstrated. This trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of green tea extract (GTE) in patients with advanced lung cancer.","A total of 17 patients with advanced lung cancer were registered to receive once-daily oral dosing of GTE at a starting dose of 0.5 g/m2 per day, with an accelerated dose-escalation scheme.","On this schedule, the MTD of GTE was 3 g/m2 per day, and at this dose, GTE was well tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 toxicity seen. Dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhea, nausea and hypertension. No objective responses were seen in this trial. Seven patients had stable disease ranging from 4 to 16 weeks; no patient remained on therapy longer than 16 weeks due to the development of progressive disease.","This study suggests that while relatively nontoxic at a dose of 3 g/m2 per day, GTE likely has limited activity as a cytotoxic agent, and further study of GTE as a single-agent in established malignancies may not be warranted. Further studies should focus on the potential chemopreventive and chemotherapy-enhancing properties of GTE."

However, the feasibility and safety of prescribing higher volumes of physical activity to survivors of colon cancer are unknown. Furthermore, the pathways through which exercise may reduce disease recurrence are unknown.","Survivors of stage I to III colon cancer were randomized to usual-care control, 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise (low-dose), or 300 minutes per week of aerobic exercise (high-dose). Changes in soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1 prognostic biomarkers were examined.","From January 2015 to February 2016, 39 patients were enrolled (n\u00a0=\u00a013 usual-care control; n\u00a0= 14 low-dose; n\u00a0= 12 high-dose), and 38 participants completed the study (97% follow-up). Over 6 months, the low-dose group completed 142 minutes per week (92.8% adherence), and the high-dose group completed 247 minutes per week (89.0% adherence) of exercise.

No serious adverse events occurred.","Higher volumes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, up to 300 minutes per week, are feasible, safe, and elicit favorable changes in prognostic biomarkers among patients recently treated for stage I to III colon cancer. These data can be used to guide clinical recommendations for patients, and inform future trials."
278,30296472,Malnutrition in head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment is common and associated with poorer morbidity and mortality outcomes. This trial aimed to improve nutritional status during radiation therapy (RT) using a novel method of training dietitians to deliver psychological techniques to improve nutritional behaviors in patients with HNC.,"This trial used a stepped-wedge, randomized controlled design to assess the efficacy of the Eating As Treatment (EAT) program. Based on motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy, EAT was designed to be delivered by oncology dietitians and integrated into their clinical practice. During control steps, dietitians provided treatment as usual, before being trained in EAT and moving into the intervention phase. The training was principles based and sought to improve behavior-change skills rather than provide specific scripts. Patients recruited to the trial (151 controls, 156 intervention) were assessed at 4 time points (the first and the final weeks of RT, and 4 and 12\u00a0weeks afterward). The primary\u00a0outcome was nutritional status at the end of RT as measured by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment.","Patients who received the EAT intervention had significantly better scores on the primary outcome of nutritional status at the critical end-of-treatment time point (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.53 [-2.93 to -.13], P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). Intervention patients were also significantly more likely than control patients to be assessed as well-nourished at each time point, lose a smaller percentage of weight, have fewer treatment interruptions, present lower depression scores, and report a higher quality of life. Although results were not statistically significant, patients who received the intervention had fewer and shorter unplanned hospital admissions.",This trial is the first of its kind to demonstrate the effectiveness of a psychological intervention to improve nutrition in patients with HNC who are receiving RT. The intervention provides a means to ameliorate malnutrition and the important related outcomes and consequently should be incorporated into standard care for patients receiving RT for HNC.

280,28226330,Little information from prospective clinical trials is available on the influences of surgical approaches on postoperative body compositions and nutritional status. We designed a prospective non-randomized trial to compare postoperative chronological changes in body composition and nutritional status between laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy for stage I gastric cancer (GC).,"Body compositions and nutritional indicators in blood tests were measured at the baseline and at the 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th postoperative months (POM). The primary end point was the decrease relative to the baseline in the body muscle mass at POM 6.","Ninety-six patients for the laparoscopic group and 52 for the open group were eligible for data analysis. No significant differences were found in any baseline demographics, body compositions, and nutritional indicators between the groups. The changes of body muscle mass at POM 6 were similar in both groups. Overall, no significant differences between the groups were observed in any of the body composition and nutritional indicators during the first year after surgery.",Postoperative body compositions and nutritional status were not affected by surgical approaches during the first 12 months after surgery in patients who underwent distal gastrectomy for stage I GC.

Although not supported statistically, the aerobic-based exercise group reported a clinically relevant decline in number of symptoms postintervention (-1.5, 95% CI = -2.6 to -0.3), and women in both exercise groups experienced clinically meaningful improvements in lower-body endurance, aerobic fitness, and quality of life by 12-wk follow-up.","Participating in resistance- or aerobic-based exercise did not change lymphedema status but led to clinically relevant improvements in function and quality of life, with findings suggesting that neither mode is superior with respect to lymphedema effect. As such, personal preferences, survivorship concerns, and functional needs are important and relevant considerations when prescribing exercise mode to those with secondary lymphedema."
283,17762445,Fatigue is a common symptom in cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.,We conducted a double-blind randomized crossover trial of multivitamins versus placebo in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy to evaluate fatigue and quality of life.,": We randomized 40 patients to either placebo or Centrum Silver. At the middle of the radiation treatments, patients were switched from placebo to multivitamins and vice versa. Patients answered the EORTC QLQ C-30 quality of life (QOL) and Chalder fatigue questionnaires at the beginning, middle, and end of radiation therapy. Both groups experienced decreases in general (P = 0.009; P = 0.001) and physical fatigue scores (P = 0.031; P = 0.029) at the end of the course of placebo compared with the assessment prior to this treatment. We also observed significant improvements in functional (P = 0.026) and symptoms (P = 0.016) score scales of the QOL questionnaire in the patients on placebo. No significant changes were elicited with the use of multivitamins. We also observed significantly lower rates of fatigue in the patients who had just finished a course of placebo as compared with patients finishing a course of multivitamins (0 vs. 25% P = 0.035).",Multivitamins do not improve radiation-related fatigue in patients with breast cancer.
284,25927692,Anxiety experienced by women during their participation in breast cancer screening programs can condition their adherence to the program. The aim was to determine whether a brief nursing intervention could reduce anxiety before screening mammography.,"A randomized controlled trial carried out with 436 Spanish women aged between 50-69 years, who attended a population breast cancer screening program. The experimental group received an ad-hoc tailored intervention, which consisted of offering information about the screening program and the mammography exam, as well as of providing personal emotional support. Anxiety was assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Fear of screening outcome and fear of breast cancer were also assessed.","Women of the experimental group had 60% less probability of having a high anxiety state (OR = 0.40; 95%: CI [0.25, 0.65]), after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables. Regarding trait anxiety, no differences were observed between groups. The stratified analysis showed that this positive impact was greater in women who did not fear the screening outcome (OR = 0.24; 95% CI [0.11, 0.52]) or breast cancer (OR = 0.07; 95% CI [0.01, 0.41]).",A protocolized nursing intervention reduced the probability of being anxious when undergoing a screening mammography.
285,29327085,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide. With medical advances, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients often live for years with many symptoms that interfere with activities.

Patients completed measures of symptom interference and measures assessing the severity of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and anxiety.","The eligibility screening rate (64%) and high retention (83% at 8\u00a0weeks post-baseline) demonstrated feasibility. When examining within-group change, ACT participants showed decreases in symptom interference (i.e., fatigue interference and sleep-related impairment; Cohen's d range\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.23 to -\u20090.31) at 8 and 12\u00a0weeks post-baseline, whereas education/support participants showed minimal change in these outcomes (d range\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.03 to 0.07). Additionally, at 12\u00a0weeks post-baseline, ACT participants showed moderate decreases in fatigue and sleep disturbance (both ds\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.43), whereas education/support participants showed small decreases in these outcomes (ds\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.24 and -\u20090.18 for fatigue and sleep disturbance, respectively). Both the ACT and education/support groups showed reductions in depressive symptoms (ds\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.27 and -\u20090.28) at 12\u00a0weeks post-baseline. Group differences in all outcomes were not statistically significant.",ACT shows feasibility and promise in improving fatigue and sleep-related outcomes in MBC patients and warrants further investigation.
286,23748233,"Up to 50\u2009% of all cancer patients require psychosocial support during the course of their disease. However, only a proportion of these patients make use of the existing services. This is partly because patients are unaware that psychosocial support services are available to them. We investigated whether systematically providing printed information concerning psychosocial support can increase the knowledge and usage of these services, as well as health-related self-efficacy.","In a controlled trial, 108\u00a0breast cancer patients were assigned alternately to either an intervention- or a control group. At two predefined time points before and during radiotherapy, patients in the intervention group received correspondence informing them about psychosocial services (psycho-oncology, clinical social work and the Cancer Information Service).The control group received no systematic information. Using a standardized questionnaire, all patients were subsequently questioned about their knowledge of psychosocial support services, their perceived self-efficacy and their use of psychosocial support services.","We found that systematic provision of information had a positive effect on the knowledge of psychosocial support services (p\u2009=\u20090.042; d\u2009=\u20090.45) and self-efficacy (p\u2009=\u20090.047; d\u2009=\u20090.42). However, no increase in the actual usage of these services was observed (p\u2009=\u20090.661; d\u2009=\u20090.10).","The systematic provision of information in the form of written correspondence can easily be implemented into clinical routine and is an effective way to increase cancer patients' knowledge of psychosocial support services. Furthermore, providing information about the services had a positive impact on patients' perceived self-efficacy. However, simply making this information available did not increase the usage of psychosocial support services."
287,27252077,"Advanced cancer patients with disease progression develop cachexia. Nevertheless, cancer patients at nutritional risk have shown improved body weight and quality of life with oral nutritional supplements.","This was a randomized controlled trial in adult female cancer patients (n = 63) attending palliative clinics, with symptoms of cachexia.

Oral administration of CM decoction and intravenous dripping of Chinese patent medicine were given to patients in Group I. Patients in Group II received chemotherapeutic protocol alone. Patients in Group III received chemotherapeutic protocol while taking CM decoction. Twenty-eight days were taken as one therapeutic course, and two courses in total. They were observed for two treatment courses by taking Symptoms Scale of CM to Primary Lung Cancer, bone marrow depression score, and progression-free survival (PFS) as therapeutic efficacy indices. Meanwhile, the Cox's proportional hazards regression model was established to analyze the favorable factors and risk factors that influenced patients' PFS.","The CM symptom integral of Group I and Group III was superior to that before treatment, showing statistical difference (P &lt; 0.01).

289,24460069,"Physical activity during chemotherapy has been shown in several studies to reduce fatigue, improve symptoms and impact positively on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Challenges associated with intervention studies on physical activity during cancer treatment relate to consistent adherence. The primary objective was to study feasibility and adherence of physical activity intervention among patients with cancer during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. The secondary objective was to investigate the effects of physical activity on health aspects, including HRQoL, symptoms and surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease.",This randomized controlled trial included patients with breast cancer (BRCA) and colorectal cancer (CRC) during adjuvant chemotherapy. The intervention continued for 10 weeks and included daily walks of 10 000 steps and a weekly supervised group walk. Adherence was assessed by a pedometer and the number of participants who reported step counts every week and percentage of participants who achieved the target steps every week.,"Adherence average reached 91% during the intervention period; in total 74% completed the exercise intervention. The majority of the participants achieved an average of 83% of the target of 10 000 steps per day for 10 weeks. There was a significant increase in daily physical activity (p = 0.016) in the intervention group. Significant differences were also found for some breast cancer-specific symptoms [swelling, mobility and pain (p = 0.045)]. The study showed a relatively small weight gain an average of 0.9 kg in the intervention group and 1.3 kg in the control group.",Physical activity in the form of walking is feasible during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment despite increasing symptoms. The physical activity increased in the intervention group during the study time and had a positive impact on breast symptoms and the weight gain was lower in comparison to previous studies.
290,16447306,Active for Life After Cancer is a randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of a 6-month group-based lifestyle physical activity program (Lifestyle) for prostate cancer patients to improve quality of life (QOL) including physical and emotional functioning compared to a group-based Educational Support Program and a Standard Care Program (no group).,A total of 134 prostate cancer patients receiving continuous androgen-ablation were randomly assigned to one of the three study conditions.,"Results indicated no significant improvements in QOL at 6 or 12 months. Both group-based programs were positively received and yielded good attendance and retention. Lifestyle participants demonstrated significant improvements in most theoretical mediators proposed by the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory to affect physical activity. Despite these improvements, no significant changes were found for most physical activity measures.",Results suggest a lifestyle program focusing on cognitive-behavioral skills training alone is insufficient for promoting routine physical activity in these patients.

In this study, we quantify and interpret changes in global gene expression patterns in the human prostate gland before, during and after a 12 month broccoli-rich diet.","Volunteers were randomly assigned to either a broccoli-rich or a pea-rich diet. After six months there were no differences in gene expression between glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) positive and null individuals on the pea-rich diet but significant differences between GSTM1 genotypes on the broccoli-rich diet, associated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signalling pathways. Comparison of biopsies obtained pre and post intervention revealed more changes in gene expression occurred in individuals on a broccoli-rich diet than in those on a pea-rich diet. While there were changes in androgen signalling, regardless of diet, men on the broccoli diet had additional changes to mRNA processing, and TGFbeta1, EGF and insulin signalling. We also provide evidence that sulforaphane (the isothiocyanate derived from 4-methylsuphinylbutyl glucosinolate that accumulates in broccoli) chemically interacts with TGFbeta1, EGF and insulin peptides to form thioureas, and enhances TGFbeta1/Smad-mediated transcription.","These findings suggest that consuming broccoli interacts with GSTM1 genotype to result in complex changes to signalling pathways associated with inflammation and carcinogenesis in the prostate. We propose that these changes may be mediated through the chemical interaction of isothiocyanates with signalling peptides in the plasma. This study provides, for the first time, experimental evidence obtained in humans to support observational studies that diets rich in cruciferous vegetables may reduce the risk of prostate cancer and other chronic disease.",ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00535977.

Patients at baseline (N\u2009=\u2009699) and different patients at follow-up (N\u2009=\u2009650) completed questionnaires regarding CAM.,"At the 2-month follow-up, nurses in the intervention reported they were more likely to ask about CAM use than those in the control group (odds ratio, 4.2; P\u2009=\u2009.005). However, no significant effect was found for the percentage of patients who indicated that they were asked about CAM use (odds ratio, 2.1; P\u2009&gt;\u2009.10). Approximately 40% of patients reported using CAM after their cancer diagnosis, yet the majority of nurses estimated that &lt;\u200925% of their patients were using CAM.","CAM use in community-based oncology patients is common and is underestimated by oncology nurses. The brief, low-intensity intervention presented herein was found to be sufficiently powerful to change nurses' perceptions of their behavior but may not have been intensive enough to yield changes that were evident to patients."
293,11841126,"Nucare, a short-term psychoeducational coping skills training intervention was evaluated in a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) of 225 newly diagnosed breast and colon cancer patients.","Measures of psychosocial distress, well being and optimism were evaluated every four months during a one-year period. Patients were randomized to one of four arms: Nucare presented in an individual basis; Nucare presented in a group format; a non-directive supportive group; and a no-intervention control. The interventions were provided in five sessions of ninety minutes each.",Patients with breast cancer who received Nucare presented in an individual format showed more significant improvements in well-being over time compared to those in the control and group arms.,"We were unable to develop functioning groups within the RCT. Partial explanations for the latter finding include the structural limitations of the RCT: the groups were small, difficult to schedule and patients indicated that they would have preferred to choose whether or not to participate in a group. The positive changes in women with breast cancer who received Nucare persisted at 12 months."
294,15810945,Helicobacter pylori infection is a major cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. This study postulated that cranberry juice would be effective in the suppression of H. pylori in an endemically infected population at high risk for gastric cancer.,"A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Linqu County of Shandong Province, China, where 189 adults aged 48.9 +/- 11.2 years (mean +/- SD) with H. pylori infection were randomly divided into two groups: cranberry juice (n = 97) and placebo (n = 92). Participants were assigned to orally receive two 250-ml juice boxes of cranberry juice or matching placebo beverage daily for 90 days. The degree of H. pylori infection was determined using the 13C-urea breath test before randomization at 35 and 90 days of intervention to assess the efficacy of cranberry juice in alleviating infection.","A total of 189 subjects with positive 13C-urea breath test results prior to randomization completed the study. At day 35 of intervention, 14 of the 97 (14.43%) from the the cranberry juice treatment group and 5 of the 92 (5.44%) of the placebo recipients had negative 13C-urea breath test results. After 90 days, the study concluded that 14 of the 97 subjects in the cranberry juice treatment group versus 5 of the 92 in the placebo group yielded negative test results. Eleven individuals from the cranberry juice treatment group and only two from the placebo group were negative at 35 and 90 days of experiment. These results are significant (p &lt; .05).",Regular consumption of cranberry juice can suppress H. pylori infection in endemically afflicted populations.
295,28283805,"Caregivers of cancer patients face challenges impacting their physical, psychological and social well-being that need attention in the form of well-designed and tested interventions. We created an eight-session individual stress management intervention for caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) recipients. This intervention, tested by randomized control trial, proved effective in decreasing distress. Herein, we describe the intervention including theoretical framework, development, and elements of fidelity. Implementation challenges along with recommendations for refinement in future studies are discussed with the goal of replication and dissemination.","Seventy-four of 148 caregivers received stress management training following randomization. The intervention occurred during the 100-day post-transplant period when caregivers are required. The training provided integrated cognitive behavioral strategies, psychoeducation, and problem-solving skills building as well as use of a biofeedback device.","Seventy percent of caregivers completed all eight sessions indicating good acceptability for the in-person intervention; however, most caregivers did not reliably use the biofeedback device. The most common reason for drop-out was their patient becoming gravely ill or patient death. Few caregivers dropped out because of study demands. The need for flexibility in providing intervention sessions was key to retention.",Our evidence-based stress management intervention for Allo-HSCT caregivers was feasible. Variability in acceptability and challenges in implementation are discussed and suggestions for refinement of the intervention are outlined. Dissemination efforts could improve by using alternative methods for providing caregiver support such as telephone or video chat to accommodate caregivers who are unable to attend in-person sessions.
296,14521249,To test the effectiveness of a community intervention program to promote breast and cervical cancer screening.,Low-income Mexican American neighborhoods located in 2 Texas cities were assigned to intervention or comparison conditions. A 2-year community intervention was delivered via local mass media and reinforced by indigenous volunteers.,There were higher Pap smear completion rates for women under 40 years of age in the intervention community.,"Although it is important to address the cultural needs of all Mexican American women, it is also important to understand the tangible environmental barriers faced by the older women."
297,25516073,"In recent years, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates have increased steadily in the USA, though racial and ethnic disparities persist. In a community-based randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effect of patient navigation on increasing CRC screening adherence among older African Americans.","Participants in the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Demonstration were randomized to either the control group, receiving only printed educational materials (PEM), or the intervention arm where they were assigned a patient navigator in addition to PEM. Navigators assisted participants with identifying and overcoming screening barriers. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the effect of patient navigation on CRC screening adherence. Up-to-date with screening was defined as self-reported receipt of colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy in the previous 10\u00a0years or fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in the year prior to the exit interview.","Compared with controls, the intervention group was more likely to report being up-to-date with CRC screening at the exit interview (OR 1.55, 95\u00a0% CI 1.07-2.23), after adjusting for select demographics. When examining the screening modalities separately, the patient navigator increased screening for colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy (OR 1.53, 95\u00a0% CI 1.07-2.19), but not FOBT screening. Analyses of moderation revealed stronger effects of navigation among participants 65-69\u00a0years and those with an adequate health literacy level.","In a population of older African Americans adults, patient navigation was effective in increasing the likelihood of CRC screening. However, more intensive navigation may be necessary for adults over 70\u00a0years and individuals with low literacy levels."
298,23841259,To observe the clinical efficacy of yiqi jiedu quyu recipe (YJQR) combined endocrine therapy in treating advanced prostate cancer (APC).,"Totally 44 APC patients were randomly assigned to the combination group (23 cases) and the control group (21 cases). All patients received endocrine therapy for treating PC in Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Urological Diseases in China. After 6 months of treatment serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), free PSA (f-PSA), hemoglobin (Hb), Tcell subsets, natural kill (NK) cells, QLQ-C30 scale, Chinese medical symptoms score, I -PSS score, as well as the incidence of tidal fever were observed.","After treatment the PSA, f-PSA, and Hb were improved in the combination group, showing statistical difference when compared with before treatment (P &lt;0.05). Besides, better effects were obtained in the combination group (P &lt;0.05, P &lt;0.01). After treatment CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8, and NK cell levels were also improved in the combination group, showing statistical difference when compared with before treatment (P &lt;0.05). Besides, better effects were obtained in the combination group (P &lt;0.01). The quality of life (QOL), emotional function, Chinese medical symptoms score, and I -PSS symptom score were improved in the two groups (P &lt;0. 05,P &lt;0. 01). Besides, better effects in the aforesaid indices and the incidence of tidal fever were obtained in the combination group (P &lt;0.05).","YJQR combined endocrine therapy could obviously improve APC patients' QOL, reduce adverse reactions of Western medical treatment, improve the immune function, and enhance therapeutic effects of endocrine therapy."
299,12805247,This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of long-term vitamin C supplementation on serum and dietary vitamin C and identifying the factors associated with change in serum concentration.,"A total of 439 subjects with atrophic gastritis initially participated in a randomized clinical trial using vitamin C and beta-carotene to prevent gastric cancer. We originally randomized the participants into four treatment groups using a 2x2 factorial design, whereby 0 or 15 mg/day beta-carotene and 50 or 500 mg/day vitamin C were administered in a double-blind manner. The beta-carotene component was terminated early after a mean treatment duration of four months. Before and upon early termination of beta-carotene supplementation, 134 subjects dropped out this trial, while 120 and 124 subjects took the vitamin C supplement at either 50 mg or 500 mg daily for five years.","Changes in serum vitamin C were significantly higher in the high-dose group (38.5% increase, 95% CI = 27.0-49.9) than in the low-dose group (13.0% increase, 5.1-20.9) or in the dropout group (3.3% increase, -2.1-8.6) after five-year supplementation. The serum vitamin C at baseline was negatively associated with changes in serum vitamin C (p &lt; 0.0001), while high-dose (p &lt; 0.0001) and low-dose (p &lt; 0.05) supplementation and female gender (p &lt; 0.001) were positively associated. Dietary intake of vitamin C in the supplementation group was almost identical before and after five-year supplementation of vitamin C (2.31 mg/day decrease, 95% CI = -15.3-10.7), while a 17.7 mg/day decrease (95% CI = -44.2-8.86) was observed in the drop-out group.","Five-year vitamin C supplementation induces a remarkable increase in serum vitamin C concentration, and our intervention program appears to have no effect on dietary vitamin C intake."
300,25148839,"Despite mounting evidence indicating that exercise training has a positive effect on cancer recovery, the influence of cancer type on the response to exercise training remains uncharacterized. Therefore, the adaptations to exercise training were compared between groups composed of 7 different forms of cancer.","A total of 319 cancer survivors completed fatigue inventories and participated in assessments of cardiorespiratory function, which encompassed aerobic capacity (VO2 peak), pulmonary function (forced vital capacity [FVC] and forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]), and resting blood pressure and heart rate. Participants were divided into 7 groups based on cancer type, including breast cancer (BC, n = 170), prostate cancer and other male urogenital neoplasia (PC, n = 38), hematological malignancies (HM, n = 34), colorectal cancer (CC, n = 25), gynecological cancers (GC, n = 20), glandular and epithelial neoplasms (GEN, n = 20), and lung cancer (LC, n = 12). All participants completed an individualized, multimodal exercise intervention consisting of cardiorespiratory, flexibility, balance, and muscular strength training 3 days per week for 3 months. Following the intervention, all subjects were reassessed. Generalized Estimating Equations with exchangeable working correlation structure was used to model each response; the group by time interaction effect represented the effect of cancer type on exercise-associated improvements.","No significant (P &gt; .05) group by time interaction effects were observed between different types of cancer for any parameter. Pre- to postexercise contrasts revealed significant improvements in VO2 peak in BC, PC, HM, and GEN at the Bonferroni adjusted significance level (.00714). Heart rate was significantly lowered in the BC and CC groups. Mean fatigue indices decreased by at least 17% in all groups, but these changes were only significant in the BC, HM, CC, and GC groups. Systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in BC and GC, and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly only in the BC group while pulmonary function remained unchanged in all cancer types.","Although trends toward improved cardiorespiratory and fatigue parameters only reached significance in some groups, there were no significant differences between cancer types. This suggests that cardiorespiratory and fatigue improvements following rehabilitative exercise are not dependent on cancer type. Further research investigating alternative physiological parameters are needed to confirm the relationship between cancer type and exercise-mediated rehabilitation."
301,19942107,This study compares the effects of an integrated yoga program with brief supportive therapy in breast cancer outpatients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy at a cancer centre.,Eighty-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to receive yoga (n = 44) or brief supportive therapy (n = 44) prior to their radiotherapy treatment. Intervention consisted of yoga sessions lasting 60 min daily while the control group was imparted supportive therapy once in 10 days. Assessments included European Organization for Research in the Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life (EORTCQoL C30) functional scales and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Assessments were done at baseline and after 6 weeks of radiotherapy treatment.,"An intention to treat GLM repeated measures ANOVA showed significant difference across groups over time for positive affect, negative affect and emotional function and social function. There was significant improvement in positive affect (ES = 0.59, p = 0.007, 95%CI 1.25 to 7.8), emotional function (ES = 0.71, p = 0.001, 95%CI 6.45 to 25.33) and cognitive function (ES = 0.48, p = 0.03, 95%CI 1.2 to 18.5), and decrease in negative affect (ES = 0.84, p&lt;0.001, 95%CI -13.4 to -4.4) in the yoga group as compared to controls. There was a significant positive correlation between positive affect with role function, social function and global quality of life. There was a significant negative correlation between negative affect with physical function, role function, emotional function and social function.",The results suggest a possible role for yoga to improve quality of life and affect in breast cancer outpatients.
302,10479611,"Radon and cigarette smoking have a synergistic, multiplicative effect on lung cancer rates. Smokers, and perhaps nonsmoking residents, of smoking households are at increased risk for lung cancer even when radon levels are relatively low. A behavioral risk reduction strategy emphasizing smoking cessation is proposed and data are presented from pilot studies and a short-term evaluation of a randomized intervention trial.","Pilot studies, including radon testing, interviews, questionnaires, and focus groups, led to a three-arm randomized intervention trial comparing two kinds of written materials and telephone counseling. Smoking households were recruited by offering free radon test kits through an electric utility companies billing system. Three-month follow-up data were obtained by mail and phone.","Of an estimated 2,600 smoking households in the utility district, 1,220 requested a radon test kit, and 714 were randomized into three treatment conditions. Brief phone counseling (up to two short calls) significantly increased smoking quit rates, compared to written materials only, and was also related to other risk reduction behaviors (e.g., household ban on smoking).",Offering free radon testing through a public utility billing system is an effective recruitment tool for reaching households at risk due to radon-smoking synergy. Brief telephone counseling is superior to written materials in reducing smoking and encouraging indoor smoking bans. Methods are needed to better inform smokers of their additional risk from exposure to even low levels of radon.
303,21948812,It is not known if verum (real) acupuncture is effective for nausea and vomiting (emesis) during radiotherapy.,We randomly treated 215 blinded cancer patients with verum: penetrating 'deqi' creating acupuncture (n = 109) or non-penetrating sham needles (n = 106) two to three times per week. The patients documented emesis daily during the radiotherapy period. Primary end point was the number of patients with at least one episode of nausea.,"In the verum and the sham acupuncture group, 70% and 62% experienced nausea at least once during the radiotherapy period (relative risk 1.1, 95% CI 0.9-1.4) for a mean number of 10.1 and 8.7 days. Twenty five percent and 28% vomited, and 42% and 37% used antiemetic drugs at least once, respectively. Ninety-five percent in the verum acupuncture group and 96% in the sham acupuncture group believed that the treatment had been effective against nausea. In both groups, 67% experienced positive effects on relaxation, mood, sleep or pain reduction and 89% wished to receive the treatment again.","Acupuncture creating deqi is not more effective than sham in radiotherapy-induced nausea, but in this study, nearly all patients in both groups experienced that the treatment was effective for nausea."
304,19276838,"Interventions to increase physical activity among breast cancer survivors are needed to improve health and quality of life and possibly to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and early mortality. Therefore, we report the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a pilot randomized trial designed to increase physical activity in sedentary breast cancer survivors receiving hormone therapy.","Forty-one sedentary women on estrogen receptor modulators or aromatase inhibitors for stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive a 12-wk multidisciplinary physical activity behavior change intervention or usual care.","Recruitment was 34%, intervention adherence was 99%, and complete follow-up data were obtained on 93%. Most participants (93%) were white with mean age of 53 +/- 9 yr. Differences favoring the intervention group were noted for accelerometer physical activity counts (mean difference = 72,103; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 25,383-119,000; effect size (d) = 1.02; P = 0.004), aerobic fitness (mean difference = 2.9; 95% CI = -0.1 to 5.8; d = 0.64; P = 0.058), back/leg muscle strength (mean difference = 12.3; 95% CI = 0.4-15.9; d = 0.81; P = 0.017), waist-to-hip ratio (mean difference = -0.05; 95% CI = -0.01 to -0.08; d = -0.77; P = 0.018), and social well-being (mean difference = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.3-3.8; d = 0.76; P = 0.03). However, the intervention group also reported a greater increase in joint stiffness (mean difference = 1.1; 95% CI = 0.1-2.2; d = 0.70; P = 0.04).",A behavior change intervention for breast cancer survivors based on the social cognitive theory is feasible and results in potentially meaningful improvements in physical activity and selected health outcomes. Confirmation in a larger study is warranted.
305,24863090,To evaluate if a supervised exercise training program improves the quality of life (QoL) of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) patients on TSH-suppressive therapy with levothyroxine (L-T4).,"Initially, a cross-sectional study was performed to compare the QoL and the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between subclinical hyperthyroidism (SCH) patients (n = 33) and euthyroid subjects (EU; n = 49). In the prospective phase of the study, SCH patients were randomized in a non-blinded fashion to either participate (SCH-Tr = trained patients; n = 16) or not (SCH-Sed = untrained patients; n = 17) in a supervised exercise training program. The exercise program consisted of 60 minutes of aerobic and stretching exercises, twice a week, during twelve weeks. The QoL was assessed by the application of the WHOQOL-Bref, and the SF-36 was used to assess the HRQoL.","SCH patients had statistically lower scores than EU on the &quot;physical&quot; domain of WHOQOL-Bref, besides &quot;physical function&quot;, &quot;role-physical&quot;, &quot;bodily pain&quot;, &quot;general health&quot;, &quot;vitality&quot;, &quot;role-emotional&quot;, and &quot;mental-health&quot; domains of SF-36. After three months, SCH-Tr patients showed improvement in the &quot;physical&quot; and &quot;psychological&quot; domains of WHOQOL-Bref (p &lt; 0.05), and in the &quot;physical function&quot;, &quot;role-physical&quot;, &quot;bodily pain&quot;, &quot;vitality&quot; and &quot;mental health&quot; domains of SF-36.","Patients on TSH-suppressive therapy with L-T4 for DTC had impaired QoL and HRQoL compared to EU, but it was improved after 3-months of an exercise training program. Exercise seems to play an important role in the follow-up of DTC patients, since it seems to minimize the adverse effects of the treatment on QoL and HRQoL."
306,23334562,Many cancer patients experience persistent fatigue after the completion of chemotherapy. A previous single-arm study provided evidence for an effect of acupuncture in this population. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether acupuncture reduces post-chemotherapy chronic fatigue more effectively than sham acupuncture.,"Cancer patients reporting significant fatigue persisting for at least 2\u00a0months following the completion of chemotherapy were randomized to receive once weekly true or sham acupuncture for 6\u00a0weeks. Fatigue was evaluated before and after treatment using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI, the primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-General (FACT-G) scores.","One hundred one patients were randomized with 74 (34 true acupuncture; 40 sham control) evaluated for the primary endpoint. BFI scores fell by about one point between baseline and follow-up in both groups with no statistically significant difference between groups. HADS and FACT-G scores also improved in both groups, but there was no significant difference between groups. Patients in the sham acupuncture group crossed over to receive true acupuncture in week 7. No long-term reduction of fatigue scores was observed at the 6-month evaluation.",True acupuncture as provided in this study did not reduce post-chemotherapy chronic fatigue more than did sham acupuncture. The study is limited by the number of patients lost to follow-up. We also cannot exclude the possibility that a more intensive treatment regimen may be more effective.
307,25746777,This study aimed to provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of an early minimal cognitive-behavioural therapy for acute insomnia (mCBT-I) comorbid with cancer.,"Thirty-eight patients (92% female; Mage 57; all Caucasian) with various types of cancer and having insomnia symptoms for less than 6 months were randomized to a self-administered mCBT-I condition (n=20; 6 short booklets\u00a0+\u00a03 phone consultations with a psychologist, over 6 weeks) or a no-treatment condition (n=18). Measures were completed at pre-treatment and post-treatment, as well as at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.","All sleep parameters and the average dosage of hypnotics were significantly improved from pre- to post-treatment among treated participants, but not in control participants. mCBT-I was also associated with a significantly greater reduction of anxiety and depression symptoms, maladaptive sleep habits, and erroneous beliefs about sleep, as well as with a significantly greater improvement of subjective cognitive functioning. A greater proportion of mCBT-I participants than controls met the criteria for a clinical remission at post-treatment. Therapeutic gains of mCBT-I were well sustained up to 6 months after the intervention.",This study supports the efficacy of an early minimal CBT-I to treat acute insomnia comorbid with cancer.
308,15916993,"It is widely accepted that disease prevention efforts should consider cultural factors when addressing the needs of diverse populations, yet there is surprisingly little evidence that doing so enhances effectiveness. The Institute of Medicine has called for randomized studies directly comparing approaches that do and do not consider culture.","In a randomized trial, 1227 lower-income African-American women from 10 urban public health centers were assigned to either a usual care control group, or to receive a series of six women's health magazines with content tailored to each individual. By random assignment, these magazines were generated from either behavioral construct tailoring (BCT), culturally relevant tailoring (CRT) or both (BCT + CRT). The CRT magazines were based on four cultural constructs: religiosity, collectivism, racial pride, and time orientation. All tailored magazines sent to women ages 40-65 promoted use of mammography; magazines sent to women ages 18-39 promoted fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Analyses examined changes from baseline to 18-month follow-up in use of mammography and servings of FV consumed daily.","Women receiving BCT + CRT magazines were more likely than those in the BCT, CRT, and control groups to report getting a mammogram (76% vs. 65% vs. 64% vs. 55%, respectively), and had greater increases in FV servings consumed daily (+0.96 vs. + 0.43 vs. + 0.25 vs. + 0.59).",Systematically integrating culture into tailored cancer prevention and control interventions may enhance their effectiveness in diverse populations.

Telephone counselling targets included increased intakes of vegetables (particularly cruciferous vegetables and tomato products), whole grains, and beans/legumes. Dietary intakes and plasma carotenoid levels were assessed at baseline and at after 6 months.","In the intervention arm the mean daily intakes of total vegetables, crucifers and tomato products increased by 71%, 180% and 265%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05); in the control arm there were no significant changes in mean intakes of these components. Similarly, in the intervention arm, mean plasma levels of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene and total carotenoids increased by 37%, 32%, 23%, 30% and 25%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05); in the control arm there were no significant changes in plasma levels of these components. There were no significant changes in either group in whole grain, beans/legumes, or fat intake.",Telephone-based dietary counselling increases vegetable intake and plasma concentrations of potentially anticarcinogenic carotenoids in men with prostate cancer on active surveillance. These data support the feasibility of implementing clinical trials of diet-based interventions in this population.
310,16025260,To investigate whether increased contact with the patient's general practitioner (GP) soon after cancer treatment can increase patient quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with follow-up.,"A randomised controlled study with 91 patients from one Norwegian municipality. The intervention group got a 30-min invited consultation with the patient's GP and an invitation to further GP follow-up. Quality of life and patient satisfaction with diagnosis, treatment and overall care were measured with validated instruments.","Relatives' satisfaction with care increased over 6 months in the intervention group (P = 0.018), but otherwise, there was no difference between the intervention and control groups concerning QoL, satisfaction with care or number of consultations. Patient satisfaction with care showed a tendency to increase when treatment intent was curative. Some functional QoL measures and satisfaction tended to increase during the first 6 months after treatment. Free text comments suggested that some patients appreciated the contact with their GP.","Some cancer patients benefit from follow-up by their GP. The way to perform this kind of follow-up in primary care, and who these cancer patients are, should be further studied. Short follow-up time and an urban setting may have contributed to the lack of group differences in our study, but patients treated for cancer may have limited need for follow-up as long as they feel well and the situation remains stable."
311,17893379,We wanted to assess the effectiveness of intensive education for physicians compared with a traditional session on communicating with breast cancer patients.,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted in practices in London, Hamilton, and Toronto, Canada, with 17 family physicians, 16 surgeons, and 18 oncologists, and with 102 patients of the surgeons and oncologists. Doctors were randomized to 1 of 2 continuing education approaches: a traditional 2-hour version (control group), or a new 6-hour intensive version including exploring the patients' perspectives and reviewing videotapes and receiving feedback (intervention group). Communication behavior of the physicians was measured objectively both before and after the intervention. As well, 4 postintervention patient outcomes were measured, by design only for surgeons and oncologists: patient-centerdness of the visit, satisfaction, psychological distress, and feeling better.","No significant differences were found on the communication score of the intervention vs the control physicians when controlling for preintervention communication scores. Intervention family physicians, however, had significantly higher communication subscores than control family physicians. Also, patients of the intervention surgeons and oncologists were significantly more satisfied (scores of 82.06 vs 77.78, P = .03) and felt better (88.2% vs 70.6%, P=.02) than patients of the control surgeons and oncologists when controlling for covariates and adjusting for clustering within doctor.",The continuing medical education intervention was effective in terms of some but not all physician and patient outcomes.

313,23430007,"Side effects of head and neck radiotherapy are common and can interfere with treatment. However, scientific information on a patient's understanding of these complications is scarce and confusing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of an educational video on improving the understanding of head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy about treatment complications.","A 6-min video about head and neck radiotherapy side effects was produced by a multidisciplinary oncology team. A controlled clinical study was performed with two groups: the control group (N = 19), which received verbal information, and the video group (N = 19), which received verbal information and watched the video. Two questionnaires were given to both groups, one before the beginning of radiotherapy and the other after finishing radiotherapy.","Thirty-eight patients were included in the study (mean age of 59.7 years in the video group and 57.9 in the control group). Thirty-one patients had an education level less than high school education. All patients of the video group answered correctly why they were undergoing radiotherapy. On the other hand, three patients of the control group did not know the reason for the treatment. More patients of the video group demonstrated better knowledge about radiotherapy side effects than patients of the control group. Only one patient of the video group had doubts about the treatment, compared to seven of the control group.",The present study showed that an educational video may improve patient understanding of head and neck radiotherapy and its side effects despite their education level.
314,15800330,"To evaluate the effectiveness of a supervised home-based flexible training program on cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), mental distress, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) parameters in young and middle-aged cancer patients shortly after curative chemotherapy.","One hundred eleven patients age 18 to 50 years who had received chemotherapy for lymphomas or breast, gynecologic, or testicular cancer completed the trial. These patients were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n = 59), which underwent a 14-week training program, or a control group (n = 52) that received standard care. Primary outcome was change in CRF, as determined by Astrand-Rhyming indirect bicycle ergometer test (maximum oxygen uptake [VO(2max)]), between baseline (T0) and follow-up (T1). Secondary outcomes were mental distress, as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and HRQOL, as assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire. Two-way analysis of covariance was used to analyze changes from T0 to T1.",VO(2max) increased by 6.4 mL/kg(-1)/min(-1) in patients in the intervention group and by 3.1 mL/kg(-1)/min(-1) in patients in the control group (P &lt; .01). The fatigue score decreased by 17.0 points in the control group compared with only 5.8 points in the intervention group (P &lt; .01). There were no intergroup differences in mental distress or HRQOL.,"A supervised, home-based, flexible training program has significant effect on CRF in young and middle-aged cancer patients shortly after curative chemotherapy, but it has no favorable effect on patients' experience of fatigue, mental distress, or HRQOL."
315,22906948,This study evaluates the effect of acupuncture on hot flashes and disturbed night sleep in patients treated for breast cancer. The effect of acupuncture was tested against a sham-acupuncture group and a no-treatment control group. Plasma estradiol was measured to rule out this as cause of effect. Side effects of the treatment were registered.,"We randomized 94 women into the study: 31 had acupuncture, 29 had sham acupuncture and 34 had no treatment.","In the acupuncture group, 16 patients (52%) experienced a significant effect on hot flashes compared with seven patients (24%) in the sham group (p &lt; 0.05). The effect came after the second acupuncture session and lasted for at least 12 weeks after last treatment. A statistically significant positive effect was seen on sleep in the acupuncture group compared with the sham-acupuncture and no-treatment groups. The effect was not correlated with increased levels of plasma estradiol. No side effects of acupuncture were registered.",We find that acupuncture significantly relieves hot flashes and sleep disturbances and is a good and safe treatment in women treated for breast cancer.
316,11938806,"To evaluate the effect of supplementary moxibustion in treating III, IV a stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with radio- and chemotherapy.","Fifty-six cases of NPC were randomly divided into two groups, 28 in each group. They were treated with radiotherapy in routine or chemotherapy adopting AD protocol. Salt-separated moxibustion on Shenque (Ren 8) point was given to the treated group from beginning of radio- and chemotherapy for 30 times as one therapeutic course.","The remission rate in the two groups after radio- and chemotherapy was not different significantly. The toxic and side-effect occurrence was less in the treated group than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The 5-year local control rates of NPC and cervical lymphnode were 85.7% and 85.0% in the treated group, which were higher than those in the control group (78.6% and 78.9%). The 5-year survival rate in the two groups were 50.0% and 35.7% respectively. After radio- and chemotherapy, the blood content of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), middle molecular substance and sulfhydryl reduced the SOD activity ascended in the treated group, the difference was significant as compared with those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01).",The supplementary moxibustion on Shenque point could obviously reduce the toxic side-effect of advanced NPC patients treated with radio- and chemotherapy.
317,17921245,Novel mobile phone technology linked to a server that communicates patients' symptoms to healthcare professionals has been adapted to register the side- effects of chemotherapy and provide advice on management of toxicity. We report a feasibility study to examine the utility of home monitoring of patients' symptoms via a mobile phone.,"Six colon cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, entered symptom data onto user friendly screens on a mobile phone twice daily. This 'real time' self assessment of nausea, vomiting, mucositis, diarrhoea and hand-foot syndrome and measurement of temperature was sent via a secured connection to a remote computer. In the event of moderate or severe symptoms (generating amber and red alerts respectively), the nurse was immediately alerted by the computer, via a pager. The nurse then contacted the patient to reinforce the automatic advice sent to the patient on their phone and to assess the patient using clinical algorithms.",The patient used the mobile phones during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. The data were successfully analysed by the server software and alerts were generated alerting the study nurses to patients' symptoms at the appropriate time. There were 91 alerts-54 red and 37 amber; 54% (29/54) of the red alerts were data delay and transmission problems which were swiftly rectified. The remaining red alerts were managed appropriately by the study nurses. Both patients and staff felt confident in this approach to symptom management.,This study demonstrates that the technology for monitoring patients' symptoms worked well. The patients felt secure in the knowledge that their symptoms were being closely monitored and that they were participating effectively in their own care management.
318,19283791,"Reduced bone mineral density (BMD), altered body composition, impaired motor performance and passive ankle dorsiflexion are side effects of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. We performed a randomized study investigating whether an exercise program could prevent these side effects.","At diagnosis we randomized 51 ALL patients (median age: 5.4 years) into a group receiving a 2-year exercise program or a control group receiving standard care. BMD of total body (BMD(TB)), lumbar spine (BMD(LS)) and body composition were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, motor performance with Bayley Scales of Infant Development or Movement-ABC, and passive ankle dorsiflexion with a goniometer. The investigator was blinded to the randomization.","Body fat increased equally during treatment in both groups. One year after cessation of therapy more rapid decline of excessive body fat was observed in the intervention group than in the controls (P = 0.01). Lean body mass, BMD(TB) and BMD(LS) of both groups decreased equally during treatment and increased equally thereafter. Both groups showed a similar decrease in passive ankle dorsiflexion and motor performance during treatment. Adherence to the intervention program varied considerably. Adherence to intervention: 11% of children exercised daily, 37% &gt; once a week, 16% once weekly, 36% &lt; once a week.","The exercise program was not more beneficial than standard care in preventing reduction in BMD, motor performance and passive ankle dorsiflexion than standard care, most likely due to unsatisfactory compliance. Increased BMI and body fat in the intervention group normalized faster after cessation of chemotherapy."

320,22241101,"The initial breast cancer genetic counseling visit is mainly educational, with large amounts of relatively standard information and little counselee participation. Counselors might provide more counselee-specific information if counselees would participate more. A pre-visit website providing computer-tailored information and a question prompt sheet (QPS) might help counselees to pursue a more active role.","Counselees were randomized to receive usual care (UC) or UC plus the pre-visit website. The QPS questions were sent to the counselor before the visit. All counselees completed a baseline questionnaire, and visits were videotaped.","Intervention-group counselees (n = 102) did not ask more questions than UC-group counselees (n = 90). However, counselees in the intervention group more often shared their agenda (B = 10.37; confidence interval (CI) 2.68-18.06; P = 0.01), directed the communication (B = 0.41; CI 0.28-0.53; P = 0.01), and paraphrased the counselors' words (B = 5.18; CI 0.43-9.92; P = 0.03). Counselors introduced and answered the QPS questions. As a result, they provided more information about the topics of these questions, and the information provided was more specific to whether there was an indication for DNA testing.","A pre-visit website with QPS helped counselees to communicate more assertively. As a result, the information provided was more counselee specific, without affecting the visit duration."
321,12915605,"Although there is wide recognition of the usefulness of improving physicians' communication skills, no studies have yet assessed the efficacy of post-training consolidation workshops. This study aims to assess the efficacy of six 3-hour consolidation workshops conducted after a 2.5-day basic training program.","Physicians, after attending the basic training program, were randomly assigned to consolidation workshops or to a waiting list. Training efficacy was assessed through simulated and actual patient interviews that were audiotaped at baseline and after consolidation workshops for the consolidation-workshop group, and approximately 5 months after the end of basic training for the waiting-list group. Communication skills were assessed according to the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop Evaluation Manual. Patients' perceptions of communication skills improvement were assessed using a 14-item questionnaire.","Sixty-three physicians completed the training program.

322,29116467,"27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), drives the growth of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)D), the active metabolite of vitamin D, is known to inhibit expression of CYP27B1, which is very similar in structure and function to CYP27A1, the synthesizing enzyme of 27HC. Therefore, we hypothesized that 1,25(OH)D may also inhibit expression of CYP27A1, thereby reducing 27HC concentrations in the blood and tissues that express CYP27A1, including breast cancer tissue.","27HC, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), and 1,25(OH)D were measured in sera from 29 breast cancer patients before and after supplementation with low-dose (400\u00a0IU/day) or high-dose (10,000\u00a0IU/day) vitamin D in the interval between biopsy and surgery.","A significant increase (p\u00a0=\u00a04.3E-5) in 25OHD and a decrease (p\u00a0=\u00a01.7E-1) in 27HC was observed in high-dose versus low-dose vitamin D subjects. Excluding two statistical outliers, 25OHD and 27HC levels were inversely correlated (p\u00a0=\u00a07.0E-3).","Vitamin D supplementation can decrease circulating 27HC of breast cancer patients, likely by CYP27A1 inhibition. This suggests a new and additional modality by which vitamin D can inhibit ER+ breast cancer growth, though a larger study is needed for verification."
323,21751295,"The generalizability of palliative care intervention research is often limited by high rates of study attrition. This study examined factors associated with attrition from a randomized controlled trial comparing meaning-centered group psychotherapy (MCGP), an intervention designed to help advanced cancer patients sustain or enhance their sense of meaning to the supportive group psychotherapy (SGP), a standardized support group.","Patients with advanced solid tumor cancers (n\u2009=\u2009153) were randomized to eight sessions of either the MCGP or SGP. They completed assessments of psychosocial, spiritual, and physical well-being pretreatment, midtreatment, and 2\u2009months post-treatment. Attrition was assessed in terms of the percent of participants who failed to complete these assessments, and demographic, psychiatric, medical, and study-related correlates of attrition were examined for the participants in each of these categories.","The rates of attrition at these time points were 28.1%, 17.7%, and 11.1%, respectively; 43.1% of the participants (66 of 153) completed the entire study. The most common reason for dropout was patients feeling too ill. Attrition rates did not vary significantly between study arms. The participants who dropped out pretreatment reported less financial concerns than post-treatment dropouts, and the participants who dropped out of the study midtreatment had poorer physical health than treatment completers. There were no other significant associations between attrition and any demographic, medical, psychiatric, or study-related variables.","These findings highlight the challenge of maintaining advanced cancer patients in longitudinal research and suggest the need to consider alternative approaches (e.g., telemedicine) for patients who might benefit from group interventions but are too ill to travel."
324,15351581,To determine the effects of diets rich in soy and linseed compared with a control diet on biochemical markers of prostate cancer in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.,"Twenty-nine men diagnosed with prostate cancer and scheduled to undergo a radical prostatectomy were randomized to one of three groups: soy (high phytoestrogen), soy and linseed (high phytoestrogen), or wheat (low phytoestrogen). A bread was specially manufactured to incorporate 50 g of heat-treated (HT) soy grits or 50 g of HT soy grits and 20 g of linseed as part of the study participant's daily diet. Baseline and preoperative levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free androgen index, and dihydrotestosterone were measured.","Statistically significant differences were detected between the HT soy grits group and the control wheat group for the percentage of change in total PSA (-12.7% versus 40%, P = 0.02) and the percentage of change in free/total PSA ratio (27.4% versus -15.6%, P = 0.01); and between the HT soy grits group and the HT soy grits and linseed group for the percentage of change in free androgen index (16.4% versus -15.5%, P = 0.04) and the percentage of change in free/total PSA ratio (27.4% versus -10%, P = 0.007).",The data from this study indicate that a daily diet containing four slices of a bread rich in HT soy grits favorably influences the PSA level and the free/total PSA ratio in patients with prostate cancer. This work provides some evidence to support epidemiologic studies claiming that male populations who consume high phytoestrogen diets have a reduced risk of prostate cancer development and progression.
325,19114222,This study compares the anxiolytic effects of a yoga program and supportive therapy in breast cancer outpatients undergoing conventional treatment at a cancer centre.,"Ninety-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to receive yoga (n=45) or brief supportive therapy (n=53) prior to their primary treatment i.e., surgery. Only those subjects who received surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and six cycles of chemotherapy were chosen for analysis following intervention (yoga, n=18, control, n=20). Intervention consisted of yoga sessions lasting 60min daily while the control group was imparted supportive therapy during their hospital visits as a part of routine care. Assessments included Speilberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory and symptom checklist. Assessments were done at baseline, after surgery, before, during, and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy.",A GLM-repeated measures ANOVA showed overall decrease in both self-reported state anxiety (p&lt;0.001) and trait anxiety (p=0.005) in yoga group as compared to controls. There was a positive correlation between anxiety states and traits with symptom severity and distress during conventional treatment intervals.,The results suggest that yoga can be used for managing treatment-related symptoms and anxiety in breast cancer outpatients.
326,12599221,"Women with breast carcinoma commonly experience psychologic distress following their diagnosis. Women who participate in breast cancer support groups have reported significant reduction in their psychologic distress and pain and improvement in the quality of their lives. Web-based breast cancer social support groups are widely used, but little is known of their effectiveness. Preliminary evidence suggests that women benefit from their participation in web-based support groups.","Seventy-two women with primary breast carcinoma were assigned randomly to a 12-week, web-based, social support group (Bosom Buddies). The group was semistructured, moderated by a health care professional, and delivered in an asynchronous newsgroup format.","The results indicate that a web-based support group can be useful in reducing depression and cancer-related trauma, as well as perceived stress, among women with primary breast carcinoma. The effect sizes ranged from 0.38 to 0.54. Participants perceived a variety of benefits and high satisfaction from their participation in the intervention","This study demonstrated that the web-based program, Bosom Buddies, was effective in reducing participants' scores on depression, perceived stress, and cancer-related trauma measures. The effect size of the intervention was in the moderate range. Although web-based social support groups offer many advantages, this delivery mechanism presents a number of ethical issues that need to be addressed."
327,22384550,To study the therapeutic effect of Weiyan serial recipes (WYSR) in treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) accompanied with intestinal metaplasia (IM) and/or dysplasia (Dys) and to explore its molecular mechanisms for reversing the gastric precancerous lesions.,"One hundred and fifty patients with confirmed diagnosis of CAG accompanied with IM and/or mild Dys were randomly assigned to the treatment group (120 cases) and the control group (30 cases). Patients in the treatment group were respectively treated with WYSR I-IV according to Chinese medicine syndrome typing as incoordination of Gan and Wei syndrome (32 cases), deficiency of Pi and Wei syndrome (35 cases), insufficient Wei-yin syndrome (28 cases), and stasis stagnation in Wei-channel syndrome (25 cases). Patients in the control group orally took Weifuchun Pill. The therapeutic course for all was 3 months, and totally 2 courses. The clinical effects, changes under the gastroscope, the pathological changes, and expressions of gastric mucosal hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha(HIF-1alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein were compared between the two groups before and after treatment.","The total effective rate of the treatment group was 86.7% and the total effective rate of the gastroscopic changes was 78.3%, which was higher than those of the control group (56.7% and 40.0%), showing significant difference (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05). The total effective rate of clinical symptoms and that of the pathological changes were higher in the treatment group than in the control group with statistical significance shown (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistical difference in the expressions of HIF-1alpha and VEGF protein of the control group between before and after treatment (P &gt; 0.05). Compared with before treatment, the post-treatment expressions of HIF-1alpha and VEGF protein both obviously decreased in the treatment group (P &lt; 0.01), and were lower than those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05).","WYSR showed better effects on treating gastric precancerous lesions. It could significantly improve the atrophy, IM, and Dys, and promote the reversal of gastric precancerous lesions. Its mechanisms might possibly be correlated with inhibiting the over-expressions of HIF-1alpha and VEGF protein."
328,16215875,Early menarche is a risk factor for breast cancer. Since body composition influences age at menarche we decided to estimate the effects of a school-based intervention for the prevention of obesity on the initiation of menses in young girls.,Ten schools were randomized to a modified curriculum or no curricular changes for 2 school-years. Data of 508 pre-menarcheal girls at baseline (age range: 10-13 years) were analyzed.,"Girls attending an intervention school experienced menarche less frequently than girls attending control schools during the intervention period (intervention schools = 54%, control schools = 59%; RR = 0.76; 95% CI [0.66, 0.87]). Attending an intervention school was also associated with lower increase in BMI (-0.3 kg/m2; p = 0.003), lower gains in triceps skinfold thickness (-1.5 mm; p = 0.007), decreased television viewing (-0.6 h/day; p&lt;0.0001) and increased physical activity (3.1 MET-h/week; p = 0.032). Including these changes as predictors of menarche incidence attenuated the intervention effect (RR = 0.94; 95% CI [0.80, 1.10]).","The intervention delayed menarche in this group of girls. The delay was produced by increased physical activity, reduced television viewing and changes in BMI and fat distribution. These findings may have implications for the primary prevention of breast cancer."
329,29893482,Subcutaneous port needle insertions are painful and distressing for children with cancer. The interactive MEDiPORT robot has been programmed to implement psychological strategies to decrease pain and distress during this procedure. This study assessed the feasibility of a future MEDiPORT trial. The secondary aim was to determine the preliminary effectiveness of MEDiPORT in reducing child pain and distress during subcutaneous port accesses.,"This 5-month pilot randomized controlled trial used a web-based service to randomize 4- to 9-year-olds with cancer to the MEDiPORT cognitive-behavioral arm (robot using evidence-based cognitive-behavioral interventions) or active distraction arm (robot dancing and singing) while a nurse conducted a needle insertion. We assessed accrual and retention; technical difficulties; outcome measure completion by children, parents, and nurses; time taken to complete the study and clinical procedure; and child-, parent-, and nurse-rated acceptability. Descriptive analyses, with exploratory inferential testing of child pain and distress data, were used to address study aims.","Forty children were randomized across study arms. Most (85%) eligible children participated and no children withdrew. Technical difficulties were more common in the cognitive-behavioral arm. Completion times for the study and needle insertion were acceptable and &gt;96% of outcome measure items were completed. Overall, MEDiPORT and the study were acceptable to participants. There was no difference in pain between arms, but distress during the procedure was less pronounced in the active distraction arm.",The MEDiPORT study appears feasible to implement as an adequately-powered effectiveness-assessing trial following modifications to the intervention and study protocol.

330,26142337,To investigate the adjuvant therapeutic effects of fermented red ginseng (FRG) extract on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with chemotherapy.,"A total of 60 patients with advanced NSCLC were divided into two groups using a random number table, i.e., the gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) chemotherapy alone group (26 patients) and the FRG + GP chemotherapy group (34 patients), for 60-day treatment. Patients were then assessed according to the Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Chinese medicine symptoms score, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung. In addition, chemotherapy toxicity and tumor biomarkers were measured.","For NSCLC patients after chemotherapy, FRG extract significantly improved the FSI score, CM symptoms score, psychological status, physical conditions, and quality of life and reduced chemotherapy toxicity, but the expression levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin-19 fragments, and neuron-specific enolase were not significantly different between the chemotherapy alone and the FRG + chemotherapy groups or between pre- and post-treatments.",This study demonstrated that FRG extract had an adjuvant effect on advanced NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy. Further studies with a larger sample size will verify the current findings.
331,21577030,"Since physical exercise programs have the potential to help cancer patients regain physical fitness and may exert a range of positive consequences for recovery and psychological well-being, the impact of a physical exercise program was investigated in this prospective study.","Women with primary nonmetastatic breast cancer after a minimum 4-week period post chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy completion were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: intervention group (IG) (n = 30) and waiting group (WG) (n = 28). The 10-week twice weekly exercise group program consisted of gymnastics, movement games, relaxation, walking, and jogging. Anxiety, depression, body image, and quality of life were measured using standardized questionnaires. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max/kg) was assessed as a measure of physical fitness.","Patients in the IG improved significantly over time with regard to anxiety (p = 0.03, d = 0.45), depression (p = 0.05, d = 0.43), individual body image (p = 0.006, d = 0.44), and VO(2)max/kg (p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.50), whereas no improvements were observed in the WG. However, this randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate significant intervention effects in quality of life and social body image.","This prospective study provided evidence for the effectiveness of a 10-week physical exercise intervention to significantly improve psychosocial wellbeing, individual body image, and physical fitness."
332,20142594,To evaluate the impact of a CD-ROM intervention in the education of patients with suspected Lynch syndrome (LS) about microsatellite instability (MSI) and immunohisochemistry (IHC) testing.,"Two hundred thirteen patients meeting Bethesda criteria were randomly assigned to receive either a brief educational session with a health educator (n = 105) or a brief educational session plus a CD-ROM (n = 108). Assessments were administered at baseline and 2 weeks post-treatment. Primary outcomes included MSI and IHC knowledge and level of satisfaction with and completeness of the preparation to make the decision for MSI testing. Secondary outcomes included decisional conflict, difficulty making the decision, cancer-specific and global anxiety, and level of discussion about MSI testing with family and friends.","Participants in the education plus CD-ROM condition reported significant increases in knowledge about the MSI and IHC tests, greater satisfaction with the preparation to make a decision for testing, lower decisional conflict, and greater decisional self-efficacy. The effects of the education plus CD-ROM on most outcomes were not moderated by preintervention levels of exposure to MSI testing, family support for MSI testing, or the family history of cancer.","Incorporation of new media education strategies for individuals at risk for LS may be a valuable component of the informed consent process. As clinical criteria for MSI and IHC testing continue to expand, the need for alternative educational approaches to meet this increased demand could be met by the self-administered computer-based strategy that we described."
333,17627004,A change in diet is known to affect micronutrient levels in blood but to what extent diet can affect micronutrient levels in the breast is not yet well established.,"Healthy, premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer were randomized across four diet arms for 1 year in a 2 x 2 factorial design study: control, low-fat, high fruit-vegetable, and combination low-fat/high fruit-vegetable diets. Subjects were asked to collect breast nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) at 0, 6, and 12 months, and levels of micronutrients were measured in the fluid.","A total of 122 women were enrolled, 97 were retained for 12 months, and sufficient NAF for analysis was available from 59 women at baseline, 49 at 6 months, and 50 at 12 months. Repeated measures mixed-model ANOVA was used to model the data using cholesterol levels and lactation duration as covariates, where appropriate. The high fruit-vegetable intervention, regardless of fat intake, significantly increased total carotenoid levels in NAF. In the low-fat arm, levels of total carotenoids decreased over time relative to control. Levels of total tocopherols and retinol did not change significantly. Levels of 15-F(2t)-isoprostane, a marker of lipid peroxidation, also did not change significantly over time, although there was a decrease observed in the combination arm.","These results indicate that total carotenoid levels in NAF can be significantly increased in the breast NAF with a high fruit-vegetable diet. A low-fat diet that was achieved with little increase in fruit and vegetable intake, however, decreased NAF carotenoid levels."
334,25181937,"Short-term physical activity (PA) has beneficial effects on symptom management and quality of life, however, longer-term adherence is likely needed for improved disease outcomes in breast cancer survivors (BCS). This study examined the effects of a supervised group exercise program on motivational outcomes and PA among BCS at 5-year follow-up.","The original study was a two-armed, randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-week supervised group exercise program to usual care among 203 BCS. BCS for this follow-up study were contacted at 60 months postintervention and asked to complete assessments of motivational outcomes from the Theory of Planned Behavior and PA behavior using the Scottish Physical Activity Questionnaire.","Overall, 87 participants provided 5-year follow-up data with no differences in participation by group.

Small positive effects were also noted for perceived behavioral control (d = +0.18), instrumental attitude (d = +0.26), and injunctive norm (d = +0.35), although they were not statistically significant. Moreover, BCS who were more active at 5-year follow-up also reported more favorable perceived behavioral control (d = +0.16), instrumental attitude (d = +0.28), injunctive norm (d = +0.24), and descriptive norm (d = +0.31), although these differences were not statistically significant.",This trial provides suggestive evidence that a supervised exercise program has positive effects on motivational outcomes even after 5 years. Additional intervention strategies during follow-up may further improve long-term adherence and health outcomes in BCS.

The experimental group received a case management program and telephone follow-up sessions; the control group received routine care. Patients were assessed at three time points: first visit to the otolaryngology clinic for biopsy examination (T0), and then at 2 weeks (T1) and 4 weeks (T2) after the biopsy examination.","Patients in both groups had significantly higher levels of knowledge about oral cancer, preventive behavior for oral cancer, and lower level of uncertainty at T2 compared to T0. At T2, participants in the experimental group had significantly greater knowledge about oral cancer, more preventive behavior for oral cancer, and less uncertainty compared to those in the control group.","The case management program with telephone counseling effectively improved knowledge about oral cancer, preventive behavior for oral cancer, and uncertainty levels in patients with oral precancerous lesions in the four weeks after receiving a biopsy examination. The case management program can be applied with positive results to patients receiving different types of cancer screening, including colorectal, breast, and cervical screening."
336,18602144,"Previous research has demonstrated that patients with prostate cancer participating in the Prostate Cancer Lifestyle Trial had a reduction in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, inhibition of LNCaP cell growth, and fewer prostate cancer-related clinical events at the end of 1 year compared with controls. The aim of this study was to examine the clinical events in this trial during a 2-year period.","The Prostate Cancer Lifestyle Trial was a 1-year randomized controlled clinical trial of 93 patients with early-stage prostate cancer (Gleason score &lt;7, PSA 4-10 ng/mL) undergoing active surveillance. The patients in the experimental arm were encouraged to adopt a low-fat, plant-based diet, to exercise and practice stress management, and to attend group support sessions. The control patients received the usual care.","By 2 years of follow-up, 13 of 49 (27%) control patients and 2 of 43 (5%) experimental patients had undergone conventional prostate cancer treatment (radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or androgen deprivation, P &lt; .05). No differences were found between the groups in other clinical events (eg, cardiac), and no deaths occurred. Three of the treated control patients but none of the treated experimental patients had a PSA level of &gt;or=10 ng/mL, and 1 treated control patient but no treated experimental patients had a PSA velocity of &gt;2 ng/mL/y before treatment. No significant differences were found between the untreated experimental and untreated control patients in PSA change or velocity at the end of 2 years.",Patients with early-stage prostate cancer choosing active surveillance might be able to avoid or delay conventional treatment for at least 2 years by making changes in their diet and lifestyle.
337,12083630,"Videotaped education materials to teach breast self-examination (BSE) are used worldwide. However, evaluation of videotaped BSE instructions is lacking.","Premenopausal women (mean age 33.4+/-11.2 years) without history of breast cancer were approached to participate in this experimental study and randomly assigned to a video intervention group (VG; n = 130: length of the video = 15 min) or non-video comparison group (NVG; n = 121). All participants answered a questionnaire on BSE behavior and health beliefs. No additional training was given. The total duration of the session including completion of the questionnaire was 15 min for the NVG and 30 min for the VG. Three months later, changes in BSE behavior were compared in the two groups. The influence of health beliefs on actual BSE behavior was investigated as well.","Women of both the VG and NVG performed BSE significantly more frequently at follow-up than at baseline. Analysis of covariance, using the baseline BSE-frequency as co-variate and the follow-up BSE frequency as the dependent variable, revealed that women in the VG (adjusted mean = 7.9 times per year, 95%CI = 6.5-9.4) performed BSE more frequently than women of the NVG (adjusted mean = 6.1 times per year, 95%CI = 4.6-7.5) (F = 4.2, df= 2, p = 0.02). Among motivational predictors, having an example of a role model (modeling) was shown by regression analysis to explain the greatest amount of variance (13%) in BSE frequency.",Use of an educational videotape increased the frequency of BSE among premenopausal women.
338,23065023,"Patients who undergo polypectomy are at increased risk of adenoma recurrence. The preventive potential of vitamins (A, C and E) and selenium supplementation represent an interesting opportunity for colorectal cancer prevention.","To assess the efficacy of a combination of these micronutrients in reducing the incidence of recurrent adenomas in subjects on post-polypectomy endoscopic follow-up, a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial was started in Italy in 1988. A total of 411 patients were randomized to receive either an active compound (200 \u03bcg selenium, 30 mg zinc, 2 mg vitamin A, 180 mg vitamin C, 30 mg vitamin E) or a placebo daily for 5 years. Of them, 330 had follow-up colonoscopy (164 in the intervention and 166 in the placebo group).","After a median follow-up of 4 years (range 1-15 years), 100 patients had recurrence: 38 in the intervention and 62 in the placebo arm. The 15-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 48.3% in the intervention and 64.5% in the placebo arm (HR = 0.59; log-rank P = 0.009). A 39% reduction of the risk of recurrence was observed in the intervention compared to the placebo group (adjusted HR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.41-0.92): the risk reduction was similar for small tubular (adjusted HR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.37-0.99) and advanced adenomas (adjusted HR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.24-1.01).",Our study showed a statistically significant effect of antioxidant supplementation on adenoma recurrence. Further clinical trials are needed to address the role of antioxidants in subgroups of subjects at increased risk for colorectal cancer.
339,14767751,Our aim was to explore whether vitamin A has protective effect on high-dose-methotrexate (HDMTX)-induced intestinal D-xylose malabsorption in children with leukemia and lymphoma.,"We performed a prospective randomized un-blinded study of vitamin A in 35 children with leukemia and lymphoma who were planned to receive HDMTX 3 g/m(2) and 5 g/m(2), respectively. Twenty-two patients (group 1) received a single dose of 180,000 IU a day before HDMTX was given, and 13 (group 2) received only HDMTX. The vitamin A group received the vitamin only once. Oral D-xylose absorption tests before and 7 days after HDMTX were carried out to evaluate intestinal absorption. Retinol-binding protein (RBP) levels prior to therapy were also measured for vitamin A status.","Although we observed no difference of HDMTX-induced toxicity, including hematological, dermatological, systemic, and other toxicities, between groups, the D-xylose absorption test was significantly better in-group 1 ( p=0.030). Absorption was decreased in five of 22 patients (23%) who received vitamin A comparing to eight of 13 (62%) who received only HDMTX ( p=0.033). RBP levels were lower than normal in 13 of 22 patients in-group 1 and nine of 13 in group 2. In patients whose RBP levels were lower than normal, HDMTX-induced toxicity was lower in the group 1 than group 2 but not statistically significant. No sign of vitamin A toxicity was observed throughout the study.",The administration of vitamin A before HDMTX may protect against drug-induced D-xylose malabsorption in children with cancer. Further studies are apparently needed to clarify the full benefits of vitamin A in preventing HDMTX-induced mucosal damage.
340,26360934,"Caregiving can negatively impact well-being. Cancer caregivers face unique challenges given the intense nature of cancer and treatment, which increases their risk for burden, poor quality of life (QOL), and burnout. Studies to reduce caregiver burden demonstrate QOL improvement and distress reduction in the short term. However, few studies exist to address long-term benefits. We assessed changes in various QOL domains after participation in a QOL intervention for caregivers of patients having newly diagnosed advanced cancer.","Our institutional review board-approved study randomized patient-caregiver dyads to either usual care or an in-person group intervention composed of six 90-min sessions of structured multidisciplinary QOL components delivered over 4\u00a0weeks, with 10 follow-up phone calls within 20\u00a0weeks. Caregivers attended four of the six sessions attended by patients. Sessions included physical therapy, coping and communication strategies, mental health education, spirituality, and social needs. Caregiver QOL (Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer Scale [CQOLC] and Linear Analogue Self-Assessment [LASA]) and mood (Profile of Mood States-Brief [POMS-B]) were measured at baseline and 4, 27, and 52\u00a0weeks. Wilcoxon tests and effect sizes were used to compare the caregiver groups.","Of the 131 caregivers (65 intervention and 66 usual care), 116 completed the study. Caregivers post-intervention (at 4\u00a0weeks) had improved scores on LASA Spiritual Well-being; POMS-B total score, Vigor/Activity, and Fatigue/Inertia; and CQOLC Adaptation. At long term (at 27\u00a0weeks), caregivers retained improvement in POMS-B Fatigue/Inertia and gained improvements in CQOLC Disruptiveness and Financial Concerns.","Caregivers who received the intervention had higher QOL ratings for specific QOL domains but not for overall QOL.

Hepatic function, T-cell subgroup and NK cell were examined, and quality of life (QOL) was evaluated with scoring by Karnofsky performance status (KPS), Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Special Scale for lung cancer (EORTC LC13) issued by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer.",The effects on all the above-mentioned indexes in the treated group were better than those in the control group after 42 days of treatment (P &lt;0.05).,YGD could not only reduce the side and toxic effects caused by NP protocol of chemotherapy in NSCLC patients but also improve their QOL.
344,24460280,To determine whether the Health Partner Program is effective in training long-term cancer survivors to be health coaches.,"We randomly assigned cancer survivors who were selected through a rigorous screening process to either the Health Partner Program or the waiting-list control group. The program consisted of 8 weeks of training in health management, leadership, and coaching. At baseline, 8, and 16 weeks, we measured primary outcomes using the Seven Habit Profile (SHP), the Korean Leadership Coaching Competency Inventory (KCCI), Ed Diner's Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Posttraumatic Growth inventory (PTGI) and secondary outcomes using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) short form 36-item questionnaire (SF- 36).","We recruited 70 subjects and randomly assigned 34 to the intervention group. The Sharpen the Saw habit of the SHP increased significantly more in intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.049), as did most PTGI factors. The intervention group also showed a significantly greater enhancement of vitality (p = 0.015) and mental health (p = 0.049) SF-36 scores but no improvement in KCCI, SWLS, HADS, or IES-R scores. The intervention group also showed a greater clinically meaningful improvement in the &quot;Think Win-Win&quot; of SHP (p = 0.043) and in the personal strength score (p = 0.025) and total score (p = 0.015) of the PTGI.",Long-term cancer survivors can benefit from the Health Partner Program to become health coaches.
345,21538098,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of age (\u2264 65 years or &gt;65 years) and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT, presence or absence) as factors that may predict changes in body composition and fitness following a 24-week exercise program in prostate cancer patients.","One hundred twenty-one men were randomly allocated to either: (1) aerobic exercise (AE), (2) resistance exercise (RE), or (3) usual care (UC). Body composition was assessed by DXA. Aerobic fitness was assessed through a maximal treadmill test. Muscular strength was assessed by leg extension and bench press using the eight-repetition maximum test. Responses were compared between younger (\u2264 65 years) and older (&gt; 65 years) patients with or without ADT.","There did not appear to be an interaction between age and ADT on body composition or fitness, nor were there any significant changes in body composition for participants \u2264 65 years.

347,7958682,Fish oil supplementation can reduce cytokinetic anomalies in the flat rectal mucosa of patients with sporadic colorectal adenoma. This study attempted to identify an optimum dose for fish oil supplementation and evaluate the persistence of its effects during long-term administration.,"In a double-blind study, 60 patients with sporadic adenomas received 2.5, 5.1, or 7.7 g of fish oil per day or placebo for 30 days. [3H]thymidine autoradiographic labeling indices were calculated in flat rectal mucosal biopsy specimens collected before and after supplementation. In a subsequent study, 15 patients with polyps received 2.5 g of fish oil per day. Proliferative parameters, mucosal fatty acids, and mucosal and plasma alpha-tocopherol levels were evaluated before, during, and after 6 months of supplementation.","Mean proliferative indices and mucosal arachidonic acid levels decreased significantly (and to similar degrees) in all treated groups, whereas mucosal eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid levels increased. Significantly reduced proliferation was observed only in patients with abnormal baseline patterns. These effects persisted during long-term, low-dose treatment. A transient reduction in mucosal (but not plasma) alpha-tocopherol levels was observed after 1 month of treatment. Side effects were insignificant.",Low-dose fish oil supplementation has short-term and long-term normalizing effects on the abnormal rectal proliferation patterns associated with increased colon cancer risk.

Consenting patients (N = 271) with a preliminary diagnosis of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, liver/gallbladder, pancreas, or colon/rectum were stratified by sex and randomly assigned to a control group that received standard care as provided on the surgical wards, or to an experimental group that received formal psychotherapeutic support in addition to routine care during the hospital stay. From June 2003 to December 2003, the 10-year follow-up was conducted. Survival status for all patients was determined from our own records and from three external sources: the Hamburg cancer registry, family doctors, and the general citizen registration offices.","Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated better survival for the experimental group than the control group. The unadjusted significance level for group differences was P = .0006 for survival to 10 years. Cox regression models that took TNM staging or the residual tumor classification and tumor site into account also found significant differences at 10 years. Secondary analyses found that differences in favor of the experimental group occurred in patients with stomach, pancreatic, primary liver, or colorectal cancer.","The results of this study indicate that patients with gastrointestinal cancer, who undergo surgery for stomach, pancreatic, primary liver, or colorectal cancer, benefit from a formal program of psychotherapeutic support during the inpatient hospital stay in terms of long-term survival."

The intervention consisted of a low-fat, vegan diet, exercise, and stress management. Participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Status Survey (a measure of mental and physical HR-QOL), the Perceived Stress Scale, the Sexual Function subscale of the University of California, Los Angeles, Prostate Cancer Index, and measures of lifestyle behaviors (to yield an overall lifestyle index) at baseline and 12 months. The data were analyzed using analysis of variance for repeated measures. The relationship between lifestyle and QOL was also analyzed using multiple linear regression analyses.","Intervention participants had significantly improved their lifestyle compared with controls at 12 months. The quality-of-life scores were high across groups and time points. However, a healthier lifestyle was related to better QOL at baseline. Participants in both groups who reported a healthier lifestyle also reported better mental and physical HR-QOL and sexual function. Furthermore, participants whose lifestyle improved over time showed enhanced physical HR-QOL and decreased perceived stress.","Men who choose active surveillance for early-stage prostate cancer are able to make comprehensive lifestyle changes. Although the average QOL was already high in this sample, individuals who improved their lifestyle enhanced their QOL further."

353,15533488,"To evaluate, in a feasibility study, the adherence to a low-fat diet by men with prostate cancer. Evidence is growing that a low-fat diet affects the development and course of prostate cancer. To design preventive and therapeutic interventions, it is important to know whether men will adhere to these nutritional recommendations, particularly when motivated by the diagnosis of prostate cancer.","Men with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels, most of whom were recently treated for prostate cancer, were randomized to one of four dietary regimens for which they received nutritional counseling: a low-fat diet (15% fat or less) with supplements (vitamin E and selenium), a low-fat diet (15% fat or less) without the supplements, the supplements alone, and a control group. Adherence was evaluated by the change in weight, fat intake, free fatty acids, cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides during a 12-month period.","The mean age of the 48 participants was 66 years. For those counseled about a low-fat diet, the mean change in the percentage of energy (kilocalories) in the diet from fat was greater after 3 months (-8.6% versus +2.1%, P &lt;0.001) and 12 months (-9.8% versus -1.6%, P = 0.001). Three months after starting the intervention, those randomized to low-fat dietary counseling had lost 2 kg, on average, compared with 0.8 kg lost by those who did not receive this counseling (P = 0.09). At 12 months, those receiving low-fat counseling had lost 2.8 kg, on average, compared with 0.5 kg gained among the other groups (P = 0.02).","With appropriate counseling, men with prostate cancer can adhere to a low-fat dietary intervention for a 12-month period."

From randomization to the end of posttrial follow-up, no differences were found between the glargine and standard care groups in myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death (1,185 vs. 1,165 events; hazard ratio 1.01 [95% CI 0.94-1.10]; P = 0.72); myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure (1,958 vs. 1,910 events; 1.03 [0.97-1.10]; P = 0.38); or any cancer (524 vs. 529 events; 0.99 [0.88-1.12]; P = 0.91) or between omega-3 and placebo groups in cardiovascular death (688 vs. 700; 0.98 [0.88-1.09]; P = 0.68) or other outcomes.","During &gt;6 years of treatment followed by &gt;2.5 years of observation, insulin glargine had neutral effects on health outcomes and salutary effects on metabolic control, whereas omega-3 fatty acid supplementation had no effect."
357,26961741,"Physical exercises offer a variety of health benefits to cancer survivors during and post-treatment. However, exercise-based pre-habilitation is not well reported in major uro-oncology surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, the adherence, and the efficacy of a short-term physical pre-habilitation program to patients with invasive bladder cancer awaiting radical cystectomy (RC).","A parent prospective randomized controlled clinical trial investigated efficacy of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on length of stay following RC. A total of 107 patients were included in the intension-to-treat population revealing 50 patients in the intervention group and 57 patients in the standard group. Pre-operatively, the intervention group was instructed to a standardized exercise program consisting of both muscle strength exercises and endurance training. The number of training sessions and exercise repetitions was patient-reported. Feasibility was expressed as adherence to the program and efficacy as the differences in muscle power within and between treatment groups at time for surgery.","A total of 66\u00a0% (95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 51; 78) adhered more than 75\u00a0% of the recommended progressive standardized exercise program. In the intervention group, a significant improvement in muscle power of 18\u00a0% (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.002) was found at time for surgery. Moreover, muscle power was significantly improved compared to that in the standard group with 0.3\u00a0W/kg (95\u00a0% CI 0.08; 0.5\u00a0%) (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.006). Adherence was not associated with pre-operative BMI, nutritional risk, comorbidity, pain, gender, or age.","In patients awaiting RC, a short-term exercise-based pre-habilitation intervention is feasible and effective and should be considered in future survivorship strategies."
358,23704198,"Sedentary behavior and impaired cardiovascular reserve capacity are common late effects of cancer therapy emphasizing the need for effective strategies to increase physical activity (PA) in cancer survivors. We examined the efficacy of a 12-month exercise-based rehabilitation program on self-reported PA, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak), strength, and patient-reported outcomes.","Two hundred fourteen post-treatment cancer survivors were randomly assigned to a 12-month rehabilitation program consisting of individual (x3) and group-based (x6) counseling in combination with once weekly high-intensity group-based exercise training (the Copenhagen Physical Activity after Cancer Treatment, PACT; n = 108) or to a health evaluation program (HE, n = 106). Study outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.","After 12 months, the percentage of patients reporting meeting PA goal behavior (\u22653 h/week) was significantly increased in the PACT group versus the HE group (70.4% versus 43.4%, P = 0.001). Repeated measures analyses indicated a statistically significant improvement in VO2peak (l min(-1)) in favour of PACT (treatment effect ratio = 1.04; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.07; P = 0.032). Significant between group differences were also observed for strength (P &lt; 0.001), depression (P = 0.020) and mental health (P = 0.040).",A 12-month exercise-based rehabilitation program is an effective strategy to promote PA and improve VO2peak in cancer survivors.
359,17244100,"Minority patients with cancer experience worse control of their pain than do their white counterparts. This disparity may, in part, reflect more miscommunication between minority patients and their physicians. Therefore, we examined whether patient coaching could reduce disparities in pain control in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.","Sixty-seven English-speaking adult cancer outpatients, including 15 minorities, with moderate pain over the prior 2 weeks were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 34) or control group (N = 33). Experimental patients received a 20-minute individualized education and coaching session to increase knowledge of pain self-management, to redress personal misconceptions about pain treatment, and to rehearse an individually scripted patient-physician dialog about pain control. The control group received standardized information on controlling pain. Data on average pain (0-10 scale) were collected at enrollment and 2-week follow-up.","At enrollment, minority patients had significantly more pain than their white counterparts (6.0 vs 5.0, P = 0.05). At follow-up, minorities in the control group continued to have more pain (6.4 vs 4.7, P = 0.01), whereas in the experimental group, disparities were eliminated (4.0 vs 4.3, P = 0.71). The effect of the intervention on reducing disparities was significant (P = 0.04).",Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and to explore possible mechanisms.
360,29189967,Better coordination of supportive services during the early phases of cancer care has been proposed to improve the care experience of patients. We conducted a randomized trial to test a community-based nurse-led coordination of care intervention in cancer patients.,"Surgical practices were cluster randomized to a control group involving usual care practices or a standardized nursing intervention consisting of an in-person supportive care assessment with ongoing support to meet identified needs, including linkage to community services. Newly diagnosed breast and colorectal cancer patients within 7\u00a0days of cancer surgery were eligible. The primary outcome was the patient-reported outcome (PRO) of continuity of care (CCCQ) measured at 3\u00a0weeks. Secondary outcomes included unmet supportive care needs (SCNS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), health resource utilization, and level of uncertainty with care trajectory (MUIS) at 3 and/or 8\u00a0weeks.","A total of 121 breast and 72 colorectal patients were randomized through 28 surgical practices. There was a small improvement in the informational domain of continuity of care (difference 0.29 p\u2009=\u20090.05) and a trend to less emergency room use (15.8 vs 7.1%) (p\u2009=\u20090.07). There were no significant differences between groups on unmet need, quality of life, or uncertainty.",We did not find substantial gaps in the PROs measured immediately following surgery for breast and colorectal cancer patients. The results of this study support a more targeted approach based on need and inform future research focused on improving navigation during the initial phases of cancer treatment.

361,25081694,Breast cancer is the most common female malignancy in the world. Beta glucan can be a hematopoietic and an immune modulator agent in cancer patients. The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of beta glucan on white blood cell counts and serum levels of IL-4 and IL-12 in women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.,"This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 30 women with breast carcinoma aged 28-65 years. The eligible participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=15) or placebo (n=15) groups using a block randomization procedure with matching based on age, course of chemotherapy and menopause status. Patients in the intervention group received two 10-mg capsules of soluble 1-3, 1-6, D-beta glucan daily and the control group receiving placebo during 21 days, the interval between two courses of chemotherapy. White blood cells, neuthrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts as well as serum levels of IL-4 and IL-12 were measured at baseline and at the end of the study as primary outcomes of the study.","In both groups white blood cell counts decreased after 21 days of the intervention, however in the beta glucan group, WBC was less decreased non significantly than the placebo group. At the end of the study, the change in the serum level of IL-4 in the beta glucan group in comparison with the placebo group was statistically significant (p=0.001). The serum level of IL-12 in the beta glucan group statistically increased (p=0.03) and comparison between two groups at the end of the study was significant after adjusting for baseline values and covariates (p=0.007).","The findings suggest that beta glucan can be useful as a complementary or adjuvant therapy and immunomodulary agent in breast cancer patients in combination with cancer therapies, but further studies are needed for confirmation."
362,8279616,"Outdoor workers are at high risk of developing skin cancer. Primary prevention in this group can potentially reduce the incidence of skin cancer, and also potentiates the spontaneous remission of existing solar keratoses. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate a solar protection intervention targeting outdoor workers.","Outdoor workers were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 65) or control group (n = 77). The intervention group received individual skin screening by a dermatologist and participated in an education session. Pre- and posttest outcome measures included solar protection behavior (assessed using a validated diary), knowledge, and attitudes.","There was a significant increase (16%) in the percentage of outdoor workers who were using a high level of solar protection at posttest compared to pretest in the intervention group, but there was no change in the control group. Although both groups improved in their knowledge score, the intervention group showed a significantly greater improvement at posttest. No changes in attitudes were detected.",The findings suggest that changes in solar protection are achievable with outdoor workers.
363,24804802,"Few studies to date have used the cancer diagnosis as a teachable moment to promote healthy behavior changes in survivors of cancer and their family members. Given the role of obesity in the primary and tertiary prevention of breast cancer, the authors explored the feasibility of a mother-daughter weight loss intervention.","A randomized controlled trial of a mailed weight loss intervention was undertaken among 68 mother-daughter dyads (n = 136), each comprised of a survivor of breast cancer (AJCC stage 0-III) and her adult biological daughter. All women had body mass indices \u2265 25 kg/m(2) and underwent in-person assessments at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, with accelerometry and exercise capacity performed on a subset of individuals. All women received a personalized workbook and 6 newsletters over a 1-year period that promoted weight loss; exercise; and a nutrient-rich, low-energy density diet. A total of 25 dyads received individually tailored instruction (individual), 25 dyads received team-tailored instruction (TEAM), and 18 dyads received standardized brochures (control).","The trial met its accrual target, experienced 90% retention, and caused no serious adverse events. Significant differences in baseline to 12-month changes were observed between individual versus control mothers for body mass index, weight, and waist circumference (WC); significant differences also were observed in the WC of corresponding daughters (P &lt;\u2009.05). Significant differences were found between individual versus control and team versus control dyads for WC (P =\u2009.0002 and .018, respectively), minutes per week of physical activity (P =\u2009.031 and .036, respectively), and exercise capacity (P =\u2009.047 for both).","Significant improvements in lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes are possible with tailored print interventions directed toward survivors of cancer and their family members. For greater impact, more research is needed to expand this work beyond the mother-daughter dyad."
364,24183730,We previously reported high rates of urinary incontinence among gynecologic cancer survivors and aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a simple intervention for treatment of urinary incontinence in this population.,"We recruited 40 gynecologic cancer survivors who reported urinary incontinence on a validated questionnaire. Women were randomized to either pelvic floor muscle training/behavioral therapy (treatment group) or usual care (control group). The primary outcome measure, assessed at 12 weeks post intervention, was a 40% difference in the validated Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) score. Fisher's exact test was used to identify differences between groups for frequency data; two-sample t-test was conducted for continuous measurements.","Mean age of this cohort was 57 (range: 37-79). The majority of the survivors had uterine cancer (60%), 18% had received radiation therapy, 95% had received surgical therapy, and 35% had received chemotherapy. At three months, 80% of the treatment and 40% of the control group reported that their urinary incontinence was &quot;much better&quot; or &quot;very much better&quot; as evaluated by the Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale (p=0.02). Brink's scores were significantly improved in the treatment group as compared to those of the controls (p&lt;0.0001). Treatment group adherence was high; the treatment group performed exercises with an average of 22 days/month.","Urinary incontinence negatively affects quality of life, and despite a high prevalence among gynecologic cancer survivors, it is often under-assessed and undertreated. We found a simple intervention that included pelvic floor muscle training and behavioral therapy, which significantly improved cancer survivor's urinary incontinence."
365,10488974,"The Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Lung Cancer Chemoprevention Trial (CARET) ended prematurely due to the unexpected findings that the active treatment group on the combination of 30 mg beta-carotene and 25,000 IU retinyl palmitate had a 46% increased lung cancer mortality and a 26% increased cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo. This study was designed when the CARET intervention was halted to evaluate the effects of long-term supplementation with beta-carotene and retinol on serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, in an attempt to explore possible explanations for the CARET result.","Serum triglyceride levels, and total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were determined in a subgroup of 52 CARET participants. Baseline and mid-trial levels were available on 23 participants on placebo and 29 on active treatment who were then serially followed for 10 months after trial termination.","Triglyceride, and total, HDL and LDL cholesterol levels were similar in the two groups at baseline. After a mean of 5 years on the intervention there was a small nonsignificant increase in serum triglyceride levels in the active group, but no difference in total, HDL, or LDL cholesterol levels. After stopping the intervention there was a decrease in triglyceride levels in the active intervention group, and no change in the other parameters.","Based on a small convenience sample, CARET participants in the active treatment arm had a small nonsignificant increase in serum triglyceride levels while on the intervention, and a decrease in serum triglyceride levels after the intervention was discontinued. No significant changes in total or HDL cholesterol were noted. These results argue against a major contribution of treatment-induced changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein levels to the increased cardiovascular mortality in the active treatment group."
366,27615542,"Quality of life in survivors of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) can be compromised by chronic diseases including increased risk of second cancers, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Overweight or obesity further increases these risks. Steroids are a component of chemotherapy for ALL, and weight gain is a common side effect. To impact behaviors associated with weight gain, we conducted a randomized nutrition counseling intervention in ALL patients on treatment.","ALL patients on a steroid-based treatment regimen at the MD Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital were recruited and randomized into control or intervention groups. The control group received standard care and nutrition education materials. The intervention group received monthly one-on-one nutrition counseling sessions, consisting of a baseline and 12 follow-up visits. Anthropometrics, dietary intake (3-day 24-hr dietary recalls) and oxidative stress measures were collected at baseline, 6 months, and postintervention. Dietary recall data were analyzed using the Nutrition Data System for Research.","Twenty-two patients (median age 11.5 years), all in the maintenance phase of treatment, were recruited. The intervention group (n = 12) reported significantly lower calorie intake from baseline to 12-month follow-up and significant changes in glutamic acid and selenium intake (P &lt; 0.05). Waist circumference was significantly associated with calorie, vitamin E, glutamic acid, and selenium intake.","A year-long dietary intervention was effective at reducing caloric intake in pediatric ALL patients receiving steroid-based chemotherapy, indicating that this is a modality that can be built upon for obesity prevention and management."
367,12035205,"Although researchers suggest treatments that provide patients with an active coping strategy may increase patients' sense of self-efficacy, previous studies have not measured patients' self-efficacy.","Eighteen women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer were randomized to efficacy-enhancing experimental (n = 10) and usual-care control (n = 8) groups.

368,24344222,"The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effect of a Web-based, self-report assessment and educational intervention on symptom distress during cancer therapy.","A total of 752 ambulatory adult participants were randomly assigned to symptom/quality-of-life (SxQOL) screening at four time points (control) versus screening, targeted education, communication coaching, and the opportunity to track/graph SxQOL over time (intervention). A summary of the participant-reported data was delivered to clinicians at each time point in both groups. All participants used the assessment before a new therapeutic regimen, at 3 to 6 weeks and 6 to 8 weeks later, completing the final assessment at the end of therapy. Change in Symptom Distress Scale-15 (SDS-15) score from pretreatment to end of study was compared using analysis of covariance and regression analysis adjusting for selected variables.","We detected a significant difference between study groups in mean SDS-15 score change from baseline to end of study: 1.27 (standard deviation [SD], 6.7) in the control group (higher distress) versus -0.04 (SD, 5.8) in the intervention group (lower distress). SDS-15 score was reduced by an estimated 1.21 (95% CI, 0.23 to 2.20; P = .02) in the intervention group. Baseline SDS-15 score (P &lt; .001) and clinical service (P = .01) were predictive.

369,15908654,"An efficient approach to education and counseling before BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing is necessary for effective utilization of testing in the community. Education and counseling, when delivered individually, are limited by a shortage of trained health care providers as well as by financial and time constraints. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pretest education and counseling for breast cancer genetics in a group setting is equivalent to that provided on an individual basis.","One hundred forty-two patients at high risk for harboring a BRCA mutation were randomly assigned to group or individual education and counseling sessions. Group education was followed by brief individual counseling. Knowledge and Impact of Events Scales (IES) were administered at baseline and after education and counseling and at 1 week and 3, 6, and 12 months. Satisfaction with education and counseling was measured at completion of the session. Preferred method of education and counseling was solicited at 3 months.","There was no difference in knowledge or IES scores between groups. When stratified by genetic test results, knowledge scores showed no difference. Regardless of group, post-test IES scores in patients with positive results were higher than patients with negative or uninformative results but returned to baseline by 12 months. Participants were equally satisfied with either method they were assigned. Significantly more time was spent per patient in individual sessions (1.25 hours) than in group education (0.74 hours).",Our data suggest that group education and counseling may confer similar benefits compared with traditional individual sessions. Additional investigation of this approach in larger numbers of patients is warranted.

Presurgery distress was measured using visual analog scales (VAS) and the short version of the Profile of Mood States (SV-POMS). Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and chi2 procedures.","Groups did not differ in terms of the following: demographics (age, education, ethnicity, marital status, all P's &gt; 0.28); medical variables (presurgery diagnosis, previous excisional biopsy, previous breast cancer, all P's &gt; 0.11); or preintervention distress (SV-POMS P &gt; 0.74) assessed on the day of surgery. Postintervention, and before surgery, patients in the hypnosis group had significantly lower mean values for presurgery VAS emotional upset (16.5 vs 38.2, P &lt; 0.0001, d = .85), VAS depressed mood (6.6 vs 19.9, P &lt; 0.02, d = .67), and SV-POMS anxiety (10.0 vs 5.0, P &lt; 0.0001, d = 0.85); and significantly higher levels for VAS relaxation (75.7 vs 54.2, P &lt; 0.001, d = -0.76) than attention controls.",The study results indicate that a brief presurgery hypnosis intervention can be an effective means of controlling presurgical distress in women awaiting diagnostic breast cancer surgery.
377,23841261,To observe the short-term efficacy and radiotherapy induced acute reactions of sarcandra glabra (SG) combined chemoradiotherapy for treating patients with local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"Totally 100 nasopharyngeal carcinoma phase III - IVa patients were randomly assigned to the control group and the observation group, 50 patients in each group. All patients received chemoradiotherapy. Patients in the observation group took SG decoction at the daily dose of 20 g.","Totally 98 patients completed the treatment. There was no statistical difference in the complete remission rate, the partial remission rate, 1-year and 2-year total survival rates, or disease free progression rate between the two groups. The occurrence rate of II - III degree radioactive oral mucositis and dry mouth were obviously lower in the observation group than in the control group, showing statistical difference (P &lt;0.05).",SG combined chemoradiotherapy could attenuate radiotherapy induced acute adverse reactions in treating advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
378,25956910,Academic detailing (AD; also known as educational visiting) facilitates the translation of evidence into practice and has been widely adopted internationally to facilitate practice change. The potential of AD linked to a specific patient and delivered by a specialist physician to general practitioners has not been evaluated. This pilot study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of AD on the knowledge and confidence of GPs caring for people with advanced cancer who had breathlessness at the end of life.,"In this randomised controlled pilot, 35 patient/GP dyads were randomised to AD or usual care. Key messages included: ensuring reversible causes were optimally treated; non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments were considered; and oxygen considered for hypoxaemic patients.","Acceptability: The majority of GPs randomised to AD agreed to participate, reporting benefits to practice. The majority of GPs in the control group requested a copy of academic detailing written materials at study completion. Feasibility: AD visits to GPs' offices could be timetabled reasonably easily, with 24 detailing visits occurring. Self-reported knowledge and beliefs: Ninety two percent of GPs reported the topics covered in the AD sessions were useful, with 83% reporting an increase in knowledge and confidence. AD sessions resulted in 58% of GPs reporting a change in their approach to the management of breathlessness. By contrast, 81% of the usual care group reported low confidence in the management and knowledge of breathlessness.",AD was acceptable and feasible to participating GPs. This pilot supports proceeding to a fully powered study.
379,20038728,"Vasomotor symptoms are common adverse effects of antiestrogen hormone treatment in conventional breast cancer care. Hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated in patients with breast cancer. Venlafaxine (Effexor), the therapy of choice for these symptoms, has numerous adverse effects. Recent studies suggest acupuncture may be effective in reducing vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women. This randomized controlled trial tested whether acupuncture reduces vasomotor symptoms and produces fewer adverse effects than venlafaxine.",Fifty patients were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of acupuncture (n = 25) or venlafaxine (n = 25) treatment. Health outcomes were measured for up to 1 year post-treatment.,"Both groups exhibited significant decreases in hot flashes, depressive symptoms, and other quality-of-life symptoms, including significant improvements in mental health from pre- to post-treatment. These changes were similar in both groups, indicating that acupuncture was as effective as venlafaxine. By 2 weeks post-treatment, the venlafaxine group experienced significant increases in hot flashes, whereas hot flashes in the acupuncture group remained at low levels. The venlafaxine group experienced 18 incidences of adverse effects (eg, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, anxiety), whereas the acupuncture group experienced no negative adverse effects. Acupuncture had the additional benefit of increased sex drive in some women, and most reported an improvement in their energy, clarity of thought, and sense of well-being.","Acupuncture appears to be equivalent to drug therapy in these patients. It is a safe, effective and durable treatment for vasomotor symptoms secondary to long-term antiestrogen hormone use in patients with breast cancer."
380,11464117,To find out whether the combination of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and ondansetron had an increased antiemetic effect.,"Fourteen testis and 11 bladder cancer patients were scheduled for 4 cycles of bleomycin-etoposide-cisplatin (BEP) or methotrexate-vinblastine-etoposide-cisplatin (MVEC) combination chemotherapy, respectively. At each cycle the whole cisplatin dose was given in 1 day that is 100 mg/m(2)/day in the BEP and 70 mg/m(2)/day in the MVEC protocols. Ondansetron was given at a dose of 12 mg/day and TENS was applied by commercially available 'Relief Band'(Maven Labs, Inc., Citrus Heights, Calif., USA). The first 3 cycles of each case were blindly randomized to one of the following regimens; TENS vs. ondansetron vs. a combination of both. The regimens were applied during the administration of cisplatin and the patients were asked to report their nausea according to a scale between 0 to 10. Also for each regimen the number of emetic attacks experienced during the administration of cisplatin was recorded by the same observer. Then the scores of each regimen were compared.","The mean nausea scores for regimens TENS, ondansetron and TENS + ondansetron were found to be 5.12 +/- 2.54, 3.0 +/- 1.71 and 0.8 +/- 0.96, respectively. Ondansetron was better than TENS in preventing nausea (p = 0.000). However the combination of TENS and ondansetron resulted in a significant decrease in nausea scores when compared to TENS alone (p = 0.000) or ondansetron alone (p = 0.000). The mean number of emetic attacks for the TENS, ondansetron and TENS + ondansetron regimens were 3.16 +/- 1.84, 1.64 +/- 1.44 and 0.56 +/- 0.82, respectively. A statistically significant difference was present between the number of emetic attacks observed with the TENS + ondansetron combination and TENS alone (p = 0.000) or ondansetron alone (p = 0.001). Ondansetron was again better than TENS in preventing emetic attacks (p = 0.001).",The use of TENS as an adjunct to ondansetron therapy has provided significant benefit in preventing nausea and emetic attacks caused by cisplatin.
381,12960113,"The effects of a low-fat diet or a low-fat diet with the addition of a soy supplement were investigated in a pilot Phase II study for asymptomatic, hormonally naive prostate cancer patients with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.","A two-step intervention was implemented. During step 1 patients were begun on a low-fat diet with a goal to reduce fat intake to 15% of total daily calories. On PSA progression, a soy protein supplement was added to the diet (step 2). The primary end point was PSA reduction by 50%. Secondary end points were PSA doubling time and time to progression (TTP). Serum was analyzed for changes in the sex hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) axes.","Among 18 evaluable patients, (median follow-up on study 10.5 months), no patient on either step had a PSA reduction by 50% at any time. There was a trend toward a longer PSA doubling time (P = 0.06) and a prolongation in estimated median TTP of approximately 3 months (P = 0.018) during step 2 compared with step 1 of the study. During step 1, free testosterone levels decreased by 5% (P &lt; 0.01), and during step 2, IGF-I levels increased by 22% (P = 0.02).",A low-fat diet with the subsequent addition of a soy supplement did not result in a significant decline in PSA levels. The addition of soy protein had a modest effect on TTP. A potentially undesirable effect associated with the administration of soy was an increase in IGF-I serum levels.
382,17785708,"Breast cancer chemotherapy may cause unfavorable changes in physical functioning, body composition, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life (QOL). We evaluated the relative merits of aerobic and resistance exercise in blunting these effects.","We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial in Canada between 2003 and 2005 that randomly assigned 242 breast cancer patients initiating adjuvant chemotherapy to usual care (n = 82), supervised resistance exercise (n = 82), or supervised aerobic exercise (n = 78) for the duration of their chemotherapy (median, 17 weeks; 95% CI, 9 to 24 weeks). Our primary end point was cancer-specific QOL assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia scale. Secondary end points were fatigue, psychosocial functioning, physical fitness, body composition, chemotherapy completion rate, and lymphedema.","The follow-up assessment rate for our primary end point was 92.1%, and adherence to the supervised exercise was 70.2%. Unadjusted and adjusted mixed-model analyses indicated that aerobic exercise was superior to usual care for improving self-esteem (P = .015), aerobic fitness (P = .006), and percent body fat (adjusted P = .076). Resistance exercise was superior to usual care for improving self-esteem (P = .018), muscular strength (P &lt; .001), lean body mass (P = .015), and chemotherapy completion rate (P = .033). Changes in cancer-specific QOL, fatigue, depression, and anxiety favored the exercise groups but did not reach statistical significance. Exercise did not cause lymphedema or adverse events.","Neither aerobic nor resistance exercise significantly improved cancer-specific QOL in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, but they did improve self-esteem, physical fitness, body composition, and chemotherapy completion rate without causing lymphedema or significant adverse events."
383,28497396,To evaluate the effects of progressive muscle relaxation training (PMRT) combined with fifive elements music therapy of Chinese medicine (CM) for improving anxiety and depression of cancer patients.,"From June 2015 to March 2016, 60 cancer patients were included into the study. The patients were randomly assigned to a control group and a treatment group by envelope randomization, receiving PMRT and PMRT plus CM five elements music therapy, respectively, for 8 weeks. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Benefit Finding Scales (BFS), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual (FACIT-Sp), and Intervention Expectations Questionnaire (IEQU) were adopted to assess the depression of the two groups before and after the treatment.","Four cases dropped out during the study, and 29 cases in the treatment group and 27 in the control group were included in the fifinal analysis. Prior to the treatments, the baselines of the 4 questionnaires in the two groups showed no difference. After the 8-week treatment, the treatment group presented better levels of HADS, BFS and FACIT-Sp scores compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05). Among the single items of HADS, 4 items involving vexation, feeling fifidgeted, pleasure and prospecting the future in the treatment group were improved compared with the control group (P&lt;0.05).","As a simple and reliable and effective intervention, PMRT combined with fifive elements music therapy mitigated anxiety and depression of cancer patients. Cancer patients have been found to respond well to psychological intervention in areas regarding stabilisation of emotions, disease awareness, and therapeutic compliance. This brings about a great difference in improving their quality of life and psychological state, offers an effective approach to better self-management in cancer treatment."
384,14572428,Dietary intervention is one of the important fields in cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention. The Hiraka Dietary Intervention Study is a community-based randomized cross-over trial designed to develop an effective dietary modification tool and system in an area with high mortality of stomach cancer and stroke.,"The subjects were 550 healthy volunteers and were randomized into two groups with tailored dietary education to decrease sodium intake and to increase vitamin C and carotene intakes either in the first year (intervention group) or in the second year (control group). Dietary changes were assessed using a validated self-administered diet history questionnaire, fasting blood samples, and 48-hour urine samples, which were obtained before and after the one year period.","During the first year, changes differed significantly between the intervention and control group for both dietary sodium intake (-384 and +255 mg/day, intervention and control respectively, p &lt; 0.001) and urinary sodium excretion (-1003 and -84 mg/day, p &lt; 0.001). Although favorable net changes were also observed in dietary carotene (+418 and +220 mug/day, p &lt; 0.05) and vitamin C (+13 and +2 mg/day, p &lt; 0.05), the serum level differences were modest (+13 and -25 mg/L, p = 0.09 for carotene, +0.1 and -0.5 mg/L, p = 0.07 for ascorbic acid).","The present dietary intervention strategy effectively decreased sodium and increased carotene and vitamin C intakes, although the former was more distinct."
385,11162336,The effect of community action on cervical cancer screening rates was explored in 20 rural Australian towns.,"Town quarterly Pap test counts, from the Australian Health Insurance Commission, were converted to town rates using Census populations. Pap test rates for 12 quarters before and after mobilization were examined.","Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests demonstrated significantly higher per capita Pap test rates pre- to postmobilization for intervention towns compared to matched control towns for women whose last Pap test was more than 2 years ago (P=0.008). Maximum efficiency robust tests examining the equality of mean differences (intervention-control) of per capita rates between pre- and post-mobilization periods also found significant differences for Pap tests where last procedure was between 1 and 2 years ago (R = 13.9, P = 0.039) and near significance for Pap tests where last procedure was less than one year ago (R = 10.6, P = 0.087).",It appeared that underscreened women were more likely and overscreened women were less likely to have a Pap test in response to the intervention. The results indicate that a community action program can positively impact cervical cancer screening rates.
386,18676516,"Suboptimal adherence to self-administered medications is a common problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a video-game intervention for improving adherence and other behavioral outcomes for adolescents and young adults with malignancies including acute leukemia, lymphoma, and soft-tissue sarcoma.","A randomized trial with baseline and 1- and 3-month assessments was conducted from 2004 to 2005 at 34 medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A total of 375 male and female patients who were 13 to 29 years old, had an initial or relapse diagnosis of a malignancy, and currently undergoing treatment and expected to continue treatment for at least 4 months from baseline assessment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The intervention was a video game that addressed issues of cancer treatment and care for teenagers and young adults. Outcome measures included adherence, self-efficacy, knowledge, control, stress, and quality of life. For patients who were prescribed prophylactic antibiotics, adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was tracked by electronic pill-monitoring devices (n = 200). Adherence to 6-mercaptopurine was assessed through serum metabolite assays (n = 54).","Adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 6-mercaptopurine was greater in the intervention group. Self-efficacy and knowledge also increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. The intervention did not affect self-report measures of adherence, stress, control, or quality of life.",The video-game intervention significantly improved treatment adherence and indicators of cancer-related self-efficacy and knowledge in adolescents and young adults who were undergoing cancer therapy. The findings support current efforts to develop effective video-game interventions for education and training in health care.
387,11902848,This study assessed the effects of the Health Works for Women (HWW) intervention on improving multiple behaviors including nutrition and physical activity among rural female blue-collar employees in North Carolina.,"Nine small to mid-size workplaces were randomly assigned to either intervention or delayed intervention conditions. After a baseline survey, an intervention consisting of two computer-tailored magazines and a natural helpers program was conducted over 18 months. Delayed worksites received one tailored magazine. Approximately 77 and 76% of baseline respondents completed follow-up surveys at 6 and 18 months, respectively, and 538 women (63%) completed all three surveys.","At the 18-month follow-up, the intervention group had increased fruit and vegetable consumption by 0.7 daily servings compared to no change in the delayed group (P &lt; 0.05). Significant differences in fat intake were observed at 6 months (P &lt; 0.05) but not at 18 months. The intervention group also demonstrated improvements in strengthening and flexibility exercise compared to the delayed group. The rates of smoking cessation and cancer screening did not differ between study groups.",The HWW project was a successful model for achieving certain health behavior changes among blue-collar women.
388,16883902,To study the clinical efficaly and safety of Tiepi Fengdou Granule (TFG) and Capsule (TFC) combined with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in treating lung cancer patients with Qi-Yin asthenia syndrome (QYAS).,"Eighty patients were randomly assigned into 3 groups: the TFG group (32 cases), the TFC group (32 cases) and the Shengmai Capsule control group (16 cases). Changes of symptoms of QYAS, main symptoms of lung cancer, Karnofsky scoring as well as the blood routine test were observed.","The total effective rate of symptom improving in the TFG group and the TFC group was 81.2% and 93.3% respectively, showing insignificant difference between the 2 groups (P &gt; 0.05), but both were higher than that in the Shengmai Capsule control group (50.0%, P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01). Additionally, as compared with those before treatment, the neutrophil count increased and the lymphocytes count obviously decreased in the TFC group after treatment (all P &lt; 0.05).","Both dose-forms of the remedies, TFC and TFG, have significant effects in treating lung cancer with QYAS, but with insignificant difference between them."
389,24743455,"Chronic lymphedema occurs frequently in breast cancer patients and is associated with significant morbidity and reduced quality-of-life. In this pilot study, the authors (1) addressed whether conducting a larger randomized controlled trial of aqua lymphatic therapy (ALT) would be feasible and (2) estimated the extent to which ALT combined with home-based exercise compared with home-based exercise alone would reduce arm disability in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema.","Twenty-five women with breast cancer-related lymphedema were randomized to either ALT in addition to a home land-based exercise program (ALT group; n = 13) or to a home land-based exercise program alone (control group; n = 12). The participants were evaluated before and after a 12-wk intervention period composed of weekly pool exercise sessions. Main outcome measures were arm volume, arm disability, pain, and quality-of-life.","At follow-up, there was no statistical difference between the control and ALT groups in any of the outcomes, except for present pain intensity. At the end of the study period, there was no change in the lymphedematous limb volume in either group. Grip strength was improved in both groups. Only the ALT group showed a statistically significant difference with a reduction in pain intensity score and arm disability. Furthermore, quality-of-life significantly improved only in the ALT group.","Conducting a larger randomized controlled trial would be feasible. In comparison with the beginning of the intervention, the participants in the ALT group showed significant beneficial changes after 12 wks of treatment, whereas the control group did not improve. ALT did not make the lymphedema volume worse and therefore may serve as a safe alternative to land-based treatments of breast cancer-related lymphedema."
390,8224635,"Experimental studies have indicated dietary fish oil as a protective agent in colon carcinogenesis. Prostaglandins have been suggested to be involved in this process. In the present study, the effects of fish oil on rectal cell proliferation (i.e., intermediate biomarker of cancer risk), mucosal membrane fatty acids, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release were investigated in 12 healthy volunteers.","In addition to a controlled basal diet, the test subjects received either fish oil (4.4 g omega-3 fatty acids/day) or corn oil supplements for two 4-week periods in a double-blind, crossover trial. Rectal cell proliferation was determined by bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry and ornithine decarboxylase activity. After 2-hour incubation with bromodeoxyuridine, PGE2 concentration in the incubation medium was measured by radioimmunoassay. Mucosal membrane fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography.","Bromodeoxyuridine labeling index (9.2% vs. 10.9%; P &lt; 0.05), ornithine decarboxylase activity (19.7 vs. 36.4 pmol.mg protein-1.h-1; P &lt; 0.005), and PGE2 release from rectal biopsy specimens (435.5 vs. 671.5 pg/mg wet tissue; P &lt; 0.05) were significantly lower during the fish oil than the corn oil period, whereas membrane fatty acids were not statistically different.",The results support the hypothesis that dietary fish oil may protect against colon cancer.
391,15043176,"The efficacy of prostate cancer screening is uncertain, and professional organizations recommend educating patients about potential harms and benefits. We evaluated the effect of a videotape decision aid on promoting informed decision making about prostate cancer screening among primary care patients.","A group of 160 men, 45 to 70 years of age, with no history of prostate cancer, were randomized to view or not to view a 20-minute educational videotape before a routine office visit at a university-based family medicine clinic. The subjects were contacted again 1 year after their visit to assess their receipt of prostate cancer screening (digital rectal examination [DRE] or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] testing), their satisfaction with their screening decision, and knowledge retention since the baseline assessment.","Follow-up assessments were completed for 87.5% of the intervention subjects and 83.8% of the control subjects. The rate of DRE did not differ between the 2 groups. Prostate-specific antigen testing was reported by 24 of 70 (34.3%) intervention subjects and 37 of 67 (55.2%) control subjects (P = .01). African American men were more likely to have had PSA testing (9 of 16, 56.3%) than were white men (13 of 46, 28.3%) (P = .044). Satisfaction with the screening decision did not differ between the study groups. Intervention subjects were more knowledgeable of prostate cancer screening than were control subjects, although these differences declined within 1 year (P &lt; .001).",Decision aids for prostate cancer screening can have a long-term effect on screening behavior and appear to promote informed decision making.
392,9573911,The purpose of this evaluation is to examine the relationship among nurses' pain management attitudes and pain management practices and to begin to explore the theoretical underpinnings that may influence this relationship.,"A convenience sample of 29 female registered nurses working in hospice or home health settings participated in an educational program 1 day per week for 6 weeks. All participants were asked to complete the Cancer Pain Knowledge Inventory and Survey of Expectations and Pain Assessment Questionnaire 5 weeks before, immediately before, immediately after, 6 months after, and 12 months after the program. Seventeen participants completed all questionnaires at the 6-month follow-up; 16 participants completed all questionnaires at the 1-year follow-up. Personal beliefs about pain were evaluated in relation to the dimensions and treatment of pain. Intentions and expectations to perform specific activities were evaluated in relation to in-depth assessments, equianalgesic conversions, demonstration of new ideas, and communication.","Nurses' attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and expectations about pain and pain management influenced nurses' patient care and educational activities. Nurses who believed that patients should be pain free and nurses who focused on both the dimensions and treatment of pain implemented more pain management activities. In general, nurses who had high intentions and expectations performed more pain management activities.","Although nurses reported change in attitude, and high expectancy for change, feelings of increased credibility, and increased motivation as advocates for new approaches to practice, nurses sometimes found it difficult to implement new practices because of constraints in time and collaborative efforts. To implement new knowledge and achieve individualized goals for change, nurses must be allowed adequate time to analyze the relationships between their beliefs about pain and the ways that they solve patients' pain problems. In addition, more support for multidisciplinary collaboration is needed."
393,30591095,"Oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) training is a kind of breathing exercise with Acapella. The clinical value of OPEP has been widely discussed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis as well as pulmonary cyst.

396,10770979,"We tested the hypothesis that dietary intervention can inhibit the development of recurrent colorectal adenomas, which are precursors of most large-bowel cancers.","We randomly assigned 2079 men and women who were 35 years of age or older and who had had one or more histologically confirmed colorectal adenomas removed within six months before randomization to one of two groups: an intervention group given intensive counseling and assigned to follow a diet that was low in fat (20 percent of total calories) and high in fiber (18 g of dietary fiber per 1000 kcal) and fruits and vegetables (3.5 servings per 1000 kcal), and a control group given a standard brochure on healthy eating and assigned to follow their usual diet. Subjects entered the study after undergoing complete colonoscopy and removal of adenomatous polyps; they remained in the study for approximately four years, undergoing colonoscopy one and four years after randomization.","A total of 1905 of the randomized subjects (91.6 percent) completed the study. Of the 958 subjects in the intervention group and the 947 in the control group who completed the study, 39.7 percent and 39.5 percent, respectively, had at least one recurrent adenoma; the unadjusted risk ratio was 1.00 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.12). Among subjects with recurrent adenomas, the mean (+/-SE) number of such lesions was 1.85+/-0.08 in the intervention group and 1.84+/-0.07 in the control group. The rate of recurrence of large adenomas (with a maximal diameter of at least 1 cm) and advanced adenomas (defined as lesions that had a maximal diameter of at least 1 cm or at least 25 percent villous elements or evidence of high-grade dysplasia, including carcinoma) did not differ significantly between the two groups.","Adopting a diet that is low in fat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables does not influence the risk of recurrence of colorectal adenomas."
397,11914593,To study the effectiveness of the MSC cold cap system to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia.,"The system was applied in 83 cancer patients (mean age 49.8 years) undergoing chemotherapy with alopecia-causing agents. Seven patients did not tolerate the system. Seventy-six patients were evaluable for assessment; 26 received anthracycline (group A), 33 taxane (group T), 5 anthracycline plus taxane (group AT), 7 intravenous etoposide (group E) and 5 ifosfamide with or without other alopecia-causing drugs (group I). In group A, 18 patients received conventional (subgroup Ac) and 8 high doses (subgroup Ah). In group T, 8 patients received docetaxel (subgroup D) and 25 paclitaxel (subgroup P). Alopecia grade 0-1 (Dean's system) was considered as treatment success.","Grade 0-1 alopecia was achieved in 49/76 (64.5%) patients: group T 23/33 (69.6%), subgroup P 16/25 (64%) and subgroup D 7/8 (87.5%); group A 18/26 (69.2%), subgroup Ac 16/18 (88.8%) and subgroup Ah 2/8 (25%); group AT 1/5 (20%); group E 6/7 (85.7%), and group I 1/5 (20%).","The MSC cold cap system is effective in preventing alopecia from anthracycline, etoposide or taxane but not from anthracycline-taxane combinations or ifosfamide-containing regimens."
398,17650803,To observe the effect of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment according to syndrome differentiation on acute radio-reaction (ARR) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.,One hundred and ninety-five NPC patients who received radiotherapy (RT) for the first time were randomly assigned to two groups: the control group (89 cases) was treated by RT alone for 7 weeks and the treatment group (106 cases) was treated by RT combined with oral taking TCM from starting of RT till 5 weeks after RT. The overall changes in total ARR score and ARR in different locations were observed weekly and compared.,"The total ARR score in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P&lt;0.05). And the ARR scores of different organs, including skin, oropharyngeal mucosa, salivary glands, larynx, car, upper digestive tract, and central nervous system, in the treatment group were all lower than those of the corresponding organs in the control group. In addition, the ARR scores in both groups showed an ascending trend in the first 7 weeks and a descending trend from the 8th to the 10th week after beginning RT.",TCM treatment could relieve the ARR in the NPC patients without any affection on the efficacy of RT.
399,9651636,"To describe the short-term impact of the intervention known as Por La Vida (PLV) on cancer screening for Latinas in San Diego, California.",Thirty-six lay community workers (consejeras) were recruited and trained to conduct educational group sessions. Each consejera recruited approximately 14 peers from the community to participate in the program. The consejeras were randomly assigned to either a twelve-week cancer screening intervention group or a control group in which they participated in an equally engaging program entitled &quot;Community Living Skills.&quot; Pre- and post-intervention self-report information was obtained from project participants on the use of cancer screening examinations. Outcome measures were changes in the percentages of women who had breast and cervical cancer screening test within the past year before and after the intervention occurred. Experimental and control groups were compared using t-tests. Analyses were conducted using both consejeras and participants as the unit of analysis.,The increase in the use of the cancer screening test was higher in the PLV cancer intervention group in comparison to women in the community living skills control group.,Key to the PLV intervention model is the identification of natural helpers in the Latino community and their subsequent training in intervention based on social learning theory using culturally appropriate educational materials. The model is an effective and viable approach for increasing the use of cancer screening tests in Latinas of low socioeconomic level and low level of acculturation.
400,15544683,Patients vary widely in their preferences and capacity for participating in treatment decision-making. There are few interventions targeting patient understanding of how doctors make decisions and shared decision-making. This randomized trial investigates the effects of providing cancer patients with a package designed to facilitate shared decision-making prior to seeing their oncologist.,"Sixty-five female cancer patients were randomized to receive either the package (booklet and 15-min video) or a booklet on living with cancer, before their initial consultation. Participants completed questionnaires prior to the intervention, immediately after the oncology consultation, and 2 weeks and 6 months later. The first consultation with the oncologist was audio-taped and transcribed.","Patients receiving the package were more likely than controls to declare their information and treatment preferences in the consultation, and their perspectives on the costs, side-effects and benefits of treatment. Doctors introduced considerably more new themes in the consultations with intervention subjects than they did with controls; no other differences in doctor behaviour were noted.","This short intervention successfully shifted patient and doctor behaviour closer to the shared decision-making model, although it did not alter patients' preferences for information or involvement."
401,22876438,To investigate the clinical effects of Weining granules on gastric precancerous lesions (GPLs).,120 patients with GPLs were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Weining granules (trial group) or the comparator Weifuchun tablets (control group) for 6 months. Outcomes were compared between the two groups including: overall response; gastroscopically-determined response; pathologically-confirmed response; eradication of Helicobacter pylori (HP); microvessel density (MVD) in the gastric mucosa; expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); interleukin 2 (IL-2); interleukin 6 (IL-6); T lymphocyte subsets; immunoglobulins; symptom scores; quality of life (QOL); and adverse reactions.,"Patients in the trial group had a significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) overall response rate (81.7%) as compared with those in the control group (63.3%). Relative to treatment with Weifuchun tablets treatment with Weining granules resulted in a significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) in the scores for gastric pain, distension and stuffiness in the hypochondrium, and anorexia. As compared with the tablets the granules were associated with a significantly higher overall gastroscopically-determined response rate (78.3%; P &lt; 0.05). Pathological examination of tissue samples indicated that 61.7% of patients receiving the granules were cured with an overall response rate of 75.5%; these rates were significantly higher than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). In comparison with patients receiving the tablets, those given the granules were significantly more likely to have their HP eradicated (75.0% vs. 51.4%; P &lt; 0.05). Improvements in MVD, VEGF, CD4+, CD4+/ CD8+, IL-2, IL-6 and IgG were significantly greater with the Weining Granules than with the Weifuchun tablets (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). After follow-up of 1 year, 17.5% of patients in the trial group relapsed as compared with 39.5% in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Relative to the control group, the trial group showed significantly greater improvements in physical, psychological and social relationships, and in environmental domains (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). No significant adverse reactions were observed during treatment.","The Weining granules appear to be effective in improving the gastric precancerous state and the main symptoms, in inhibiting angiogenesis, enhancing immune function and QOL, and in reducing 1-year relapses. In addition, this preparation seems to be associated with a low risk of adverse events, making it a safe and efficacious option for the treatment of GPLs."
402,29599363,"Omega-3 fatty acids may improve cancer cachexia, but only in patients with pancreatic and bile duct cancer. Patients with pancreatic cancer commonly suffer from exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and the ingestion of digestive enzyme supplements may improve absorption.","Racol\u00ae, an enteral nutrient formulated with omega-3 fatty acids, was administered to patients with unresectable pancreatic and bile duct cancer. The skeletal muscle mass and blood test data were taken pre-administration and at 4 and 8 weeks after. Patients with pancreatic cancer were given the digestive enzyme supplement LipaCreon\u00ae from the fifth week after the start of administration.","In all 27 patients, skeletal muscle mass was significantly increased at both 4 and 8 weeks after the start of administration versus pre-administration (p=0.006, p=0.002, respectively).",Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in patients with unresectable pancreatic and bile duct cancer may improve cancer cachexia.
403,18766474,"Breast cancer follow-up programmes consume large resources and despite the indications that several alternative approaches could be used effectively, there is no coherent discussion about costs and/or cost-effectiveness of follow-up programmes.","In a prospective trial there were 264 breast cancer patients, stage I and II, randomised to two different follow-up programmes- PG (physician group) and NG (nurse group). The trial period was 5 years. The women in the two intervention groups did not differ in anxiety and depression, their satisfaction with care, their experienced accessibility to the medical centre or their medical outcome as measured by recurrence or death. The analyses were done from different lists representing costs at three hospitals in Sweden according to the principles of a cost minimization study.","The cost per person year of follow-up differed between the groups, with 630 euro per person year in PG compared to 495 euro per person year in NG. Thus, specialist nurse intervention with check-ups on demand was 20% less expensive than routine follow-up visits to the physician. The main difference in cost between the groups was explained by the numbers of visits to the physician in the respective study arms. There were 21% more primary contacts in PG than NG.","The difference in cost per year and patient by study arm is modest, but transforms to nearly 900 euro per patient and 5-year period, offering a substantial opportunity for reallocating resources since breast cancer is the most prevalent tumour worldwide."
404,18065731,To determine the immediate and long-term effects of true acupuncture versus sham acupuncture on hot flash frequency in women with breast cancer.,"Seventy-two women with breast cancer experiencing three or more hot flashes per day were randomly assigned to receive either true or sham acupuncture. Interventions were given twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. Hot flash frequency was evaluated at baseline, at 6 weeks, and at 6 months after initiation of treatment. Patients initially randomly assigned to the sham group were crossed over to true acupuncture starting at week 7.","The mean number of hot flashes per day was reduced from 8.7 (standard deviation [SD], 3.9) to 6.2 (SD, 4.2) in the true acupuncture group and from 10.0 (SD, 6.1) to 7.6 (SD, 5.7) in the sham group. True acupuncture was associated with 0.8 fewer hot flashes per day than sham at 6 weeks, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.4; P = .3). When participants in the sham acupuncture group were crossed over to true acupuncture, a further reduction in the frequency of hot flashes was seen. This reduction in hot flash frequency persisted for up to 6 months after the completion of treatment.","Hot flash frequency in breast cancer patients was reduced following acupuncture. However, when compared with sham acupuncture, the reduction by the acupuncture regimen as provided in the current study did not reach statistical significance. We cannot exclude the possibility that a longer and more intense acupuncture intervention could produce a larger reduction of these symptoms."
405,15502446,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a comprehensive rehabilitation program on physical function, immune response, fatigue and quality of life in mastectomy patients.","The subjects included fifty-five patients with breast cancer (27 in the control group and 28 in the experimental group). The subjects in the experimental group participated in a comprehensive rehabilitation program for 10 weeks, which was composed of 1 session of education, 2 sessions of stress management, 2 sessions of exercise, and 1 session of peer support group activity per week.","The results revealed an increase in shoulder extension, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation of the affected upper extremity, and in shoulder extension and abduction of the healthy upper extremity. Also an increase in quality of life and a decrease in fatigue were significantly higher in the experimental group than the control group. However, the results revealed that the natural killer cell ratio of the experimental group increased but there was no significant difference from that of the control group.","The 10-week comprehensive rehabilitation program showed a large affirmative effect on physical function, fatigue and quality of life of breast cancer patients after a mastectomy."
406,24633595,"Observational studies suggest that physical activity after a breast cancer diagnosis is associated with improved cancer outcomes; however, no randomized data are available. Here, we report an exploratory follow-up of cancer outcomes from the Supervised Trial of Aerobic versus Resistance Training (START).","The START was a Canadian multicenter trial that randomized 242 breast cancer patients between 2003 and 2005 to usual care (n = 82), supervised aerobic (n = 78), or resistance (n = 82) exercise during chemotherapy. The primary end point for this exploratory analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points were overall survival, distant DFS, and recurrence-free interval. The two exercise arms were combined for analysis (n = 160), and selected subgroups were explored.","After a median follow-up of 89 months, there were 25/160 (15.6%) DFS events in the exercise groups and 18/82 (22.0%) in the control group. Eight-year DFS was 82.7% for the exercise groups compared with 75.6% for the control group (HR, 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-1.24; log-rank, P = 0.21). Slightly stronger effects were observed for overall survival (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.27-1.33; log-rank, P = 0.21), distant DFS (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.32-1.19; log-rank, P = 0.15), and recurrence-free interval (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.30-1.11; Gray test, P = 0.095). Subgroup analyses suggested potentially stronger exercise effects on DFS for women who were overweight/obese (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.27-1.27), had stage II/III cancer (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.31-1.20), estrogen receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.26-1.29), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive tumors (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-1.02), received taxane-based chemotherapies (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.19-1.15), and \u226585% of their planned chemotherapy (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-1.01).",This exploratory follow-up of the START provides the first randomized data to suggest that adding exercise to standard chemotherapy may improve breast cancer outcomes. A definitive phase III trial is warranted.
407,17437502,National guidelines recommending colorectal cancer (CRC) screening for average risk Canadians were released in 2001. The current study determined rates of CRC screening and predictors of screening 3 yr after the guidelines were released.,"A population-based random digit dial telephone survey of 1,808 Alberta men and women aged 50-74 yr assessed awareness about, and self-reported rates of, screening.","More average risk women than men reported a recent screening with a home fecal occult blood test (FOBT) (14.0%vs 9.8%, P= 0.013) but men had slightly higher rates of screening endoscopy in the past 5 yr (4.3%vs 1.6%, P= 0.003). Overall, only 14.3% of average risk adults (N = 1,476) were up-to-date on CRC screening. Multivariable predictors of being up-to-date on CRC screening differed for men and women although a doctor's recommendation for screening was a strong predictor for both genders (men OR 5.0, 2.9-8.3, women OR 3.8, 2.3-6.5). Screening for other cancers was also an important predictor in both men and women.","Three years after the release of national guidelines, rates of screening among average risk adults aged 50-74 yr were very low. Public education programs and primary care interventions to specifically invite average risk adults for screening may be required to increase CRC screening rates."
408,23432360,"Excess body weight and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with the development of several diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer in women. One proposed mechanism linking obesity to chronic diseases is an alteration in adipose-derived adiponectin and leptin levels. We investigated the effects of 12-month reduced calorie, weight loss and exercise interventions on adiponectin and leptin concentrations.","Overweight/obese postmenopausal women (n\u00a0=\u00a0439) were randomized as follows: (i) a reduced calorie, weight-loss diet (diet; N\u00a0=\u00a0118), (ii) moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (exercise; N\u00a0=\u00a0117), (iii) a combination of a reduced calorie, weight-loss diet and moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise (diet\u00a0+\u00a0exercise; N\u00a0=\u00a0117), and (iv) control (N\u00a0=\u00a087). The reduced calorie diet had a 10% weight-loss goal. The exercise intervention consisted of 45\u00a0min of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity 5\u00a0days per week. Adiponectin and leptin levels were measured at baseline and after 12\u00a0months of intervention using a radioimmunoassay.","Adiponectin increased by 9.5% in the diet group and 6.6% in the diet\u00a0+\u00a0exercise group (both P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0001 vs. control). Compared with controls, leptin decreased with all interventions (diet\u00a0+\u00a0exercise, -40.1%, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001; diet, -27.1%, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001; exercise, -12.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). The results were not influenced by the baseline body mass index (BMI). The degree of weight loss was inversely associated with concentrations of adiponectin (diet, P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.0002; diet\u00a0+\u00a0exercise, P-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.0005) and directly associated with leptin (diet, P-trend\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001; diet\u00a0+\u00a0exercise, P-trend\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001).","Weight loss through diet or diet\u00a0+\u00a0exercise increased adiponectin concentrations. Leptin concentrations decreased in all of the intervention groups, but the greatest reduction occurred with diet\u00a0+\u00a0exercise. Weight loss and exercise exerted some beneficial effects on chronic diseases via effects on adiponectin and leptin."
409,28857425,"Colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy usually have elevated levels of inflammatory markers and experience numerous side effects from chemotherapy thereby leading to poor quality of life. Omega-3 fatty acid and microbial cell preparation (MCP) have been known to provide significant benefits in patients on chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementation of omega-3 fatty acid and MCP in quality of life, chemotherapy side effects and inflammatory markers in colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy.","A double-blind randomized study was carried out with 140 colorectal cancer patients on chemotherapy. Subjects were separated into two groups to receive either placebo or MCP [30\u00a0billion colony-forming unit (CFUs) per sachet] at a dose of two sachets daily for 4 weeks, and omega-3 fatty acid at a dose of 2 g daily for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were quality of life, side effects of chemotherapy and levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and C-reactive protein.",The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid improved the overall quality of life and alleviated certain side effects of chemotherapy. The supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid also managed to reduce the level of IL-6 (P = 0.002). There was a significant rise in the placebo group's serum TNF-\u03b1 (P = 0.048) and IL-6 (P = 0.004).,"The combined supplementation with MCP and omega-3 fatty acid may improve quality of life, reduce certain inflammatory biomarkers and relieve certain side effects of chemotherapy in colorectal patients on chemotherapy."
410,9635532,"Despite its effectiveness as a method of controlling cervical carcinoma, the use of Pap smear testing remains incomplete, and its promotion in the primary care setting provides an important opportunity for intervention.","The authors conducted a randomized controlled trial that involved three sites of a health maintenance organization (HMO) serving an urban minority population. Their aim was to evaluate the impact of reminders given to patients and physicians on site visitation by patients and Pap smear use. Eligible women (n=5801) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention combinations (in which reminders were given to either the patient or the physician, to both, or to neither). If they were ineligible for patient reminder intervention, patients were randomized only to physician reminder intervention (the presence or absence of it). The letter of reminder mailed to the patient invited women due for Pap smears to visit the HMO site, and the reminder for physicians was a medical record notice that a Pap smear was due. Logistic and survival analyses were used to investigate the correlation of intervention status with visitation, interval of time to a visit, and Pap smear use.","In the primary intent-to-treat analysis, there was no significant effect of either patient or physician reminder interventions on rates of visitation or Pap smear completion. The secondary efficacy analyses demonstrated no overall effect of either patient or physician reminders, but effects among subgroups of women at individual HMO sites were noted. At Site 3, there was an apparent increase in time to the next visit among the subgroup of women with a chronic illness (16 weeks with intervention vs. 9 weeks without). With the physician reminder, the odds that a Pap smear would be given during the study year were increased among women without a previous Pap smear at Site 1 (adjusted odds ratio=1.39) and those with a chronic illness at Site 2 (adjusted odds ratio=3.38).","Reminders given to patients and physicians had a limited impact on visitation by patients to the HMO sites or Pap smear completion. Although some subgroups of women may benefit, the authors also observed a possibly unfavorable impact among other subgroups. These results emphasize the importance of identifying more effective interventions, targeting them to women most likely to benefit, and not overlooking the possibility that preventive intervention will have an unanticipated adverse effect."
411,16503545,To observe the Chinese herbal medicine Selaginella-induced radiosensitization of terminal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).,"Totally 180 patients with NPC were divided equally into 3 groups with the same radiotherapeutic protocols. The patients in group A received radiotherapy alone, those in group B were given daily Selaginella (30 g) prepared into 50 ml decoction during the entire course of radiotherapy, and those in group C had Selaginella 30 g daily in the late course of radiotherapy.","The complete remission rate of nasopharyngeal primary lesions in groups B and C was significantly higher than that in group A, with also significantly higher complete remission rates of the cervical lymph nodes. The acute toxicity of the skin and mucous membrane was milder in the latter two groups, but the differences were not significant.",Selaginella may induce radiosensitization for terminal NPC and does not increase the acute toxicity of radiotherapy.
412,9663162,This study evaluated the effects of an intervention on rates of skin cancer prevention counseling by pharmacists.,"Fifty-four pharmacies were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Intervention consisted of training, feedback, and prompts. Counseling rates before and after the intervention were obtained from study confederates.","At pretest, the proportions of control and intervention sites providing counseling at least once were 7.4% and 0%, respectively (NS). At posttest, these proportions were 3.7% and 66.7%, respectively (P &lt; .001).",The results indicated that the intervention was successful and that pharmacists can play an important role in educating the public about skin cancer prevention strategies.
413,24151326,"Exercise improves physical functioning and symptom management during breast cancer chemotherapy, but the effects of different doses and types of exercise are unknown.","A multicenter trial in Canada randomized 301 breast cancer patients to thrice-weekly supervised exercise during chemotherapy consisting of either a standard dose of 25 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (STAN; n = 96), a higher dose of 50 to 60 minutes of aerobic exercise (HIGH; n = 101), or a combined dose of 50 to 60 minutes of aerobic and resistance exercise (COMB; n = 104). The primary endpoint was physical functioning assessed by the Medical Outcomes Survey-Short Form (SF)-36. Secondary endpoints were other physical functioning scales, symptoms, fitness, and chemotherapy completion. All statistical tests were linear mixed model analyses, and the P values were two-sided.","Follow-up assessment of patient-reported outcomes was 99.0%. Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses showed that neither HIGH (+0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.8 to 2.4; P = .30) nor COMB (+0.5; 95% CI = -1.1 to 2.1; P = .52] were superior to STAN for the primary outcome. In secondary analyses not adjusted for multiple comparisons, HIGH was superior to STAN for the SF-36 physical component summary (P = .04), SF-36 bodily pain (P = .02), and endocrine symptoms (P = .02). COMB was superior to STAN for endocrine symptoms (P = .009) and superior to STAN (P &lt; .001) and HIGH (P &lt; .001) for muscular strength. HIGH was superior to COMB for the SF-36 bodily pain (P = .04) and aerobic fitness (P = .03). No differences emerged for body composition or chemotherapy completion.",A higher volume of aerobic or combined exercise is achievable and safe during breast cancer chemotherapy and may manage declines in physical functioning and worsening symptoms better than standard volumes.
414,16865681,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality in the US. Surveys reveal low CRC screening levels among Asians in the US, including Chinese Americans.","A randomized controlled trial was conducted with Chinese patients to evaluate a clinic-based, culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention promoting fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening. The multifaceted intervention included a trilingual and bicultural health educator, bilingual materials (a video, a motivational pamphlet, an informational pamphlet, and FOBT instructions), and three FOBT cards. Patients in the control arm received usual care. Our primary outcome measure was FOBT screening within 6 months after randomization. The proportion of FOBT completion in the intervention and control arms was compared by using a chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust for the effects of sociodemographic variables and prior screening history. Potential effect modifications were also tested by using logistic regression models.","Our intervention had a strong effect on FOBT completion (intervention group, 69.5%; control group, 27.6%), and the adjusted odds of FOBT slightly increased to over 6-fold greater in the intervention arm compared with the control arm. No effect modification by age, gender, language, insurance, or prior FOBT was found.","The authors' multifaceted, culturally appropriate intervention significantly increased FOBT screening in a group of low-income and less-acculturated minority patients. Given the large effect size, future research should determine the effective core component(s) that can increase CRC screening in both the general and minority populations."
415,10548868,Fatigue is a common side effect of cancer treatment that impacts quality of life. Exercise is one approach suggested to improve fatigue. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship of exercise to fatigue and quality of life.,"Thirty-one subjects with breast cancer were enrolled prior to beginning chemotherapy and 27 completed the study. All baseline measures were obtained before the first chemotherapy treatment. Subjects were instructed on a home-based, 8-week exercise program.","Women who adopted the exercise program (60%) showed significant increases in functional ability and less weight gain. Exploratory, stepwise multiple regression analyses suggested that the maximum effect of exercise on quality of life outcomes may be mediated by fatigue.","The low-to-moderate intensity, home-based exercise program was feasible for some women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. The results suggest that exercise may affect quality of life and that this effect may be mediated by the effects of exercise on fatigue. Better retention of functional ability and better weight control are additional possible benefits of exposing breast cancer patients to increased exercise. A randomized, controlled clinical trial is needed to establish confidence in these observed relationships."
416,21796050,"This study, theoretically based on the Exercise Self-Esteem Model, EXSEM, examined effects of exercise modality on physical and global self-esteem (PSE, GSE) in breast cancer survivors. The EXSEM posits GSE at the apex with PSE feeding into GSE. PSE has three subdomains: physical condition (PC), attractive body (AB), and physical strength (PS). The goals were to compare the effect of combination modality versus single-modality exercise on PSE and GSE and to explore the relationship between exercise modality and the subdomains of PSE.","Survivors were randomly allocated to flexibility (F), aerobic (A), resistance (R), or aerobic plus resistance (AR), 12-wk, individualized, home-based exercise program. Pre/posttesting included submaximal treadmill test, six-repetition maximum chest press and leg press, YMCA bench press, shoulder/hip flexibility, and bioelectric impedance analysis body composition. Esteem measures were the Physical Self-Perception Profile and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.","Forty-two women completed the study (F = 12, A = 10, R = 9, and AR = 11). Fitness improvements congruent with exercise modality were seen in all groups. PSE and GSE outcomes did not reveal a greater effect from the combination modality program, AR, compared with the single-modality programs A and R. The relationships between the single-modality groups and the subdomains of PC, PS, and AB were supported in the R group (PS and AB increased) and were partially supported in the A group (PC, not AB, increased).","A single-modality R program significantly improved all domains of PSE, and participation in the A program improved the PC subdomain. The combination exercise program did not enhance PSE greater than the single-modality programs. EXSEM was a useful framework for exploring esteem in breast cancer survivors."
417,15925286,"Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation may produce beneficial effects after surgery. We investigated the influence of preoperative administration of a supplement rich in arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and RNA, Impact (Japan), on inflammatory and immune responses in patients undergoing major surgery for cancer.","Patients in the supplement group (n = 12) received 1 L/d of Impact (Japan) for 5 d before surgery, and those in the control group (n = 14) received an ordinary diet without Impact (Japan) before surgery. Plasma levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, thromboxane B(2), prostaglandin E(2), inflammatory markers, nutritional markers, cytokines, and cytokine receptors were obtained 5 d before the operation at the starting point of supplementation in the supplement group. Samples were collected on postoperative days (PODs) 0, 1, 3, and 7.","After taking the supplement, significant increases in omega-3 fatty acids and rapid turnover proteins were found the day after ending supplementation (POD-0), whereas thromboxane B(2) levels and the ratio of omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids were significantly lower than before supplementation (P &lt; 0.001). On POD-0 only, inflammatory markers and cytokine receptors in the supplement group showed low levels in comparison with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). On POD-1 and POD-3, remarkable decreases in polymorphonuclear leukocyte-elastase and interleukin-8 in the supplement group were observed.",Our findings suggest that oral administration of a supplement rich in omega-3 fatty acids for 5 d before surgery may improve not only preoperative nutritional status but also preoperative and postoperative inflammatory and immune responses in patients who have cancer.
418,30071146,"The objective of the study is to test theoretical intervention fidelity and feasibility of MOVING ON, a self-directed, home-based, randomized controlled trial to increase exercise outcome expectations (OEs) (what one expects to obtain or avoid as a result of a behavior or lack thereof), among breast cancer survivors.","Stage Ia to IIb survivors (n\u00a0=\u00a060) were given the MOVING ON intervention or control booklet. Data were collected through online surveys and an accelerometer at baseline, 4, 8, and 12\u00a0weeks postintervention. Fidelity was measured by questions assessing participant perceptions of MOVING ON (score \u22652) and direction of intervention effects. Feasibility was measured by recruitment rate (target of 60 participants in 6\u00a0months), retention (total attrition &lt;17%), and acquisition of accelerometer data (% \u2265subjective exercise data obtained). Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, mixed models, and content analysis.","Fidelity met a priori criteria (mean\u00a0=\u00a03.31, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.87). Outcome expectations increased 0.01 points, and weekly steps increased by 970 every 4\u00a0weeks in the intervention arm compared to the control arm. All effect sizes were small, ranging from 0.01 to 0.09. Target enrollment, achieved in 17\u00a0weeks, met a priori feasibility criteria. Retention (66%) and accelerometer data acquisition (60%) (compared to 73% of subjective exercise data) did not.","MOVING ON influenced OEs as intended and was well received by participants. A fully powered study, of this low-cost, easy-to-implement intervention, is warranted. Intervention and measurement strategies used in MOVING ON can be incorporated in any study targeting OEs as a mediator of exercise or collecting exercise data with an accelerometer."
419,16991107,The purpose of this investigation was to systematically examine the efficacy of providing men with prostate cancer with an audiotape of their primary treatment consultation.,Participants included 425 men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 15 radiation oncologists from 4 cancer centers in Canada. Patients were block randomized to one of four consultation groups: 1. Standard care control--not audio-taped; 2. Audio-taped--no audiotape given; 3. Audio-taped--patient given audiotape; and 4. Audio-taped--patient offered choice of receiving audiotape or not (4 patients declined; 94 accepted). Patient outcomes were measured at 12 weeks post-consultation: perceived degree of information provision; audiotape satisfaction and use; communication satisfaction with oncologist; mood state; and cancer-specific quality of life.,"Patients receiving the consultation audiotape reported having been provided with significantly more disease and treatment information in general (p=0.04), and more information about treatment alternatives (p=0.04) and treatment side effects (p=0.01) in particular, than patients who did not receive the audiotape. Audiotape benefit was not significantly related to patient satisfaction with communication, mood state or quality of life at 12 weeks post-consultation, and was not significantly affected by choice of receiving the audiotape. Patients rated the audiotape intervention positively, with an average score of 83.0 out of 100.","Consultation audiotapes are rated highly by men with prostate cancer, and these audiotapes help to enhance their perception of having been provided with critical disease- and treatment-related information."
420,14752875,The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of physical therapy intervention in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).,"Twenty-eight children aged 4-15 years were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group received five sessions of physical therapy and was instructed to perform an individualized home exercise program consisting of ankle dorsiflexion stretching, lower extremity strengthening, and aerobic exercise.",After 4 months children who received physical therapy intervention had significantly improved ankle dorsiflexion active range of motion and knee extension strength (P &lt; 0.01). Differences were not found between the two groups for any of the other dependent variables.,Physical therapy intervention for children with ALL receiving maintenance chemotherapy improved two body functions important for normal gait. Physical therapy programs initiated earlier in treatment and with greater emphasis on endurance activities may also improve stamina and quality of life (QOL).

423,29723235,"Anma therapy (Japanese massage therapy, AMT) significantly reduces the severity of physical complaints in survivors of gynecologic cancer. However, whether this reduction of severity is accompanied by improvement in health-related quality of life is unknown.","Forty survivors of gynecologic cancer were randomly allocated to either an AMT group that received one 40-min AMT session per week for 8 weeks or a no-AMT group. We prospectively measured quality of life by using the Japanese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline and at 8-week follow-up. The QLQ-C30 response rate was 100%. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), and Measure of Adjustment to Cancer were also prespecified and prospectively evaluated.","The QLQ-C30 Global Health Status and Quality of Life showed significant improvement at 8 weeks (P = 0.042) in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group, and the estimated mean difference reached a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points (10.4 points, 95% CI = 1.2 to 19.6). Scores on fatigue and insomnia showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group (P = 0.047 and 0.003, respectively). There were no significant between-group improvements in HADS anxiety and depression scales; however, POMS-assessed anger-hostility showed significant improvement in the AMT group compared with the no-AMT group (p = 0.028).",AMT improved health-related quality of life in gynecologic cancer survivors. AMT can be of potential benefit for applications in oncology.
424,16769267,Intestinal motility after gastric surgery frequently is disturbed and results in postoperative intestinal symptoms and poor quality of life (QOL). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Dai-kenchu-to on intestinal motility and postoperative QOL of patients.,Seventeen patients who underwent total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch interposition for gastric cancer in the Department of Surgery of Osaka University Medical Hospital were enrolled. The patients were assigned randomly to the cross-over study with or without 15 g/d of Dai-kenchu-to. Questionnaires and emptying tests using (111)In-labeled liquid and (99m)Tc-labeled solid test meal were performed at the end of each treatment period. A manometric study was performed in 6 patients to measure contractile activity with or without Dai-kenchu-to.,"Stasis-related symptoms were reduced significantly by Dai-kenchu-to (P = .032). In the emptying test, Dai-kenchu-to accelerated emptying of both liquid (P &lt; .01) and solid (P = .015) meals from the pouch. The pouch showed bursts of contractions, which were increased significantly by oral intake of Dai-kenchu-to (P = .028).",Dai-kenchu-to increased intestinal motility and decreased postoperative symptoms of patients with total gastrectomy with jejunal pouch interposition.
425,28693484,"Many teenagers are insufficiently active despite the health benefits of physical activity (PA). There is strong evidence to show that inactivity and low fitness levels increase the risk of non-communicable diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes and breast and colon cancers (Lee et al. Lancet 380:219-29, 2012). A major barrier facing adolescents is accessibility (e.g. cost and lack of local facilities). The ACTIVE project aims to tackle this barrier through a multi-faceted intervention, giving teenagers vouchers to spend on activities of their choice and empowering young people to improve their fitness and PA levels.","ACTIVE is a mixed methods randomised control trial in 7 secondary schools in Swansea, South Wales. Quantitative and qualitative measures including PA (cooper run test (CRT), accelerometery over 7\u00a0days), cardiovascular (CV) measures (blood pressure, pulse wave analysis) and focus groups will be undertaken at 4 separate time points (baseline, 6\u00a0months,12\u00a0months and follow-up at 18\u00a0months).

426,18421460,The effects of printed educational material on cancer screening in women (Pap test and mammography) are well documented and confirmed by several studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of similar printed educational material on prostate cancer screening by PSA and DRE.,"Thousand five hundred men aged between 50 and 86 years of age, who attended our institutions for various medical conditions except prostate-related conditions, were randomly assigned to two study groups. Men in the informed group, received an educational leaflet with simple, general information on prostate cancer screening methods given by their physician along with treatment and other regular recommendations, while men in the non-informed group, were only informed by their physician in the examination room during an interview.","After 24 months, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of DRE screening. The percentages of men who were actually screened by DRE were 4 and 5% in the informed and non-informed groups, respectively, while the difference in the percentages of PSA screening was of statistical significance, with 31% of men screened in the non-informed group as compared to 93% of men screened in the informational leaflet group.","A single, one-shift distribution of printed educational material on prostate cancer screening, changed their attitude regarding prostate cancer screening only in favour of PSA testing, while did not manage to change the DRE acceptance behavior. However, since the combination of the two tests is more sensitive for diagnosis than either one alone, there is a need of introducing intervention strategies, in the efforts of ameliorating the prostate cancer screening behavior."
427,12957259,Recent studies have suggested that acupuncture may improve radiation-induced xerostomia with an increase in the median salivary flow rate and sustained symptom relief. An acupuncture-like transcutaneous nerve stimulation method (Codetron) without invasive needles was developed to mimic acupuncture treatment. This Phase I-II study examined the effectiveness of Codetron in treating radiation-induced xerostomia.,Patients with symptomatic xerostomia after radical radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer but with evidence of residual salivary function were recruited into the study. Two 6-week courses of Codetron treatment of acupuncture points preselected according to traditional Chinese medicine principles were given with a 2-week break between each course. Basal and citric acid-primed whole saliva production were measured at baseline and up to 1 year after treatment completion. Xerostomia symptoms were assessed by a five-item xerostomia symptom questionnaire with a visual analog scale and quality of life was evaluated using the Head and Neck Radiotherapy Questionnaire.,"We enrolled 46 patients in the study. All patients had received radiotherapy doses of &gt;or=50 Gy to bilateral head-and-neck fields, including the parotid glands. Of the 46 patients, 37 completed the follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion. No Codetron treatment-related complications occurred. Improvement in xerostomia symptoms was noted, with a mean increase in the visual analog scale score of 86 (p &lt; 0.0005) and 77 (p &lt; 0.0001) at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion, respectively. For all patients, the increase in the mean basal and citric acid-primed whole saliva production at 3 and 6 months after treatment completion was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). No statistically significant change in the quality-of-life evaluation compared with baseline was observed.",The results suggest that Codetron treatment improves whole saliva production and related symptoms in patients with radiation-induced xerostomia. The treatment effects were sustained for at least 6 months after Codetron treatment completion. A prospective randomized Phase III trial with appropriate controls is being planned.
428,16021478,"In this multicenter crossover study, our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and acceptance of acupuncture as a supportive antiemetic approach during highly emetogenic chemotherapy in pediatric oncology.","Eleven children receiving several courses of highly emetogenic chemotherapy for treatment of solid tumors were included. Randomization allocated patients to start chemotherapy either with antiemetic medication plus acupuncture or antiemetic medication alone. During all study courses, patients continued to receive their programmed and additional antiemetic medication as needed. Acupuncture was given at day 1 of chemotherapy and at subsequent days on patient's demand. The amount of baseline and additional antiemetic medication during chemotherapy was documented. Patients maintained a daily diary of vomiting episodes and completed an evaluated nausea score at the end of every course. Their body weight was taken before and after a chemotherapy course.","Twenty-two courses with or without acupuncture were compared. The benefits of acupuncture in adolescents with respect to the reduction of additional antiemetic medication were observed. Acupuncture enabled patients to experience higher levels of alertness during chemotherapy and reduced nausea and vomiting. Except for needle pain, no side effects were noted. Patient's acceptance of acupuncture was high.",Our data indicate that acupuncture might reduce antiemetic medication and episodes of vomiting in pediatric oncology.
429,10348277,"The association between radiotherapy for gynecological carcinoma and sexual dysfunction is well established. Regular vaginal dilation is widely recommended to these women as a way for them to maintain vaginal health and good sexual functioning. However, the compliance rate with this recommendation is low. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a group psychoeducational program based on the &quot;information-motivation-behavioral skills&quot; model of behavior change in increasing the rate of compliance.","Thirty-two women with Stage I or II cervical or endometrial carcinoma who were being treated with radiotherapy were randomized and received either the experimental group program or the control intervention that consisted of written information and brief counseling. Outcome measures included global sexual health, knowledge about sexuality and cancer, fears about sexuality after cancer, and vaginal dilation compliance.","Younger women attending the experimental program (44.4%) were significantly more likely to follow recommendations for vaginal dilation than those who received the control intervention (5.6%). Women, regardless of age, who received the experimental intervention reported less fear about sex after cancer treatment. The older women who received the experimental intervention gained more sexual knowledge. There was no evidence that the experimental intervention improved global sexual health.","This is the first controlled study to provide evidence of an intervention's effectiveness 1. in increasing women's vaginal dilation following radiotherapy for gynecological carcinoma and 2. in reducing their fears about sex after cancer. Most women, particularly younger women, are unlikely to follow the recommendation to dilate unless they are given assistance in overcoming their fears and taught behavioral skills."

The radiation reactions during radiotherapy and the condition of late stage radiation injury radiotherapy in patients in the 2 groups were observed.","The degree of oropharyngeal mucosa reaction, dryness in mouth and radiation dermatitis in cervical region in the observed group was milder than those in the control group, and the radiation injury induced late stage sequelae, such as the degree of mouth-opening was better and the cervical muscular sclerosis was better in the observed group than in the control group, showing significant difference (P &lt; 0.01).",SFR has definite effect in preventing and treating radiation reaction and late stage radiation injury in patients with head and neck tumor.
431,9440013,This study tested the effectiveness of pelvic muscle exercise (PME) with biofeedback in reducing the length of time urinary incontinence (UI) was experienced following a radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.,"Fifty-three men were randomly assigned to an education intervention group or a control group. The education group received instruction in PME/biofeedback and were given a PME protocol to perform three times per week for 12 weeks. The control group did not receive instruction in PME technique. Both groups recorded urine losses in three-day bladder diaries, and 24-hour pad tests were done in weeks 2, 5, 9, and 12 after surgery. Study variables included: 1) length of time urine loss was experienced; 2) episodes and frequency of urine loss; and 3) ounces of urine lost and number of pads used.","The PME/biofeedback group regained continence at a mean of 51 days; the non-PME group at 56 days. Although the PME group demonstrated reductions in episodes, frequency, ounces of urine lost by UI, and pad usage, they were not statistically significant.","After prostatectomy, men experience UI for periods of one to 80+ days. The use of biofeedback enhances learning PME and skill performance. Bladder diaries and behavioral management techniques (PME) need to be further studied as appropriate treatment methods to assist men in managing UI after cancer surgery."
432,23636649,"The purposes of this study are to examine (1) the feasibility and efficacy of two different home-based exercise protocols on the level of physical activity (PA), and (2) the effect of increased PA via home-based exercise program on biomarkers of colorectal cancer.","Seventeen patients (age 55.18 \u00b1 13.3 years) with stage II-III colorectal cancer completed the 12-week home-based exercise program. Subjects were randomized into either casually intervened home-based exercise group (CIHE) or intensely intervened home-based exercise group (IIHE). The primary outcome was the level of PA. Furthermore, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin-like growth factor axis, and adipocytokines were measured.","Both CIHE and IIHE program significantly increased the level of PA at 12 weeks compared to its level at baseline (CIHE, 10.00 \u00b1 8.49 vs. 46.07 \u00b1 45.59; IIHE, 12.08 \u00b1 11.04 vs. 35.42 \u00b1 27.42 MET hours per week). Since there was no difference in PA change between groups (p = 0.511), the data was combined in analyzing the effects of increased PA on biomarkers. Increase in PA significantly reduced insulin (6.66 \u00b1 4.58 vs. 4.86 \u00b1 3.48 \u03bcU/ml, p = 0.006), HOMA-IR (1.66 \u00b1 1.23 vs. 1.25 \u00b1 1.04, p = 0.017), and tumor necrosis alpha-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1 4.85 \u00b1 7.88 vs. 2.95 \u00b1 5.38 pg/ml, p = 0.004), and significantly increased IGF-1 (135.39 \u00b1 60.15 vs. 159.53 ng/ml, p = 0.007), IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 (2.67 \u00b1 1.48 vs. 3.48 \u00b1 1.00 ng/ml, p = 0.013), and adiponectin (6.73 \u00b1 3.07 vs. 7.54 \u00b1 3.96 \u03bcg/ml, p = 0.015).","CIHE program was as effective as IIHE program in increasing the level of PA, and the increase in PA resulted in significant change in HOMA-IR, IGF-1 axis, TNF-\u03b1, and adiponectin levels in stage II-III colorectal cancer survivors."
433,16755179,"To inform female Hodgkin disease (HD) survivors, younger than 35 at diagnosis, of their increased risk for breast cancer and encourage them to seek breast cancer screening.","An evidence-based intervention, telephone counseling, was used in a pre-post test design, randomized trial with the control group being offered the intervention following the post-test. Women treated at Stanford University who received thoracic irradiation before age 35, alive and HD-free at last contact, were referred to the project (n = 471). Of 261 eligible women who could be located, 157 completed the pretest and were randomized (60% response rate) and 133 completed the post-test (85% retention rate).","There was a positive intervention effect on mammography maintenance: the odds of being in maintenance at post-test compared with pretest were greater in the intervention group than in the control group [odds ratio (OR) = 3.6]. Women were more likely to be in mammography maintenance at pre- or post-test if at pretest they were married (OR = 5.7), employed (OR = 2.3), more worried about breast cancer (OR = 1.4 per unit of scale), or received an annual physical examination (OR = 2.2). Women under age 40 were much less likely to be in maintenance than were those age 45 and over (age 35-39, OR = 0.2; under age 35, OR = 0.07).","The findings indicate that providing risk information encourages cancer survivors to take health preventive actions.

434,21355946,To examine the effect of regular Iyengar yoga practice on measures of self-perceived psychosocial function and diurnal salivary cortisol secretion in stage II-IV breast cancer survivors (n = 18).,"Women were randomly assigned to attend yoga practice for 90 min twice weekly for 8 weeks (n = 9) or to a wait-listed, noninterventional control group (n = 9). Traditional Iyengar yoga routines that progressively increased in difficulty as participants gained strength and flexibility were used. At baseline and after the 8-week study period, women completed self-report instruments to document various aspects of psychosocial and physical functioning, and collected salivary samples for cortisol analysis four times during the day for two consecutive days.",The yoga group had lower morning and 5 p.m. salivary cortisol and improved emotional well-being and fatigue scores.,"Breast cancer survivors are at risk for chronic psychosocial distress that may alter activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in aberrant regulation of cortisol secretion and increased risk of immune dysfunction and cancer progression. Regular yoga practice may be a low-risk, cost-effective way to improve psychosocial functioning, fatigue, and regulation of cortisol secretion in breast cancer survivors. These findings require validation with a larger randomized study."
435,12970142,"N-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may possess anticachectic properties. This trial compared a protein and energy dense supplement enriched with n-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (experimental: E) with an isocaloric isonitrogenous control supplement (C) for their effects on weight, lean body mass (LBM), dietary intake, and quality of life in cachectic patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.","A total of 200 patients (95 E; 105 C) were randomised to consume two cans/day of the E or C supplement (480 ml, 620 kcal, 32 g protein +/- 2.2 g EPA) for eight weeks in a multicentre, randomised, double blind trial.","At enrolment, patients' mean rate of weight loss was 3.3 kg/month. Intake of the supplements (E or C) was below the recommended dose (2 cans/day) and averaged 1.4 cans/day. Over eight weeks, patients in both groups stopped losing weight (delta weight E: -0.25 kg/month versus C: -0.37 kg/month; p = 0.74) and LBM (Delta LBM E: +0.27 kg/month versus C: +0.12 kg/month; p = 0.88) to an equal degree (change from baseline E and C, p&lt;0.001). In view of evident non-compliance in both E and C groups, correlation analyses were undertaken to examine for potential dose-response relationships. E patients demonstrated significant correlations between their supplement intake and weight gain (r = 0.50, p&lt;0.001) and increase in LBM (r = 0.33, p = 0.036). Such correlations were not statistically significant in C patients. The relationship of supplement intake with change in LBM was significantly different between E and C patients (p = 0.043). Increased plasma EPA levels in the E group were associated with weight and LBM gain (r = 0.50, p&lt;0.001; r = 0.51, p = 0.001). Weight gain was associated with improved quality of life (p&lt;0.01) only in the E group.","Intention to treat group comparisons indicated that at the mean dose taken, enrichment with n-3 fatty acids did not provide a therapeutic advantage and that both supplements were equally effective in arresting weight loss. Post hoc dose-response analysis suggests that if taken in sufficient quantity, only the n-3 fatty acid enriched energy and protein dense supplement results in net gain of weight, lean tissue, and improved quality of life. Further trials are required to examine the potential role of n-3 enriched supplements in the treatment of cancer cachexia."
436,20522448,To assess the efficacy and safety of dietary supplements in patients with early stage prostate cancers who are managed expectantly.,"Seventy-four patients with early prostate cancer, who were treated with expectant management, enrolled in the study. A mushroom mycelium extract was given at a dose of 4.5 g/day for 6 months. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in which the prostate specific antigen level decreased by 50% or more following treatment. The adverse events, change of prostate specific antigen value and quality of life were also evaluated.","In only one of 74 patients (1.4%), the prostate specific antigen value decreased more than 50%. Grade 2 diarrhea and grade 1 itching were observed in one patient, and patient ingestion compliance was maintained near 100%. The alternation of prostate specific antigen values was stable before and after treatment. In subjects with strong anxiety prior to supplement ingestion, these feelings were significantly alleviated (state anxiety, P = 0.0018; trait anxiety, P = 0.0099).","In this phase II study of early prostate cancer patients who were managed expectantly, a mushroom mycelium extract was an ineffective treatment for reducing 50% or more the patient prostate specific antigen values."
437,23640558,Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) suffer from fatigue causing a decrease in functional capacity and quality of life (QoL). Limited research in the field of exercise training among these patients demanded the need for this study to assess the effects of exercise training on functional capacity and quality of life.,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 48 patients with HNC undergoing CRT. The exercise group received an individually tailored, supervised, exercise programme for six weeks, while the control group did not receive any form of exercise.

Participants completed a questionnaire prior to receiving the leaflet or viewing the video, immediately afterward, and 1 month later.","One hundred fifteen questionnaires were returned (response rate = 93%). Both videos and leaflets increased knowledge with mean percentage improvements in scores of 71% (95% CI = 40.2-100) and 49% (95% CI = 32.1-66), respectively. However, the difference between the two interventions was not statistically significant (Difference = 22%, 95% CI = -56.3-13.2, p = 0.2). After 1 month, knowledge levels decreased in both groups to 55% (95% CI = 33.2-75.8; video plus leaflet) and 36% (95% CI = 23.7-48.6; leaflet alone).","Leaflets and videos have an important role in reinforcing information provided by clinicians. However, there appears to be no immediate or prolonged advantage of a video over and above that of a simple information leaflet. The cost implications of producing a video, such as extra staff time, need to be weighed against the minor benefit that this medium has to offer."
439,15684846,"Fatigue is one of the most distressful symptoms experienced by patients with advanced cancer. Aromatherapy, footsoak, and reflexology are popular health care modality treatments in Japan, however, the effectiveness of each treatment for cancer-related fatigue has not been fully established.","To investigate the effectiveness of combined modality treatment consisting of aromatherapy, footsoak, and reflexology against fatigue, an open study was performed in 20 terminally ill patients with cancer. After a patch test was performed, patients received aromatherapy that was accompanied with footsoak in warm water containing lavender essential oil for 3 minutes, followed by reflexology treatment with jojoba oil containing lavender for 10 min. Fatigue was evaluated using the Cancer Fatigue Scale (CFS) before, 1 hour after, and 4 hours after treatment.","Total CFS scores improved significantly after this treatment (from 25.6 +/- 11.0 to 18.1 +/- 10.0, p &lt; 0.001). Among three CFS subscales, physical and cognitive subscale scores were reduced significantly (11.3 +/- 6.1 to 6.7 +/- 6.1, p &lt; 0.001; 4.5 +/- 3.2 to 2.4 +/- 2.4, p &lt; 0.001). No adverse effects were experienced. Because all patients desired to continue this treatment, they received treatment eight times on average.","Combined modality treatment consisting of aromatherapy, footsoak, and reflexology appears to be effective for alleviating fatigue in terminally ill cancer patients. To confirm safety and effectiveness of this combined modality treatment, further investigation including randomized treatment assignment is warranted."

In the experimental group, post-education (T4) depression was better than baseline (T0). For both groups, functional dysphagia QOL and physical dysphagia QOL were greatest at T0, decreased from T1 to T2, and slightly decreased at T3 and T4. There were no differences between the groups and within the groups with respect to dysphagia-specific health-related QOL, global dysphagia QOL, functional dysphagia QOL, and physical dysphagia QOL.",The SEEP was effective in improving emotional dysphagia QOL during the initial 6\u00a0months after treatment of patients with OCC.
441,12544628,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the impact of undertaking peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBST) on T-cell number and function, and to determine the role of a mixed type, moderate intensity exercise program in facilitating the recovery of T-cell number and function.","Immunological measures of white blood cell, lymphocyte, CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts, and CD3 cell function were assessed pretransplant (PI), immediately posttransplant (PII), and 1 month (I1), 2 months (I2) and 3 months (PIII) posttransplant. After PII, 12 patients were divided equally into a control group (CG) or exercise intervention group (EG).","Lower total T-cell, helper T-cell, and suppressor T-cell counts (P&lt; 0.01), as well as lower T-cell function (P&lt; 0.01), when compared with normative data, were found at PI. More specifically, 88% of the group had CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts that were more than 40%, 20%, and 50% below normal at PI, respectively. Undertaking a PBST caused further adverse changes to the total leukocyte, lymphocyte, CD3, CD4 and CD8 count, and the helper/suppressor ratio. Although CD8 counts had returned to normal by PIII, CD3, CD4, and the CD4 /CD8 ratio remained significantly lower than normative data (P&lt; 0.01), with 66%, 100%, and 100% of the subject group reporting counts and ratios, respectively, below the normal range.","The PBST patients were immunocompromised before undertaking the transplant, and the transplant procedure imposed further adverse changes to the leukocyte and lymphocyte counts. The leukocyte and CD8 counts returned to normal within 3 months posttransplant; however, the other immunological parameters assessed demonstrated a delayed recovery. Although participation in the exercise program did not facilitate a faster immune cell recovery, neither did the exercise program hinder or delay recovery."
442,28319589,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) experience unfavorable changes in body composition and associated metabolic complications, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. We examined the effect of a 6-month program of aerobic and resistance exercise aimed at improving body composition and cardiorespiratory health in this population.","Ninety-seven men (43-90 yr) with localized prostate cancer receiving ADT were randomized to either exercise (EX, n = 50) or usual care (CON, n = 47). Supervised exercise was undertaken twice weekly at moderate to high intensity. Measures of cardiorespiratory capacity (V\u02d9O2max), resting metabolic rate, central blood pressure, hemodynamic variables, blood markers, and body composition were assessed.","There was a significant group-time interaction present for V\u02d9O2max (P = 0.033) with a treatment effect for EX of 0.11 L\u00b7min (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.19) (relative to body mass = 1.3 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min, 95% CI = 0.3-2.3) and fat oxidation (P = 0.037) of 12.0 mg\u00b7min (95% CI = 2.3-21.7). Similarly, there was a significant improvement in glucose (P &lt; 0.001) for EX of -0.5 mmol\u00b7L (95% CI = -0.8 to -0.3), with no change in prostate-specific antigen or testosterone as a result of exercise.

443,24639036,"Long-term survivors of pediatric cancer have an increased risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and dysfunctional anxiety. However, there is a lack of evidence-based psychotherapy tailored to the needs of this target group. In this single-arm pilot study, an Internet-based psychological intervention (&quot;Onco-STEP&quot;) for adolescent and young adult survivors was developed, and its efficacy in reducing PTSS and anxiety was evaluated.","Former patients of pediatric cancer older than 15 years manifesting clinically relevant PTSS or anxiety were eligible. The cognitive-behavioral treatment consists of ten writing sessions and comprises two modules: the first aiming to reprocess the traumatic cancer-related experiences and the second aiming to build coping strategies with current cancer-related fears. Treatment was delivered via written messages on a secure Internet platform. Outcomes were assessed by the Post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Fear of Progression/Relapse Questionnaire.","A total of 20 participants completed the intervention (mean age 27.3 \u00b1 4.8 years at study; 13.8 \u00b1 4.7 years since diagnosis; 70 % female). PTSS, anxiety, and fear of progression/relapse significantly declined at the end of the intervention, with pre-post effect sizes of 0.63, 0.74, and 0.48. In addition, we found a significant decrease in symptoms of depression. Except for the improvement in depression, all effects were sustained 3 months after the end of treatment.",The results show that the intervention is efficacious in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress and anxiety. Onco-STEP is a promising new way to treat young adult long-term survivors of pediatric cancer with late psychological effects. Future efforts need to focus on investigating specific evidence of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial.
444,24458543,This secondary analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial explores associations between common symptom clusters and evaluates pre-treatment to post-treatment changes in clinical levels of these symptoms following cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).,"Baseline data from 113 participants with insomnia were explored to establish rates of and associations between clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression across the sample. Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression.","At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia\u2009+\u2009fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between group allocation and changes in symptoms of insomnia and fatigue. No such relationship was found between group allocation and mood variables.","These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue. CBT-I appears to offer generalised benefit to the symptom cluster as a whole and, specifically, is effective in reducing fatigue, which exceeded clinical cut-offs prior to implementation of the intervention. This has implications for the diagnosis/management of common symptoms in cancer patients."
445,17222649,"Zinc is a common dietary supplement that is widely believed to have beneficial health effects. To assess the impact of high dose supplemental zinc on genitourinary diseases we analyzed a recent randomized trial comparing zinc, antioxidants and their combination to placebo for complications related to the genitourinary tract.","In a further analysis of the recent Age-related Eye Disease Study we examined the data pool for primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes given for hospital admissions related to urological problems. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study randomized 3,640 patients with age related macular degeneration to 1 of 4 study arms, including placebo, antioxidants (500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E and 15 mg beta-carotene), 80 mg zinc and antioxidant plus zinc. Statistical analyses using Fisher's exact test were performed.","We found a significant increase in hospital admissions due to genitourinary causes in patients on zinc vs nonzinc formulations (11.1% vs 7.6%, p = 0.0003). The risk was greatest in male patients (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07-1.50, p = 0.008). In the study group of 343 patients requiring hospital admission the most common primary International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision codes included benign prostatic hyperplasia/urinary retention (benign prostatic hyperplasia), urinary tract infection, urinary lithiasis and renal failure.

These data support the hypothesis that high dose zinc supplementation has a negative effect on select aspects of urinary physiology.
446,17966839,"The objective was to determine whether food affects the pharmacokinetics and safety of lonafanib, an orally bioavailable farnesyl transferase inhibitor that is under clinical evaluation for the treatment of various hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.","Two Phase 1 studies were conducted in separate patient populations. A single-dose study was performed in 12 healthy subjects who received lonafarnib 100 mg under fasted and fed conditions. Additionally, a multiple-dose study was performed in 19 patients with advanced cancer who received lonafarnib 200 mg Q 12 H for 28 days under fasted and fed conditions. Nine of the 19 patients completed both treatment cycles and were used for pharmacokinetic assessment. A 2-week washout period separated treatments in each study. Single-dose pharmacokinetics were assessed at various time points up to 48 hours postdose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics were assessed at Day 15 for 24 hours postdose.","The pharmacokinetics of lonafarnib were affected by food during single-dose but not multiple-dose administration. Relative oral bioavailabilities (fed vs. fasted) based on log-transformed maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were 48% and 77%, respectively, following single-dose administration, and 87% and 96%, respectively, following multiple-dose administration. Intrasubject variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters was less pronounced after multiple dosing (17%) than that after single dosing (33%) of lonafarnib. Intersubject variability was unaffected by food in either study. In the single-dose study, 7 of the 12 subjects (58%) reported treatment emergent adverse events, the most common being headache. No clinically significant differences in adverse events were seen between fasting and fed states after a single dose administration. Thus, single dose 100 mg lonafarnib was safe and generally well tolerated. In the multiple-dose study, all 19 subjects reported at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. General disorders including fatigue and anorexia, and gastrointestinal disorders including diarrhea, vomiting and nausea, were the most commonly reported adverse events after multiple doses. While gastrointestinal adverse events were reported with equal frequency under both fasting (82%, 14/17) and fed states (83%, 15/18), the incidence of severe gastrointestinal adverse events was higher in fasted (47%, 8/17) vs. fed subjects (22%, 4/18) after multiple-dose administration.",The administration of food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of lonafanib following multiple-dose administration. We recommend that multiple-dose lonafarnib should be administered with food to enhance tolerability.

448,8357293,"We evaluated recurrence and survival for 68 patients with malignant melanoma who participated in a 6-week structured psychiatric group intervention 5 to 6 years earlier, shortly after their diagnosis and initial surgical treatment. We also explored the role of several factors as possible predictors of outcome.","This was a randomized controlled experimental study. The Cox proportion hazards regression model was used to quantify the relationship between treatment and the outcomes adjusted by the covariates (age, sex, Breslow depth, tumor site, baseline Profile of Mood States Total Mood Disturbance, baseline active-behavioral coping, baseline natural killer cell activity, and treatment [ie, group intervention]). The stepwise procedure was used for covariate selection.","For control patients, there was a trend for recurrence (13/34) and a statistically significant greater rate of death (10/34) than for experimental patients (7/34 and 3/34, respectively). We found that being male and having a greater Breslow depth predicted greater recurrence and poorer survival. Analysis of multiple covariates found that only Breslow depth and treatment (ie, group intervention) were significant. Adjusting for Breslow depth, treatment effect remained significant. Finally, baseline affective distress and baseline coping were significant psychobehavioral predictors for recurrence and survival. Surprisingly, higher levels of baseline distress as well as baseline coping and enhancement of active-behavioral coping over time were predictive of lower rates of recurrence and death.","Psychiatric interventions that enhance effective coping and reduce affective distress appear to have beneficial effects on survival but are not proposed as an alternative or independent treatment for cancer or any other illness or disease. However, the exact nature of this relationship warrants further investigation."

Cosmetologists received ongoing support, training, and additional culturally aligned educational materials to help them engage their clients in dialogues about the importance of breast cancer early detection. Posters and literature about breast cancer early detection were displayed throughout the salons and cosmetologists used synthetic breast models to show their clients how breast cancer lumps might feel. Participants in the control group received a comparable diabetes education program. Baseline and 6-month follow-up surveys were administered to evaluate changes in women's breast cancer knowledge, attitudes, and screening behaviors.","This intervention was well received by the participants and their cosmetologists and did not interfere with or prolong the client's salon visit. Women in the intervention group reported significantly higher rates of mammography compared to women in the control group. Training a single educator proved sufficient to permeate the entire salon with the health message, and salon clients agreed that cosmetologists could become effective health educators.",Cosmetologists are in an ideal position to increase African American women's breast cancer knowledge and adherence to breast cancer screening guidelines.

Interventions to improve coping skills of caregivers have been shown to be effective with other populations, but their impact has not been assessed in the difficult context of hospice care. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hospice plus a coping skill training intervention improved family caregivers' QOL, burden, coping, and mastery, compared with hospice plus emotional support, and usual hospice care.","A three group randomized controlled trial was conducted including baseline, 16 day, and 30 day assessments conducted from March 1999 to May 2003. The sample consisted of 354 family caregivers of community dwelling hospice patients with advanced cancer. Patient/caregiver dyads were randomly divided into three groups, including a control group (n = 109) who received standard hospice care, a group (n = 109) who received standard hospice care plus three supportive visits, and a group (n = 111) who received standard care plus three visits to teach a coping skills intervention. Primary outcomes included caregiver QOL, caregiver burden due to patient symptoms, caregiver burden due to tasks, and caregiver mastery.","At the 30-day follow-up, the coping skills intervention led to significantly greater improvement in caregiver QOL (estimate = -0.16, standard error [SE] = 0.07, P = 0.03), burden of patient symptoms (estimate = 0.28, SE = 0.07, P &lt; 0.001), and caregiving task burden (estimate = -0.01, SE = 0.01, P = 0.038) than did the other two conditions. None of the groups showed significant change in overall caregiving mastery, caregiver mastery specific to caregiving tasks, problem-focused or emotion-focused coping.","The coping skills intervention was effective in improving caregiver QOL, reducing burden related to patients' symptoms, and caregiving tasks compared with hospice care alone or hospice plus emotional support. Structured caregiver skill-training interventions for caregivers are promising even in the difficult environment of end-of-life care and for families already receiving benefits of hospice care."
454,24467669,To determine if supervised exercise minimises treatment toxicity in patients with prostate cancer initiating androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). This is the first study to date that has investigated the potential role of exercise in preventing ADT toxicity rather than recovering from established toxicities.,"Sixty-three men scheduled to receive ADT were randomly assigned to a 3-month supervised exercise programme involving aerobic and resistance exercise sessions commenced within 10 days of their first ADT injection (32 men) or usual care (31 men). The primary outcome was body composition (lean and fat mass). Other study outcomes included bone mineral density, physical function, blood biomarkers of chronic disease risk and bone turnover, general and prostate cancer-specific quality of life, fatigue and psychological distress. Outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values.","Compared to usual care, a 3-month exercise programme preserved appendicular lean mass (P = 0.019) and prevented gains in whole body fat mass, trunk fat mass and percentage fat with group differences of -1.4\u2009kg (P = 0.001), -0.9\u2009kg (P = 0.008) and -1.3% (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. Significant between-group differences were also seen favouring the exercise group for cardiovascular fitness (peak oxygen consumption 1.1\u2009mL/kg/min, P = 0.004), muscular strength (4.0-25.9\u2009kg, P \u2264 0.026), lower body function (-1.1\u2009s, P &lt; 0.001), total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio (-0.52, P = 0.028), sexual function (15.2, P = 0.028), fatigue (3.1, P = 0.042), psychological distress (-2.2, P = 0.045), social functioning (3.8, P = 0.015) and mental health (3.6-3.8, P \u2264 0.022). There were no significant group differences for any other outcomes.","Commencing a supervised exercise programme involving aerobic and resistance exercise when initiating ADT significantly reduced treatment toxicity, while improving social functioning and mental health. Concurrent prescription of supervised exercise when initiating ADT is therefore advised to minimise morbidity associated with severe hypogonadism."
455,8229121,To evaluate the feasibility of integrating a program based on dietary fat intake reduction into adjuvant treatment strategies for postmenopausal women receiving therapy for early breast cancer.,Two hundred ninety postmenopausal women with localized (stage I to IIIa) breast cancer receiving conventional systemic therapy provided informed consent and were randomized in a multicenter trial to either a dietary intervention group receiving a program of individualized instruction for reducing total fat intake or a dietary control group with minimal dietary counseling.,"Significantly reduced (P &lt; .001) fat intake (in terms of percent calories derived from fat) was observed in the intervention group versus the control group at 3 months (20.3% +/- 2.4% v 31.5% +/- 2.6%, mean +/- SD, respectively) and maintained throughout 24 months of observation. The 50% reduction in daily fat-gram intake (from 66 +/- 23 to 33 +/- 14 g, P &lt; .001) seen at 6 months was associated with reduced saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and linoleic acid (P &lt; .001). Significantly lower body weight was also seen in intervention compared with control patients at all observation periods, resulting in a 3.3-kg weight difference 18 months after randomization (P &lt; .001).",Substantial and sustained dietary fat reduction with associated weight change can be achieved at relatively low cost within the context of conventional multimodality clinical management of postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer. This result supports the feasibility of conducting a full-scale evaluation of the influence of dietary fat intake reduction on the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients.

The aim of this study was to assess whether preoperative inspiratory muscle training (IMT) reduces the rate of pneumonia after oesophagectomy.,"Patients with oesophageal cancer were randomized to a home-based IMT programme before surgery or usual care. IMT included the use of a flow-resistive inspiratory loading device, and patients were instructed to train twice a day at high intensity (more than 60 per cent of maximum inspiratory muscle strength) for 2 weeks or longer until surgery. The primary outcome was postoperative pneumonia; secondary outcomes were inspiratory muscle function, lung function, postoperative complications, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay and physical functioning.","Postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 47 (39\u00b72 per cent) of 120 patients in the IMT group and in 43 (35\u00b75 per cent) of 121 patients in the control group (relative risk 1\u00b710, 95 per cent c.i. 0\u00b779 to 1\u00b753; P\u2009=\u20090\u00b7561).

457,20185972,"Alexithymia is likely to be involved in the pain experience of cancer patients, but the extent to which psychological interventions may modify both pain and alexithymia is unclear.","A group of 52 consecutive cancer patients were enrolled in a 6-month multicomponent psychological intervention trial, and compared to 52 control patients who received standard medical care. Validated scales for pain, alexithymia, coping with disease, illness behavior, psychological distress, and psychosocial functioning were administered at baseline and 6 months later.","Pain was strongly associated with alexithymia and several psychological dimensions. Although at baseline patients in the intervention group had worse psychological and somatic health, at follow-up their level of pain intensity, alexithymia, and somatic concerns had significantly improved compared to control patients. Patients in the intervention group showed dramatic improvements in pain perception, alexithymia, and other psychological variables, while control patients showed an unexpected significant worsening of alexithymia, depression, and adjustment to disease. Multiple regression showed that psychological intervention and alexithymia were both independently associated with the reduction in pain perception.","These findings confirm the close association between alexithymia and pain, and show that multicomponent psychological intervention may significantly reduce both alexithymia and cancer pain. Although the present findings need replication, they should strongly encourage clinicians to provide patients with psychological interventions targeting alexithymic difficulties and helping patients to cope better with both feelings and somatic perception."
458,23733528,"Event-free survival of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Yogyakarta, Indonesia was low (20%). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using a medication diary-book on the treatment outcome of childhood ALL.","A randomized study was conducted with 109 pediatric patients with ALL in a pediatric oncology center in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Both intervention and control groups received a structured parental education program and donated chemotherapy. The intervention group received a medication diary-book to remind parents and families to take oral chemotherapy and present for scheduled appointments or admissions. Event-free survival estimate (EFS) at 3 years was assessed.","Among pediatric patients with ALL with highly educated mothers (senior high school or higher), the EFS-estimate at 3 years of the intervention group was significantly higher than the EFS-estimate at 3 years of the control group (62% vs. 29%, P\u2009=\u20090.04). Among pediatric patients with ALL with low-educated mothers, no significant difference was found in the EFS-estimates at 3 years between the intervention and control group (26% vs. 18%, P\u2009=\u20090.86).","We conclude that a medication diary-book might be useful to improve the survival of pediatric patients with ALL in resource-limited settings, particularly in patients with highly educated mothers."
459,19411787,The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of a cognitive-behavioral nursing intervention on anxiety and depression of patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy.,"A nonequivalent control group design was used for the study. The research participants were patients with breast cancer (N=71; experimental group=35, comparison group=36) who received radiotherapy at P university hospital. The experimental group received a 6-week cognitive-behavioral nursing intervention (2 hr/week), which included nursing counseling, education about treatment choices for breast cancer and possible side effects and management strategies during radiotherapy, and rehabilitation exercise.","Following the intervention, the experimental group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (Experimental group=34.60+/-6.35, Comparison group=44.63+/-9.93, t=3.552, p&lt;.001) and depression (Experimental group=10.20+/-6.61, Comparison group=17.81+/-10.85, t=3.542, p&lt;.001) than the comparison group.","The findings from this study showed that cognitive-behavioral counseling applied by nurses is very effective to reduce anxiety and depression among patients with breast cancer. Therefore, providing nursing counseling to broader spectrum of patients with cancer should be considered. Further research would warrant future clinical application of nursing counseling."
460,20849625,"Competing causes of mortality in the elderly decrease the potential net benefit from colorectal cancer screening and increase the likelihood of potential harms. Individualized decision making has been recommended, so that the elderly can decide whether or not to undergo colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. The objective is to develop and test a decision aid designed to promote individualized colorectal cancer screening decision making for adults age 75 and over.","We used formative research and cognitive testing to develop and refine the decision aid. We then tested the decision aid in an uncontrolled trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who were prepared to make an individualized decision, defined a priori as having adequate knowledge (10/15 questions correct) and clear values (25 or less on values clarity subscale of decisional conflict scale). Secondary outcomes included overall score on the decisional conflict scale, and preferences for undergoing screening.","We enrolled 46 adults in the trial. The decision aid increased the proportion of participants with adequate knowledge from 4% to 52% (p &lt; 0.01) and the proportion prepared to make an individualized decision from 4% to 41% (p &lt; 0.01). The proportion that preferred to undergo CRC screening decreased from 67% to 61% (p = 0. 76); 7 participants (15%) changed screening preference (5 against screening, 2 in favor of screening)","In an uncontrolled trial, the elderly participants appeared better prepared to make an individualized decision about whether or not to undergo CRC screening after using the decision aid."
461,28721886,"A randomized phase II study was performed to measure the potential therapeutic effects of yoga on fatigue, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and overall quality of life (QOL) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy (RT).","The participants were randomized to yoga and no-yoga cohorts (1:1). Twice-weekly yoga interventions were offered throughout the 6- to 9-week courses of RT. Comparisons of standardized assessments were performed between the 2 cohorts for the primary endpoint of fatigue and the secondary endpoints of erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and QOL before, during, and after RT.","From October 2014 to January 2016, 68 eligible PCa patients underwent informed consent and agreed to participate in the study. Of the 68 patients, 18 withdrew early, mostly because of treatment schedule-related time constraints, resulting in 22 and 28 patients in the yoga and no-yoga groups, respectively. Throughout treatment, those in the yoga arm reported less fatigue than those in the control arm, with global fatigue, effect of fatigue, and severity of fatigue subscales showing statistically significant interactions (P&lt;.0001). The sexual health scores (International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire) also displayed a statistically significant interaction (P=.0333). The International Prostate Symptom Score revealed a statistically significant effect of time (P&lt;.0001) but no significant effect of treatment (P=.1022). The QOL measures had mixed results, with yoga having a significant time by treatment effect on the emotional, physical, and social scores but not on functional scores.",A structured yoga intervention of twice-weekly classes during a course of RT was associated with a significant reduction in pre-existing and RT-related fatigue and urinary and sexual dysfunction in PCa patients.
462,29462503,"Cancer patients often report increased stress during chemotherapy. Stress management training has been shown to reduce this adverse outcome, but few interventions exist for Spanish-speaking Hispanic and Latina women (Latinas).","Following community feedback (including focus groups/in-depth interviews), we transcreated the Spanish-Language Self-Administered Stress Management Training (SL-SAT) intervention based on our previously developed and implemented English-based intervention. Latinas about to begin chemotherapy were randomized to SL-SAT (n\u00a0=\u00a0121) or usual care (n\u00a0=\u00a0119). A Spanish-speaking interventionist met with SL-SAT participants who received the SL-SAT toolkit containing instructions in 3 well-established stress management techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery, and use of coping self-statements). Usual care participants received an educational booklet about coping with chemotherapy. All patients were instructed by nurses on their chemotherapy medications and given a resource listing of local support groups. Outcomes were obtained at baseline, and 7 and 13\u00a0weeks after starting chemotherapy. Primary outcomes included anxiety and depression, cancer-related distress, emotional well-being, and spiritual well-being. Secondary outcomes included functional well-being, social/family well-being, physical well-being, symptom severity, and self-efficacy for managing stress. Data were analyzed by using mixed models.","In both groups, improvements were observed in emotional well-being (P\u00a0=\u00a0.01), and declines were observed in functional well-being (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), and physical well-being (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.0001). Symptom severity increased across the follow-up period (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.001).","To be effective, stress management interventions for Latinas receiving chemotherapy may necessitate more attention from an interventionist, delivery of the intervention over a longer interval, and/or a group-based format."
463,25577502,The purpose was to explore operable lung cancer patient experiences with an exercise intervention from a longitudinal perspective according to patient motivation and patient perceived benefits and barriers of exercise.,Nineteen patients enrolled in an exercise intervention 2 weeks post-surgery participated in qualitative interviews at three time points. A criteria sampling strategy was applied. Ricoeur's phenomenological hermeneutical philosophy inspired the analysis.,Patients initiated exercising median 15 days postoperative. Eight patients included in the interview study dropped out of the intervention due to side effects of chemotherapy (n = 3) and external circumstances (n = 5). The mean attendance rate for the eleven participants who completed the intervention was 82 %. No patients experienced severe adverse events. Motivation for participation included patients' expectations of physical benefits and the security of having professionals present. Patients experienced physical and emotional benefits and affirmed their social identity. Barriers were primarily related to side effects of chemotherapy.,The exercise intervention was undertaken safely by operable lung cancer patients initiated 2 weeks after surgery. The intervention put the patients on track to a healthier lifestyle regarding physical activity and smoking. The study indicates that exercise initiated early in the treatment trajectory is beneficial for operable lung cancer patients and especially for those who were physically active and motivated pre-illness and who did not experience side effect of treatment.
464,29305709,"Physical activity can impact the immune system in different ways, e.g. by alteration of the humoral and cellular immune response. Physical activity at medium intensity enhances numbers of cytotoxic T cells, NK cells and macrophages in healthy people. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of endurance and resistance training on the immune system in breast cancer patients during adjuvant chemotherapy.","In a prospective, controlled and randomized intervention exploratory trial, 12-week supervised endurance or resistance training were compared with usual care twice a week. Endpoints were the absolute numbers of the immune cells such as CD3 T lymphocytes including CD4- and CD8, \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, \u03b3\u03b4T cells, CD3/CD16/56 NK cells and CD19 B cells, before and after 12\u00a0weeks of treatment. Cell numbers were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting.","Despite different physical interventions in all groups immune cell count decreased in CD3 T cells including TCR \u03b1\u03b2 and CD4 T cells, NK cells and CD19 B cells 12\u00a0weeks after initiation of chemotherapy and start of the physical intervention program, while the reduction of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and CD8 T cells is less prominent in the RT and UC group.","Chemotherapy led to a decrease in nearly all measured immune cells. In this study, physical intervention with endurance or resistance training did not suppress cellular immunity any further. Larger multicenter trials are needed to evaluate the exact impact of sports intervention on immune cell subpopulations."
465,30374764,To evaluate the potential role of levocarnitine supplementation for cancer-related fatigue in patients treated with sunitinib.,"Patients treated with sunitinib for unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma were enrolled prospectively. Assessment of fatigue in each patient was done using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) questionnaire. Evaluation of fatigue and the serum carnitine level was done at baseline, 2\u00a0weeks, and 4\u00a0weeks after sunitinib therapy was initiated. All patients were treated with sunitinib 37.5\u00a0mg or 50\u00a0mg/day orally, with a 4-week administration and 2-week discontinuation schedule.","Ten patients were finally enrolled in the study. Seven of them had worsened fatigue at the 2-week assessment and levocarnitine was administrated. All these seven patients whose serum carnitine level at 2\u00a0weeks was worse than at the baseline improved after 2-week-L-carnitine supplementation. For six of the seven (85.7%) patients who had L-carnitine supplementation, the BFI score at 4\u00a0weeks decreased compared to that at 2\u00a0weeks, which indicated improvement of fatigue.","Levocarnitine supplementation for cancer-related fatigue in patients treated with sunitinib appears to have a potential benefit. However, further study with a larger number of patients and longer follow-up is crucial to confirm this."
466,9548624,Vitamin E and beta-carotene are considered to decrease the risk of gastric cancer both in humans and in laboratory animals. We studied the effect of dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene on the end-of-trial prevalence of premalignant and malignant lesions of the stomach in older men with atrophic gastritis.,"The study was carried out within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC study) in Finland, in which 29,133 male smokers aged 50-69 years were randomly assigned to receive daily 50 mg alpha-tocopherol, 20 mg beta-carotene, both of these agents, or placebo, for 5-8 years. Serum pepsinogen was determined at base line and after 3 years' supplementation to find men with atrophic gastritis. A low serum pepsinogen I level, indicating atrophic gastritis of the corpus area of the stomach, was found in 2132 men. These men were invited to have upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (gastroscopy), which was performed on 1344 subjects after a median supplementation time of 5.1 years.","Neoplastic alterations were found in 63 of the men (4.7%): 42 with definite dysplasias of low grade (moderate dysplasia), 7 with definite dysplasias of high grade (severe dysplasia), 11 with carcinomas (of which 7 were 'early' cancers), and 3 with carcinoid tumors. Neither alpha-tocopherol (relative risk, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.69) nor beta-carotene (relative risk, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-1.95) supplementation had any association with end-of-trial prevalence of gastric neoplasias after adjustment for other possible risk factors. The effect was not modified by base-line serum level or dietary intake of vitamins, prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, or other covariates.",We thus conclude that supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene for 5 years has no major impact on the occurrence of neoplastic changes of the stomach in older male smokers with atrophic gastritis.
467,16376977,This study evaluated the behavioral impact of a skin cancer prevention program in which health care providers delivered advice and materials to parents of infants over a 3-year period from 1998 to 2001.,"Fourteen offices of a large managed care organization in Colorado were randomly assigned to the intervention or control groups. 728 infants and their parents were recruited within 6 months of birth. At intervention offices, health care providers attended orientation sessions, prompts for delivering sun protection advice were placed in medical records, and parents received sun protection packets at each well-child visit between 2 and 36 months of age.","Based on provider self-report and exit interviews of parents, providers in the intervention group delivered approximately twice as much sun protection advice as providers in the control group. Annual telephone interviews of parents indicated small but statistically significant differences in parent sun protection practices favoring the intervention. Skin exams revealed no significant differences in tanning, freckling, or number of nevi. Behavioral differences between groups appeared to grow over the 3 years of follow-up.","This intervention strategy was successful in increasing the delivery of sun protection advice by health care providers and resulted in changes in parents' behaviors. While the behavioral effect was probably not strong enough to reduce risk for skin cancer, the effect may increase as children age and have more opportunities for overexposure to the sun."
468,22669332,"The antiestrogen, Raloxifene (Ral) is an effective breast cancer chemopreventive agent. Omega-3 fatty acids (n-3FA) may inhibit mammary carcinogenesis. On the basis of their mechanisms of action, we test the hypothesis that a combination of n-3FA and Ral may be superior in reducing select biomarkers of breast cancer risk in women.","Postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer (breast density \u2265 25%) were randomized to: (1) no intervention; (2) Ral 60 mg; (3) Ral 30 mg; (4) n-3FA (Lovaza) 4 g and (5) Lovaza 4 g+Ral 30 mg for 2 years. Reduction in breast density is the primary end point of the study. We report preliminary data on feasibility, compliance and changes in secondary end points related to IGF-I signaling, estrogen metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation in the first group of 46 women who completed 1 year of the study.",All interventions were well tolerated with excellent compliance (96 \u00b1 1% overall) by pill count and also supported by the expected rise in both serum n-3FA and n-3FA/Omega-6 fatty acids (n-6FA) ratio in women randomized to groups 4 and 5 (P&lt;0.05). Lovaza decreased serum triglycerides and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared with control (P&lt;0.05 for both). Ral reduced serum IGF-1 in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.05) while Lovaza did not. Lovaza had no effect on IGF-1 or IGFBP-3. None of the other biomarkers were affected by our treatment.,The combination of Lovaza and Ral is a feasible strategy that may be recommended in future breast cancer chemoprevention trials.
469,11162337,This article describes one outcome of a randomized controlled trial of community action for cancer prevention. The aims of this article were to (a) explore the effectiveness of a community action program in decreasing community smoking rates in rural Australian towns and (b) describe the relationship between adult smoking quit and uptake rates and demographic variables.,"In 1992, 20 towns were selected for randomization. Community action involved formation of community committees and utilization of access point networks to initiate and maintain intervention strategies. At post-test, outcomes were proportion of &quot;quitters&quot; from a cohort of self-described smokers, proportion of &quot;uptakers&quot; from a cohort of self-described nonsmokers, and &quot;net effect.&quot;","Differences in quit rate, uptake rate, and net effect for intervention compared to control condition favored the intervention in all cases, although mainly nonsignificant. Significantly more male smokers quit in intervention towns than in control towns [7.0% (95% CI: 0.6, 13.5)].","Given that CART utilized and improved upon strategies argued as effective in the literature, the limited success of the project in reducing adult smoking, considered in combination with COMMIT findings, suggests the need for further innovation in the field."
470,27833172,"Recently, we described an inverse association between cranberry supplementation and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in patients with negative biopsy for prostate cancer (PCa) and chronic nonbacterial prostatitis. This double blind placebo controlled study evaluates the effects of cranberry consumption on PSA values and other markers in men with PCa before radical prostatectomy.","Prior to surgery, 64 patients with prostate cancer were randomized to a cranberry or placebo group. The cranberry group (n=32) received a mean 30 days of 1500 mg cranberry fruit powder. The control group (n=32) took a similar amount of placebo. Selected blood/urine markers as well as free and total phenolics in urine were measured at baseline and on the day of surgery in both groups. Prostate tissue markers were evaluated after surgery.","The serum PSA significantly decreased by 22.5% in the cranberry arm (n=31, P&lt;0.05). A trend to down-regulation of urinary beta-microseminoprotein (MSMB) and serum gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, as well as upregulation of IGF-1 was found after cranberry supplementation. There were no changes in prostate tissue markers or, composition and concentration of phenolics in urine.",Daily consumption of a powdered cranberry fruit lowered serum PSA in patients with prostate cancer. The whole fruit contains constituents that may regulate the expression of androgen-responsive genes.
471,15869995,"To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of green tea, prescribed as an alternative complementary (CAM) formulation on hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).",Patients with HRCP were prescribed green tea extract capsules at a dose level of 250 mg twice daily. Efficacy and toxicity were evaluated during monthly visits. The primary endpoint was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or measurable disease progression after a minimum of 2 months of therapy.,"Nineteen patients were enrolled into the study. The treatment was generally well tolerated. Twelve patients reported at least one side effect; only two of these were of moderate or severe grade. Primary toxicity was related to gastrointestinal irritation or caffeine intake. Four patients did not complete the minimum 2 months of therapy because of: intolerance (two patients), physician stoppage (one patient), death from cerebrovascular accident (one patient). Fifteen patients completed at least 2 months of therapy. Nine of these patients had progressive disease within 2 months of starting therapy. Six patients developed progressive disease after additional 1 to 4 months of therapy.","Green tea, as CAM therapy, was found to have minimal clinical activity against hormone refractory prostate cancer."
472,18365859,To evaluate the effects of electro-acupuncture (EA) and hormone therapy (HT) on vasomotor symptoms in women with a history of breast cancer.,"Forty-five women were randomized to EA (n = 27) for 12 weeks or HT (n = 18) for 24 months. The number of and distress caused by hot flushes were registered daily before, during and up to 24 months after start of treatment.","In 19 women who completed 12 weeks of EA, the median number of hot flushes/24 h decreased from 9.6 (interquartile range (IQR) 6.6-9.9) at baseline to 4.3 (IQR 1.0-7.1) at 12 weeks of treatment (p &lt; 0.001). At 12 months after start of treatment, 14 women with only the initial 12 weeks of EA had a median number of flushes/24 h of 4.9 (IQR 1.8-7.3), and at 24 months seven women with no other treatment than EA had 2.1 (IQR 1.6-2.8) flushes/24 h. Another five women had a decreased number of flushes after having additional EA. The 18 women with HT had a baseline median number of flushes/24 h of 6.6 (IQR 4.0-8.9), and 0.0 (IQR 0.0-1.6; p = 0.001) at 12 weeks.",Electro-acupuncture is a possible treatment of vasomotor symptoms for women with breast cancer and should be further studied for this group of women.
473,25838249,The time of lung cancer screening may provide the ideal setting to discuss and initiate a smoking cessation plan that includes pharmacologic aids. No studies to date have fully investigated the potential effectiveness of such combined approach.,"We prospectively evaluated the biochemically verified 1-year continuous abstinence rate from smoking of 187 persistent smokers enrolled within the Multicentric Italian Lung Detection Trial (MILD), who received a pharmacologic aid to quit smoking with varenicline along with behavioral counseling. The propensity of study subjects to succeed in smoking cessation was also monitored.","At 12 months, the continuous abstinence rate from smoking was achieved in 37 out of 187 patients (19.8%), with a propensity to succeed in smoking cessation for the assisted attempt equal to 1.43, as compared to an unassisted MILD patient. At the end of the third month of therapy, 48.7% of subjects showed a continuous abstinence rate, while only 33.7% of patients were abstinent from smoking at 6 months. At baseline, the subgroup of MILD participants who were originally allocated to lung tomography showed higher smoking intensity than those allocated to no screening.",A combined smoking cessation intervention can be implemented with satisfactory results within a lung cancer screening program; this preliminary observation needs to be replicated in a prospective investigation. Clinicians should consider that lung cancer screening may be falsely reassuring for persistent smokers; therefore it should always be coupled with a smoking cessation program.
474,29766259,To evaluate the utility of a telephone outcall program for cancer caregivers and to examine longitudinal changes in their distress levels and supportive care needs.,"As part of the PROTECT trial, caregivers assigned to the intervention arm (N\u2009=\u2009108) received three telephone outcalls from a Cancer Council 13 11 20 nurse at three time points (7-10\u00a0days post-randomization, 1 and 4\u00a0months later). During each call, caregivers were screened for distress using the Distress Thermometer (range: 0-10) then six supportive care issues were raised for discussion. Participants completed a utility survey 1\u00a0month post-intervention.","The outcall program was highly acceptable and perceived as beneficial by caregivers. Overall, 95% reported it was worth their time to take part in the outcall program and 82% stated that the program was very relevant to them. Level of distress and impact of distress decreased over time (p\u2009=\u20090.0031, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001, respectively). Average call duration decreased over time (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001) and was longer for female than male caregivers (p\u2009=\u20090.0009). The frequency of caregivers discussing issues related to psychological distress (p\u2009=\u20090.0003), health literacy (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001), financial (p\u2009=\u20090.0014), and practical concerns (p\u2009=\u20090.0121) decreased over time. Psychological distress was more often discussed by female than male caregivers (p\u2009=\u20090.0153), and family issues more often by younger (&lt;\u200955\u00a0years) than older caregivers (p\u2009=\u20090.0071).","Utility of this outcall program was high. Caregivers' level of distress and unmet needs decreased over time. Gender and age differences emerged, which warrants the need for tailored support. Further research is necessary to identify the best method of improving access to 13 11 20 services for caregivers."
475,16921009,"The purpose of this study was to enhance adherence among older (aged 55 years and older) African American men enrolled in a cancer screening trial for prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer. For this study, we defined adherence as completing the trial screenings.",We used a randomized trial design. Case managers contacted intervention group participants (n=352) at least monthly by telephone and provided information and referral services. The control group included 351 participants.,"Among participants with low income, those in the intervention group had higher screening adherence rates than did participants in the control group for (a) prostate-specific antigen test for prostate cancer (74.3% vs 53.0%, p=.001), (b) digital rectal exam for prostate cancer (66.2% vs 46.1%, p=.011), and (c) chest x-ray for lung cancer (70.9% vs 51.3%, p=.012). We found no statistically significant differences in adherence rates for flexible sigmoidoscopy screening for colorectal cancer. In contrast, among participants with moderate-to-high income, we found no statistically significant differences in adherence rates between intervention and control group participants for any of the screening tests.","The case management intervention was effective in enhancing adherence among participants with the lowest income, who in many studies are the most difficult to retain."
476,22271538,To evaluate the efficacy of a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) that is being developed for management of cognitive dysfunction following chemotherapy among breast cancer survivors. Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT) is a brief CBT designed to improve the quality of life and function among cancer survivors with post-chemotherapy cognitive complaints.,"An initial, two-group (MAAT versus waitlist, no treatment control), randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted. Forty stage I and II female breast cancer survivors (mean age = 50; SD = 6.4) were randomized to conditions and assessed at baseline, post-treatment (8 weeks) and 2-month follow-up assessment points on measures of: (1) self-reported daily cognitive failures; (2) quality of life; and (3) neuropsychological performance. Participants were also assessed for satisfaction with MAAT.","With education and IQ as covariates, MAAT participants made significant improvements relative to controls on the spiritual well-being subscale of the quality of life measure and on verbal memory, but statistical significance was not achieved on self-report of daily cognitive complaints. However, moderate-to-large effect sizes were observed on these outcomes. Participants gave MAAT high satisfaction ratings.","Although this initial RCT is a small study, MAAT participants appear to improve on one measure of quality of life and verbal memory performance relative to no treatment controls and rate MAAT with high satisfaction. These data are encouraging and support the continued development and evaluation of MAAT efficacy."
477,18251162,"Vitamin K2 (VK2) appears to have a potent inhibitory activity for cell growth including HCC cells. We investigated whether VK2 could reduce incidence of tumor recurrence after treatment of HCC. Forty-five patients with cured or possibly cured HCC were randomly selected, assigning patients to treatment (n=21) or control group (n=24) with randomization list.","For the treatment group, forty-five mg of Glakay was given orally every day after therapy for HCC. No patients complained of adverse effects. Abdominal ultrasonography and dynamic CT were performed at 3-month intervals. Recurrence was confirmed by abdominal angiography.","Recurrence of HCC occurred in 7 cases (33.3%) for the treatment group and 12 cases (50.0%) for the control group during mean observation periods of 19.5 and 16.5 months, respectively. Administration of VK2 was not an independent variable for the recurrence on univariate analysis. Cumulative incidence of HCC recurrence did not differ between the two groups, and the cumulative survival rate tended to be high in treatment group (p =0.054). Cox regression analysis revealed that serum albumin concentration alone was an independent factor affecting the recurrence.",These findings suggest that VK2 does not appear to prevent recurrence of HCC after curative treatment. Our study is preliminary and large-scale trials are needed to determine whether VK2 is of benefit to decrease the recurrence of HCC.
478,22897760,"To describe the development of the content and pilot testing of a radiation therapist-led educational intervention for breast cancer patients about to commence radiotherapy. Pilot testing consisted of testing the intervention for appropriateness, feasibility and acceptance.","A tailored intervention consisting of two face-to-face meetings with a radiation therapist (one before radiation planning, the other before treatment) was developed using Level I evidence for preparing patients for potentially threatening procedures. Training of intervention radiation therapists consisted of two communication skills workshops. Radiation therapists' consultations were tape-recorded and analyzed. The feasibility of the intervention was assessed by response rates and feedback from patients and radiation therapists. Patients completed surveys at baseline and following each intervention delivery. The main outcome measures were anxiety and depression, patient concerns and knowledge about radiotherapy.",Response rates were considered acceptable. Twelve patients were enrolled and completed baseline measures. Nine patients completed follow-up measures following the second consultation. Preliminary results showed a trend for a decrease in anxiety and depression levels following the first consultation. There was also a decrease in concerns about radiotherapy and an increase in patients' knowledge. The instruments showed variability at baseline and discriminated between different responses over time. Radiation therapists adhered to providing the interventions. Interviews with radiation therapists and patients demonstrated that the intervention was feasible and acceptable.,This pilot study demonstrated that this new intervention is both feasible and acceptable to radiation therapists and patients. The intervention is now being assessed using a randomized controlled trial.
479,11879860,Doctors' communication with patients is commonly hampered by lack of training in this core skill. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an intensive 3-day training course on communication skills in a randomised controlled trial with a two-by-two factorial design and several outcomes.,"160 oncologists from 34 UK cancer centres were randomly allocated to four groups: written feedback followed by course; course alone; written feedback alone; and control. At each of two assessment periods, consultations with six to ten consecutive, consenting patients per doctor were videotaped. 2407 patients participated. Outcome measures included objective and subjective ratings made by researchers, doctors, and patients. The primary outcomes were objective improvements after the intervention in key communication skills. Course content included structured feedback, videotape review of consultations, role-play with simulated patients, interactive group demonstrations, and discussion led by a trained facilitator.","In Poisson regression analysis of counts of communication behaviours, course attendance significantly improved key outcomes. The estimated effect sizes corresponded to higher rates of use of focused questions (difference between course attenders [n=80] and non-attenders [n=80] 34%, p=0.003), focused and open questions (27%, p=0.005), expressions of empathy (69%, p=0.003), and appropriate responses to patients' cues (38%, p=0.026), and a 24% lower rate of use of leading questions (p=0.11). There was little evidence for the effectiveness of written feedback.",The communication problems of senior doctors working in cancer medicine are not resolved by time and clinical experience. This trial shows that training courses significantly improve key communication skills. More resources should be allocated to address doctors' training needs in this vital area.
480,16421661,Recent studies have shown that the type 1/2 CD4+ T cell (Th1/Th2) balance shifts toward Th2 dominance in cancer-bearing state or by surgical stress. Perioperative immunonutrition is reported to improve the outcome in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. This study was designed to investigate whether preoperative immunonutrition corrects the impaired Th1/Th2 balance in the perioperative period.,"Thirty-six patients with colorectal cancer were prospectively divided into two groups as follows: preoperative oral intake supplementation with a formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids and ribonucleic acid for five days (supplemented group; n = 19); and (control group; n = 17). Blood sampling was performed before supplementation, on the morning of surgery, and 3, 7, and 14 days postoperatively. The proportions of CD4+ T cells producing intracellular cytokines (interferon-gamma and interleukin-4) were measured by flow cytometry.","In the preoperative period, the proportions of CD4+ T cells producing interleukin-4 significantly decreased and Th1/Th2 ratio significantly increased on the morning of surgery compared with those before supplementation. In the postoperative period, the proportions of CD4+ T cells producing interferon-gamma in both groups maintained the preoperative level. The proportions of CD4+ T cells producing interleukin-4 in the control group showed a gradual increase from the preoperative level, which implies Th2 dominant shift. In contrast, the supplemented group maintained the preoperative level of Th1/Th2 ratio.",Preoperative immunonutrition corrects impaired Th1/Th2 balance in both cancer-bearing state and the postoperative period. This correction may be one of the important determinants of the clinical benefits of immunonutrition.
481,15261895,"Body and Soul was a collaborative effort among two research universities, a national voluntary agency (American Cancer Society), and the National Institutes of Health to disseminate and evaluate under real-world conditions the impact of previously developed dietary interventions for African Americans.","Body and Soul was constructed from two successful research-based interventions conducted in African-American churches. Components deemed essential from the prior interventions were combined, and then tested in a cluster randomized-effectiveness trial. The primary outcome was fruit and vegetable intake measured with two types of food frequency questionnaires at baseline and 6-month follow-up.","At the 6-month follow-up, intervention participants showed significantly greater fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake relative to controls. Post-test differences were 0.7 and 1.4 servings for the 2-item and 17-item F&amp;V frequency measures, respectively. Statistically significant positive changes in fat intake, motivation to eat F&amp;V, social support, and efficacy to eat F&amp;V were also observed.","The results suggest that research-based interventions, delivered collaboratively by community volunteers and a health-related voluntary agency, can be effectively implemented under real-world conditions."
482,17389534,Many clinicians lack resources to engage patients in shared decision making for prostate cancer screening. We sought to evaluate whether previsit educational decision aids facilitate shared decision making.,"This randomized controlled study compared a Web-based and a paper-based decision aid with no previsit education. Men aged 50 to 70 years undergoing a health maintenance examination at a large family practice were enrolled. The primary outcome was patient-reported level of control over the decision to be screened. Secondary outcomes included frequency of screening, patient knowledge, decisional conflict, and time spent discussing screening.","A total of 497 men participated (75 control, 196 brochure, 226 Web site). Patients exposed to either aid were no more likely than control patients to report a collaborative decision: 36% of patients in each group reported equally sharing decision responsibility. Exposure to either decision aid increased patients' involvement in decision making compared with the control condition (Web site, P = .03; brochure, P = .03). Only 46% of control patients reported an active decision-making role, compared with 56% of Web site and 54% of brochure patients. Patients exposed to a decision aid answered a greater percentage of knowledge questions correctly (54% control vs 69% Web site, P &lt;.001, and vs 69% brochure, P &lt;.001) and were less likely to be screened (94% control vs 86% Web site, P = .06, and vs 85% brochure, P = .04).","Patients in the decision aid groups were more informed and more engaged in the screening decision than their control counterparts. Exposure did not promote shared decision-making control, however. Whether shared decision making is the ideal model and how to measure its occurrence are subjects for further research."
483,22498220,Epidemiological and biological evidence suggests a preventive effect of selenium and vitamin E on bladder cancer. We assessed the effect of selenium and/or vitamin E on bladder cancer development.,"This was a secondary analysis of the randomized, placebo controlled SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial), which included 34,887 men randomly assigned to 4 groups (selenium, vitamin E, selenium plus vitamin E and placebo) in double-blind fashion between August 22, 2001 and June 24, 2004. The primary end point was bladder cancer incidence, as determined by routine clinical management.","During a median followup of 7.1 years (IQR 6.4-8.0) 224 bladder cancer cases were recorded. Patients with bladder cancer were older, and more likely to be white and have a smoking history than those without bladder cancer. Most cancers were urothelial and nonmuscle invasive. There was no significant difference in the bladder cancer incidence between the 53 men in the placebo group and the 56 in the vitamin E group (HR 1.05, IQR 0.64-1.73, p=0.79), the 60 in the selenium group (HR 1.13, 0.70-1.84, p=0.52) or the 55 in the vitamin E plus selenium group (HR 1.05, 0.63-1.70, p=0.86).","This secondary analysis showed no preventive effect of selenium or vitamin E alone or combined on bladder cancer in this population of men. Further studies are needed to assess the effect in women, and at different doses and formulations."
484,16904524,To determine the effectiveness of a multicomponent clinical intervention to reduce pain in outpatients with cancer.,"Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive either a clinical intervention including an information session, the use of a pain diary, and the possibility to contact a physician to adjust the pain medication, or the usual treatment of pain by the staff radiation oncologist. All patients reported their average and worst pain levels at baseline and 2 and 3 weeks after the start of the intervention.","The study groups were similar with respect to their baseline characteristics and pain levels at randomization. After 3 weeks, the average and worst pain experienced by patients randomized to the clinical intervention group was significantly inferior to the average pain experienced by patients in the control group (2.9/10 vs. 4.4/10 and 4.2/10 vs. 5.5/10, respectively). Results showed that the experimental group patients decreased their pain levels more than the control group patients did over time.","An intervention including patient education, a pain diary, and defining a procedure for therapeutic adjustments can be effective to improve pain relief in outpatients with cancer."
485,12430637,Southeast Asian women have low levels of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing participation. We conducted a group-randomized controlled trial to evaluate a cervical cancer screening intervention program targeting Seattle's Cambodian refugee community.,"Women who completed a baseline, community-based survey were eligible for the trial. Neighborhoods were the unit of randomization. Three hundred and seventy survey participants living in 17 neighborhoods were randomized to intervention or control status. Intervention group women received home visits by outreach workers and were invited to group meetings in neighborhood settings. The primary outcome measure was self-reported Pap testing in the year prior to completing a follow-up survey.",The proportion of women in the intervention group reporting recent cervical cancer screening increased from 44% at baseline to 61% at follow-up (+17%). The corresponding proportions among the control group were 51 and 62% (+11%). These temporal increases were statistically significant in both the intervention (P &lt; 0.001) and control (P = 0.027) groups.,"This study was unable to document an increase in Pap testing use specifically in the neighborhood-based outreach intervention group; rather, we found an increase in both intervention and control groups. A general awareness of the project among women and their health care providers as well as other ongoing cervical cancer screening promotional efforts may all have contributed to increases in Pap testing rates."
486,22831916,The goal of this pilot study was to determine the magnitude and direction of intervention effect sizes for inflammatory-related serum markers and relevant health outcomes among breast cancer survivors (BCSs) receiving a physical activity behavior change intervention compared with usual care.,"This randomized controlled trial enrolled 28 stage I, II, or IIIA BCSs who were post-primary treatment and not regular exercisers. Participants were assigned to either a 3-month physical activity behavior change intervention group (ING) or usual care group (UCG). Intervention included supervised aerobic (150 weekly minutes, moderate-intensity) and resistance (2 sessions per week) exercise that gradually shifted to home-based exercise. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 months.","Cardiorespiratory fitness significantly improved in the ING versus the UCG (between-group difference = 3.8 mL/kg/min; d = 1.1; P = .015). Self-reported sleep latency was significantly reduced in the ING versus the UCG (between group difference = -0.5; d = -1.2; P = .02) as was serum leptin (between-group difference = -9.0 ng/mL; d = -1.0; P = .031). Small to medium nonsignificant negative effect sizes were noted for interleukin (IL)-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and ratios of IL-6 to IL-10, IL-8 to IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1 to IL-10, whereas nonsignificant positive effect sizes were noted for IL-6 and high-molecular-weight adiponectin.","Physical activity behavior change interventions in BCSs can achieve large effect size changes for several health outcomes. Although effect sizes for inflammatory markers were often small and not significant, changes were in the hypothesized direction for all except IL-6 and IL-10."
487,30572473,This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of nerve electrical stimulation (NES) for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC).,"One hundred twenty-four eligible patients with AGC were included in this randomized controlled trial. They were equally divided the NES group and the sham group. The patients in the NES group received NES intervention, while the subjects in the sham group underwent sham NES. The primary outcome included symptoms severity and appetite. The secondary outcomes included quality of life, as measured by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) score, and functional impairment, as evaluated by the Karnofsky score. Additionally, adverse events were also documented during the period of the treatment.","After treatment, NES showed greater effectiveness in reducing the severity of nausea (P\u200a=\u200a.02), and vomiting (P\u200a=\u200a.04), as well as the appetite improvement (P\u200a=\u200a.02), compared with the sham NES. Furthermore, no adverse events related to NES treatment were detected.",The results of this study demonstrated that NES may help to relieve CINV in patients with AGC. Future studies are still needed to warrant these results.
488,30138152,The aims of the study were to evaluate the effect of a community outreach worker (promotora)-led high-intensity educational intervention compared with control without promotora-led intervention on cervical cancer screening preference (Pap smear vs self-sampling) and to determine the effect of this preference on subsequent screening completion.,"This randomized controlled trial compared the effect of educational intervention on women's preferences for self-sampling for human papillomavirus. Inclusion criteria were women aged 30 to 65 years and no cervical cancer screening in 3 years or more. Community-based study with intervention group receiving culturally tailored education by promotora vs control group who received written education pamphlet. We evaluated participants' test preference, knowledge, and Pap completion at 12-months postintervention.","Two hundred one predominantly Hispanic women were randomly assigned to high-intensity (n = 100) education vs low-intensity education (n = 101). The mean age was 46.4 years (SD = 8.2 years). There was no difference in test preference between high- and low-intensity groups (49% vs 41%, both tests equally; 28.6% vs 35.1%, self-sampling; and 22% vs 23%, Pap, p = .536). High-intensity intervention resulted in a significantly higher self-sampling acceptability score (25.02 vs 24.06, p = .039).Testing preference did not significantly affect Pap completion (Pap vs self-sampling vs unsure/both equally, 60.0% vs 43.6% vs 48.9%, p = 0.24). Human papillomavirus knowledge was found to be significantly associated with completion of Pap at 12 months. Human papillomavirus-positive result on self-sampling trended toward increased likelihood of screening completion (16.3% vs 7.8%, p = .058).",We found a high level of acceptability of self-sampling regardless of intensity of education in a largely Hispanic female population living on the US-Mexico border and a trend toward increased Pap smear follow-up in participants who tested positive.
489,19626443,To examine predictors of exercise adherence in breast cancer survivors.,"Seventy-five breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to exercise (n = 37) or usual care (n = 38). Demographic, prognostic, physiologic, and psychosocial information was collected at baseline and 6 months. The exercise goal was 30 min of exercise 5 days/week for 6 months.","Women randomized to exercise participated in moderate-intensity recreational exercise for 123 +/- 52 min/week (81% of the prescribed 150 min/week) over 6 months. Baseline variables associated with better adherence were lower body mass index (BMI), smaller waist circumference, higher amounts of physical activity 6 months prior to enrollment, being in the preparation vs. contemplation Stage of Change and higher FACT-B breast cancer subscale score. After adjusting for these variables, lower BMI and higher Stage of Change continued to be associated with better adherence (p &lt; 0.05).","Future studies of exercise and breast cancer prognosis should target obese women for participation, as well as women just beginning to contemplate participation and its benefits after a cancer diagnosis."
490,25845088,To determine whether exercise training might exert anti-inflammatory effect by reducing HMGB1 levels in women with breast cancer (BC).,"We analyzed monocentric data from the DIANA (DIET AND ANDROGENS)-5 PROJECT. Study population consisted of 94 patients randomized into two groups: 61 patients (53 +/- 8 yrs, training group) were assigned to a structured exercise training intervention (3 times/week for the first 3 months, and once /week for the following 9 months); whereas 33 patients (52 +/- 7 yrs, control group) followed only the general indications to adhere to the life-style intervention suggestions of the DIANA protocol. At study entry and after 12 months, all patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing, biochemical as- sessment [HMGB1, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6)]; and lipid and glycemic profile.","There were no significant differences between groups in baseline clinical and inflammatory profile. Among the training group, only 19/61 patients had high adherence to the exercise intervention. After stratifying the study population according to the level of adhesion to the exer- cise intervention, 1-year HMGB1 levels were lower among patients more adherent to exercise (p for trend = 0.001). Further adjusting for age, body mass index and baseline values, 1-year HMGB1 levels remained significantly and inversely associated to the level of adhesion to the exercise intervention (B = -0.97, SE = 0.43, p = 0.01).","Moderate intensity exercise training in BC survivors is associated with reduced HMGB1 levels that are proportional to the level of adhesion to the exercise intervention, independently from other classical inflammatory molecules, suggesting an exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effect mediated by HMGB1."
491,17851864,"Cancer rehabilitation programs mainly involve endurance training, and little attention is paid to strength training. Cancer survivors are generally advised to train at much lower workloads than the standard guidelines for strength training suggest. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an 18-week high-intensity strength training program in cancer survivors.","Fifty-seven patients (age 24 to 73 years) who had received chemotherapy for lymphomas, breast, gynecologic, testicular, or colorectal cancer completed the program. Outcome measures were changes in muscular strength (one-repetition maximum), cardiopulmonary function (VO2 max), maximal short exercise capacity (MSEC), body composition and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) between baseline and follow-up.","The high-intensity strength training was well tolerated by all patients. Significant improvements in muscle strength were found, with effect sizes varying from 1.32 to 2.68. VO2 max increased significantly by 10% in men and by 13% in women. Different functional scales of HRQOL improved (p &lt; 0.01), with effect sizes varying from 0.47 to 0.82. Muscle strength correlated significantly with physical functioning before and after the training program.","We conclude that a supervised, high-intensity strength training program seems to be an effective means to improve muscle strength, cardiopulmonary function, and HRQOL and should be incorporated in cancer rehabilitation programs. Further randomized trials are needed to confirm the results."
492,14615440,"During the last 30 years, auricular acupuncture has been used as complementary treatment of cancer pain when analgesic drugs do not suffice. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of auricular acupuncture in decreasing pain intensity in cancer patients.","Ninety patients were randomly divided in three groups; one group received two courses of auricular acupuncture at points where an electrodermal signal had been detected, and two placebo groups received auricular acupuncture at points with no electrodermal signal (placebo points) and one with auricular seeds fixed at placebo points. Patients had to be in pain, attaining a visual analog score (VAS) of 30 mm or more after having received analgesic treatment adapted to both intensity and type of pain, for at least 1 month of therapy. Treatment efficacy was based on the absolute decrease in pain intensity measured 2 months after randomization using the VAS.","The main outcome was pain assessed at 2 months, with the assessment at 1 month carried over to 2 months for the eight patients who interrupted treatment after 1 month. For three patients, no data were available because they withdrew from the study during the first month. Pain intensity decreased by 36% at 2 months from baseline in the group receiving acupuncture; there was little change for patients receiving placebo (2%). The difference between groups was statistically significant (P &lt;.0001).","The observed reduction in pain intensity measured on the VAS represents a clear benefit from auricular acupuncture for these cancer patients who are in pain, despite stable analgesic treatment."

495,8174878,"Fatty acids and bile acids are tumor promoters of experimental colon cancer in rats. Calcium can inhibit their effects. After intestinal bypass (IB), fecal bile acid and lipid levels increase markedly. In rats, IB increases colonic cell proliferation and carcinogen-induced colon tumor incidence. Whether fecal bile acids and lipids influence rectal epithelial proliferation in humans is uncertain. This study compared rectal epithelial proliferation in IB subjects and in controls matched for age, sex, and body mass index and investigated the effects of calcium carbonate supplementation (2400 or 3600 mg Ca2+/day for 12 weeks) on proliferation indices in IB subjects.","Epithelial proliferation was studied by in vitro incubation of rectal biopsy specimens with [3H] thymidine. Twenty-four-hour stool collections were assayed for bile acids, lipids, and calcium.",Whole crypt labeling index (LI) and upper crypt LI were increased in IB subjects compared with controls (P &lt; 0.005).

Fifty-eight percent of employees returned FFQs.","At 1 year, there were modest but statistically significant intervention effects for fat (-0.9 %en), fiber (+0.5 g/1,000 kcal), and fruits/vegetables (+0.2 servings/day) (all P &lt; 0.007). At 2 years, due to significant positive changes in control worksites, intervention effects were smaller, significant for fiber only. Intervention effects were larger in younger (&lt;50 years), active employees and class attendees.",The nutrition intervention produced significant but modest effects on dietary fat and fiber and fruits/vegetables in these high-risk employees. Age and dose effects suggest younger employees may be more responsive to this intervention.
497,10770980,"The risks of colorectal cancer and adenoma, the precursor lesion, are believed to be influenced by dietary factors. Epidemiologic evidence that cereal fiber protects against colorectal cancer is equivocal. We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether dietary supplementation with wheat-bran fiber reduces the rate of recurrence of colorectal adenomas.","We randomly assigned 1429 men and women who were 40 to 80 years of age and who had had one or more histologically confirmed colorectal adenomas removed within three months before recruitment began to a supervised program of dietary supplementation with either high amounts (13.5 g per day) or low amounts (2 g per day) of wheat-bran fiber. The primary end point was the presence or absence of new adenomas at the time of follow-up colonoscopy. Subjects and physicians, including colonoscopists, were unaware of the group assignments.","Of the 1303 subjects who completed the study, 719 had been randomly assigned to the high-fiber group and 584 to the low-fiber group.

501,14972467,To determine whether supplemental amounts of soy isoflavone (genistein-rich extract) would lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels more than 50% in patients with prostate cancer (CaP).,"A total of 62 men (mean age 73.6 years, range 61.4 to 89.3) with histologically proven CaP who had two consecutive elevated PSA readings were accrued during a 13-month period. An open-label pilot study was conducted for 6 months in which the patients took capsules containing the genistein-rich extract three times daily by mouth. The subjects were in one of five groups: after radical retropubic prostatectomy (n = 9), after radiotherapy (n = 17), after both radical retropubic prostatectomy and radiotherapy (n = 6), off-cycle during hormonal therapy (intermittent hormones; n = 14), or active surveillance (n = 16). The primary endpoint for the trial was a 50% reduction in the PSA level at 6 months compared with before treatment.","Of the 62 men enrolled, 52 were available for evaluation at 6 months. Three patients discontinued because of adverse events (diarrhea) and seven because of personal choice. One of 52 patients had a more than 50% reduction in the PSA level (1.9% response, 95% confidence interval 0.1% to 10.3%). An additional 7 patients had PSA reductions that were less than 50%. All 8 patients with lower PSA levels at 6 months were in the active surveillance (watchful waiting) treatment subgroup. Repeated measure regression models allowing for correlation between initial levels and change also indicated a decline in PSA in this group compared with other groups: 0 of 52 had a complete response, 9 (17%) had a partial response, 8 (15%) had stable disease, and 35 (67%) had disease progression. In the 9 patients with a partial response, 6 had pathologic findings that were moderately differentiated, 2 had well-differentiated findings, and 1 had poorly differentiated findings. Therefore, the response in this group of patients did not appear to be driven by the Gleason score. The total testosterone level was lowered in one of the patients responding, but it was higher in five others.","A genistein-rich extract as the sole treatment for CaP did not reduce PSA levels by 50% or more in 51 of 52 subjects. Thus, it does not appear to be an effective treatment for CaP when given alone. However, 8 of 13 evaluated patients in the active surveillance group had either no rise or a decline in PSA levels of less than 50%. More study is warranted for those choosing active surveillance."
502,15800312,To design and test a geriatric educational intervention to improve accrual of cancer patients age 65 years and older to cooperative group-sponsored treatment trials.,Main member institutions of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and its affiliates were randomly assigned to receive standard information (n = 73) or educational intervention (n = 53). Standard information included CALGB Web site access and periodic notification about existing trials. The geriatric educational intervention included standard information plus: (1) an educational seminar; (2) educational materials; (3) a list of available protocols for use on charts; (4) a monthly e-mail and mail reminders for 1 year; and (5) a case discussion seminar. The main outcome was percentage of accrual of older persons to phase II and III treatment protocols after study initiation compared with baseline.,"There were 3,032 patients entered onto trials in the baseline year, and 2,160 and 1,239 during the 2 years postintervention, respectively. Overall percentage of accrual of older patients was 37% at baseline, and 33% and 31% during the first and second years after intervention. There was no improvement in accrual in the intervention versus control arm: 36% v 32% in the first year and 31% v 31% in the second year.","Accrual of older patients was not increased by this intervention. Reasons for lack of effect include low intervention intensity, high baseline accrual rates, and closure of several high-accruing protocols during the study. More intense and multifaceted approaches will be needed to change physician (and patient) behavior and to increase accrual of older persons to clinical trials."

504,11241253,"Calcium supplements to the western-style diet may reduce the risk for colorectal neoplasia. Using rectal epithelial proliferation (REP) measurements as a biomarker of response to intervention, the authors evaluated the effects of 1-year calcium supplementation in adenoma patients and its possible interactions with the patients' dietary and lifestyle habits.","Consenting adenoma patients, without a family history of colorectal neoplasia, were randomly selected to receive 3.75 g calcium carbonate (1.5 g Ca2+) daily or to receive no treatment. All had their long-term dietary and lifestyle habits assessed and their REP labeling index (LI) evaluated before and at end of follow-up. The change in LI was compared between groups, and statistical associations were examined between mean nutrient consumption and treatment effect and between lifestyle and treatment effect.","Fifty-two adenoma patients (33 treated and 19 untreated) completed intervention and follow-up. There were no significant differences between study groups in age, weight, cigarette smoking, or medication use. The LI decreased in 58% of calcium-intervened patients and in only 26% of nonintervened patients (P = 0.04); the mean LI x 100 (+/- standard deviation) of the former fell from 5.04 +/- 1.93 to 4.54 +/- 1.58, and rose from 4.32 +/- 1.58 to 4.93 +/- 1.58 in the latter (P = 0.04). A lower fat, a higher carbohydrate, fiber, or fluid intake each interacted with the calcium supplementation to decrease the LI (P = 0.02, 0.001, 0.02, and 0.08, respectively).","Long-term calcium supplements significantly suppressed REP in adenoma patients, and long-term dietary habits contributed to this effect. Patient diet should be assessed when researchers use REP as a biomarker in calcium chemoprevention studies. Study results indicated that relevant dietary counseling may be useful in addition to calcium supplements in persons at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia."
505,15452189,"Cognitive-existential group therapy (CEGT) was developed to improve mood and mental attitude toward cancer in women with early-stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Given the debate about group therapy's association with increased survival in women with metastatic breast cancer, we were curious to check its effect at a much earlier stage in the cancer journey.",We randomly assigned 303 women with early-stage breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy to either 20 sessions of weekly group therapy plus three relaxation classes (n = 154) or to a control condition of three relaxation classes alone (n = 149). The primary outcome was survival.,"CEGT did not extend survival; the median survival time was 81.9 months (95% CI, 64.8 to 99.0 months) in the group-therapy women and 85.5 months (95% CI, 67.5 to 103.6 months) in the control arm. The hazard ratio for death was 1.35 (95% CI, 0.76 to 2.39; P = .31). In contrast, histology and axillary lymph node status were significant predictors of survival. Low-grade histology yielded a hazard ratio of 0.342 (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.69), and axillary lymph node-negative status yielded a hazard ratio of 0.397 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.78).",CEGT does not prolong survival in women with early-stage breast cancer.
506,8145782,"Actinic keratoses are premalignant lesions and are a sensitive and important manifestation of sun-induced skin damage. Studies in animals have shown that dietary fat influences the incidence of sun-induced skin cancer, but the effect of diet on the incidence of actinic keratosis in humans is not known.","We randomly assigned 76 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer either to continue their usual diet (control group) or to eat a diet with 20 percent of total caloric intake as fat (dietary-intervention group). For 24 months, the patients were examined for the presence of new actinic keratoses by physicians unaware of their assigned diets.","At base line, the mean (+/- SD) percentage of caloric intake as fat was 40 +/- 4 percent in the control group and 39 +/- 3 percent in the dietary-intervention group. After 4 months of dietary therapy the percentage of calories as fat had decreased to 21 percent in the dietary-intervention group, and it remained below this level throughout the 24-month study period. The percentage of calories as fat in the control group did not fall below 36 percent at any time.

507,15260388,Turmeric extract and turmeric oil have shown chemoprotective effect against chemically-induced malignancies in experimental animals. They can reverse precancerous changes in oral submucous fibrosis in humans. The use of turmeric or Curcuma longa Linn as a spice and household remedy has been known to be safe for centuries. In view of the long term administration required for cancer prevention a Phase I clinical trial of turmeric oil (TO) was designed to study the safety and tolerance of TO in volunteers for a period of 3 months.,"Nine healthy volunteers between 20 and 33 years of age were tested for haemoglobin, blood counts, liver and kidney functions, bleeding and clotting time and serum electrolytes initially and at 1 and 3 months of treatment. They were administered 0.6 ml of TO three times a day for 1 month and 1 ml in 3 divided doses for 2 months. The acute tolerability study on Day 1 was conducted in a Clinical Pharmacology daycare Unit. Blood pressure and pulse were recorded frequently on Day 1 and at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours and fortnightly till 12 weeks. Volunteers were daily supervised for TO intake as well as for any side effects throughout the study period.","Nine volunteers were enrolled for the study. One discontinued on 3rd day for allergic skin rashes which, on discontinuation of TO, gradually disappeared by two weeks. Another discontinued on 7th day for intercurrent fever requiring antibiotic treatment. Seven volunteers completed the study. There was no effect of TO, in two doses, on pulse and blood pressure and no side effects in acute tolerability study on Day 1. There was no effect of TO intake on weight, blood pressure, symptoms and signs upto 12 weeks. There was no clinical, haematological, renal or hepatic-toxicity of TO at 1 month and 3 months. Serum lipids did not show significant change except in one volunteer (reversible).","In view of the potential for reversing oral submucous fibrosis, a precancerous condition for oral cancer, TO, can be recommended directly for a Phase II trial in patients."

509,19967490,"UFT is composed of tegafur, a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, and uracil, at a fixed ratio of 1: 4. UFT is widely used with leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer. As reported, UFT/leucovorin should not be taken simultaneously with food because a high fat content will reduce the systemic exposure to the active cytotoxic moiety of UFT. In this single-dose, randomized, two-way crossover study, we investigated the effects of a low-fat Japanese meal on the pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of UFT (2 x 100-mg capsules; dose in terms of tegafur) and leucovorin (1 x 25-mg tablet).","Patients (n = 12) were randomly assigned to receive both drugs after an overnight fast or 5 min after eating a standard Japanese breakfast (641 kcal), with a 3-day washout period between treatments. Pharmacokinetics (n = 12) were determined for tegafur, 5-fluorouracil, uracil, leucovorin, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (an active metabolite of leucovorin).","For 5-fluorouracil pharmacokinetics, the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the curve were reduced by 73.7% and 47.4%, respectively, when UFT was taken postprandially, and the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the curve for uracil were reduced by 84.1% and 68.9%, respectively, compared with dosing on an empty stomach. These decreases in the systemic exposure to 5-fluorouracil were quite marked and may have an impact on its antitumor effect.",A low-fat meal affects the pharmacokinetics of UFT similarly to a high-fat meal.
510,19548447,To observe and compare the quality of life (QOL) and survival time in patients with advanced primary hepatic cancer (PHC) after they have been treated by the combination of ganji recipe and interventional therapy with Fructus Bruceae Oil Emulsion (FBE) or by the trans-hepatic arterial chemical embolization (TACE) adopting Seldinger's technique.,"Seventy-seven patients with advanced PHC were randomly assigned to two groups, 37 patients in the control group treated with TACE alone, and 40 in the treatment group with the combined therapy. One therapeutic course was 4 weeks, and the intervention therapy was repeated generally after an interval of 4-6 weeks according to patients'condition ,the average intervention frequency was 2.3 for one case. The QOL and the survival time in patients were evaluated after treatment.","Significant difference was shown in the changes of the Karnofsky score between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). The scores suggested that the improvements in the treatment group, including patients'physical energy enhancing, symptoms alleviating and overall QOL improving, were superior to those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). No significant difference of the 3-month survival rate between the two groups was found (P &gt; 0.05), but the 0.5- and 1-year survival rate were significantly superior in the treatment group to those in the control group (67.6% vs. 42.4% and 38.2% vs. 16.1%, respectively). The median survival time in the two groups was 8.9 and 5.3 months respectively.","Combination of ganji recipe and interventional therapy with FBE in treating PHC could improve patients' QOL, raise the 0.5- and 1-year survival rate, and prolong the survival time, suggesting TCM treatment has an affirmative significance for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and improving the prognosis in patients."
511,12575569,To explore the effect of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) combined with bronchial arterial infusion chemotherapy (BAIC).,"Patients with moderate or advanced NSCLC were randomly divided into two groups, the 39 patients in the treated group treated with CHM plus BAIC therapy and 37 in the control group treated with BAIC alone. The short-term therapeutic effect, long-term survival rate, changes of clinical principal symptoms, quality of life and peripheral blood pictures in the two groups were observed and compared.","After treatment the rate of CR + PR + NC in the treated and the control group was 92.31% and 70.27% respectively, the inter-group comparison showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05). The 0.5-, 1- and 2-year survival rate in the treated group was 79.49%, 56.41% and 51.28% respectively and in the control group, 72.97%, 51.35% and 24.32% respectively. The 2-year survival rate in the former was better than that in the latter (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the improvement of clinical symptoms, Karnofsky scoring, body weight and peripheral blood picture in the treated group was superior to that in the control group.",Therapeutic effect of BAIC could be enhanced by combining it with CHM.
512,29265672,Patients and partners both cope individually and as a dyad with challenges related to a breast cancer diagnosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a psychological attachment-oriented couple intervention for breast cancer patients and partners in the early treatment phase.,"A randomised controlled trial including 198 recently diagnosed breast cancer patients and their partners. Couples were randomised to the Hand in Hand (HiH) intervention in addition to usual care or to usual care only. Self-report assessments were conducted for both patients and partners at baseline, postintervention (5\u00a0months), and follow-up (10\u00a0months), assessing cancer-related distress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and dyadic adjustment. Patients' cancer-related distress was the primary outcome.","Cancer-related distress decreased over time in both patients and partners, but the intervention did not significantly affect this decrease at postintervention (P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) or follow-up (P\u00a0=\u00a0.71). A significant positive effect was found on dyadic adjustment at follow-up for both patients (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) and partners (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02).","There was no significant effect of the HiH intervention cancer-related distress. The results suggest that most couples can cope with cancer-related distress in the context of usual care. However, the positive effect on dyadic adjustment implies that the HiH intervention benefitted both patients and partners. Future studies should investigate how to integrate a couple focus in usual cancer care to improve dyadic coping in the early treatment phase."
513,17402204,A randomized trial of breast self-examination (BSE) Program was carried out to evaluate whether the intensive BSE could reduce the number of deaths among women from breast cancer.,"This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A total of 266 064 women (age of 30 to 64 years) associated with 519 textile factories in Shanghai had been randomly assigned to a BSE group (132 979 women) or a control group (133 085 women) since 1989. Initial instruction in BSE group would include demonstration of proper palpation techniques and was followed by 2 reinforcement sessions during the subsequent 4 years including video shows, BSE instruction sessions and BSE practice under medical supervision. These activities were continued for 5 years. Attendance at all events was recorded. The cohort was followed through July 2000 for development of breast diseases, and the breast cancer cases were followed through 2001 for vital status. Data analysis methods used would include Kaplan-Meier plots, log-rank test and Cox modeling.","Among women under instruction, 864 breast cancers detected and 133 breast cancer deaths occurred while 896 breast cancers were detected and 130 deaths recorded in the control group. The tumor size (P = 0.07), TNM stage (P = 0.39) and cumulative breast cancer mortality rate (P = 0.72) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, more and smaller fibroadenomas were detected in the instruction group than in the control group (P&lt; 0.01).","Intensive instruction in BSE did not seem to have reduced the mortality rate of breast cancer, but more and smaller benign breast lumps could be detected."
514,30159604,The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to examine the efficacy of Pennebaker's expressive writing intervention (EWI) in improving the perceived quality of life (QoL) and in reducing psychiatric symptoms among patients who received a cancer diagnosis.,"Seventy-one consecutively recruited patients who received a cancer diagnosis for the first time in their life were randomized into two groups: an EWI group (EWG: n\u2009=\u200935) and a control group (CG n\u2009=\u200936). At the baseline, anamnestic information was collected for all patients, and the patients completed a series of self-reported measures assessing psychiatric symptoms, alexithymia, and health-related QoL. A modified Pennebaker's EWI adapted to cancer diagnosis was also administered to the EWG. Six months later, 32 patients (EWG: n\u2009=\u200917, CG: n\u2009=\u200915) participated in the follow-up and filled out the same questionnaires.","The Pennebaker's EWI was effective in decreasing global psychopathology (d\u2009=\u2009\u00a0-.55). Small but significant effects were also observed for alexithymia levels and health-related QoL, with the EWG showing a reduction in alexithymia levels (d\u2009=\u2009\u00a0-.31) and an increase in the mental component of QoL (d\u2009=\u2009.31) compared to the CG.",Our findings indicate that the Pennebaker's EWI is effective in reducing the negative impact of cancer diagnosis on patients' mental health.
515,28408001,To assess the cost-effectiveness of an educational intervention encouraging self-skin examinations for early detection of skin cancers among men older than 50 years.,"A lifetime Markov model was constructed to combine data from the Skin Awareness Trial and other published sources. The model incorporated a health system perspective and the cost and health outcomes for melanoma, squamous and basal cell carcinomas, and benign skin lesions. Key model outcomes included Australian costs (2015), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, and counts of skin cancers. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address parameter uncertainty.","The mean cost of the intervention was A$5,298 compared with A$4,684 for usual care, whereas mean QALYs were 7.58 for the intervention group and 7.77 for the usual care group. The intervention was thus inferior to usual care. When only survival gain is considered, the model predicted the intervention would cost A$1,059 per life-year saved. The likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective up to A$50,000 per QALY gained was 43.9%. The model was stable to most data estimates; nevertheless, it relies on the specificity of clinical diagnosis of skin cancers and is subject to limited health utility data for people with skin lesions.","Although the intervention improved skin checking behaviors and encouraged men to seek medical advice about suspicious lesions, the overall costs and effects from also detecting more squamous and basal cell carcinomas and benign lesions outweighed the positive health gains from detecting more thin melanomas."
516,17079090,"The effect of public service announcements aimed at promoting primary prevention of skin cancer may be limited by superficial cognitive processing. The use of both pictures and textual arguments in sun protection public service announcements were evaluated for their potentially beneficial effects on judgment, cognitive processing and persuasiveness.","In a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design individuals were shown public service announcements that advocated the advantages of sun protection measures in different versions in which a picture was present or not present and a textual argument was present or not present. The 159 participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. In each condition, participants were shown 12 different public service announcements designed according to the condition. Participants judged each public service announcement on attractiveness, credibility, clarity of communication and the required amount of reflection. After the judgment task, they completed a questionnaire to assess knowledge, perceived advantages and disadvantages of sun protection and intended use of sun protection measures.","Pictures enhanced attractiveness, but diminished comprehension. Textual arguments enhanced attractiveness, credibility and comprehension. Pictures as well as textual arguments increased knowledge of sun protection measures.",Pictures and textual arguments in public service announcements positively influence the individual's perception of the advantages of sun protection methods and the advantages of their adoption.
517,28475678,"Multiple pilot studies, including one in colorectal cancer patients, suggest that creatine, an amino acid derivative, augments muscle, improves strength, and thereby could palliate the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome.","In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, incurable patients with this syndrome were assigned creatine (20\u2009g/day load\u00d75 days followed by 2\u2009g/day orally) versus identical placebo.

This study evaluates the effects of a combined physical exercise and psychosocial intervention on health-related quality of life (HrQoL) and psychosocial functioning in childhood cancer patients.","In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, cancer patients (aged 8-18 years) and their parents filled in questionnaires on HrQoL, depressive symptoms, behavioral problems, and self-esteem. Measurements were conducted at baseline, shortly after the 12-week intervention period and 12 months after baseline. Generalized estimating equations analyses were performed to assess short-term and long-term psychosocial effects.","Of the 174 eligible patients, 68 (39.1%) participated.

519,12556062,"This study tested a breast cancer education intervention for African American women with poor screening histories. Disparities in rates of later-stage disease and death may be related to lower screening rates due to behavioral (e.g., knowledge gap) and structural (e.g., access) barriers.","94 African American women (low-income, poor screening histories) were randomly assigned for an educational and on-site screening intervention, or non-intervention status. Primary care sites were used for educational purposes. Three-month post-intervention mammography was assessed.","The intervention group had significantly higher screening rates than the non-intervention group. The latter had a knowledge gap, poor screening history, cancer fears, and insurance differences relative to the screened women. Screening was predicted by behavioral, rather than structural factors.","Since low-income African American women face behavioral and structural barriers to breast cancer screening, an educational program that improves knowledge levels and is offered in primary care sites can effectively impact screening."
520,15958649,"Green tea has been shown to exhibit cancer-preventive activities in preclinical studies. Its consumption has been associated with decreased risk of certain types of cancers in humans. The oral bioavailability of the major green tea constituents, green tea catechins, is low, resulting in systemic catechin levels in humans many fold less than the effective concentrations determined in in vitro systems. We conducted this clinical study to test the hypothesis that the oral bioavailability of green tea catechins can be enhanced when consumed in the absence of food.","Thirty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of the following doses of Polyphenon E (a decaffeinated and defined green tea catechin mixture): 400, 800, or 1,200 mg, based on the epigallocatechin gallate content (10 subjects per dose group). After an overnight fast, study participants took a single dose of Polyphenon E with or without a light breakfast, which consisted of one or two 4-oz muffins and a glass of water. Following a 1-week wash-out period, subjects were crossed over to take the same dose of Polyphenon E under the opposite fasting/fed condition. Tea catechin concentrations in plasma and urine samples collected after dosing were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis.","Consistent with previous reports, epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate were present in plasma mostly as the free form, whereas epicatechin and epigallocatechin were mostly present as the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. There was &gt;3.5-fold increase in the average maximum plasma concentration of free epigallocatechin gallate when Polyphenon E was taken in the fasting condition than when taken with food. The dosing condition led to a similar change in plasma-free epigallocatechin and epicatechin gallate levels. Taking Polyphenon E in the fasting state did not have a significant effect on the plasma levels of total (free and conjugated) epigallocatechin, but resulted in lower plasma levels of total epicatechin. Urinary epigallocatechin gallate and epicatechin gallate levels were very low or undetectable following Polyphenon E administration with either dosing condition. Taking Polyphenon E under the fasting state resulted in a significant decrease in the urinary recovery of total epigallocatechin and epicatechin. Polyphenon E administered as a single dose over the dose range studied was generally well-tolerated by the study participants. Mild and transient nausea was noted in some of the study participants and was seen most often at the highest study agent dose (1,200 mg epigallocatechin gallate) and in the fasting condition.",We conclude that greater oral bioavailability of free catechins can be achieved by taking the Polyphenon E capsules on an empty stomach after an overnight fast. Polyphenon E up to a dose that contains 800 mg epigallocatechin gallate is well-tolerated when taken under the fasting condition. This dosing condition is also expected to optimize the biological effects of tea catechins.
521,10879896,"To promote prevention and early detection of cancer, the authors conducted a three-year intervention targeting Vietnamese physicians in solo practice in California.","Twenty subjects who had received their medical training in Vietnam were recruited into a randomized controlled trial. The intervention included computerized or manual cancer screening reminders, continuing medical education seminars, Vietnamese-language health education materials, newsletters, and oncology data-query programs. Evaluation included chart audits for eight targeted activities pre- and post-intervention.","Before the intervention, annual physician performance rates were low for all eight activities: routine checkups (65.6%), Pap testing (13.8%), pelvic examinations (19.8%), clinical breast examinations (13.3%), mammography (6.4%), hepatitis B serologies (21.9%), hepatitis B immunizations (12.8%), and smoking cessation counseling (1.6%). After the intervention, performance rates increased significantly for smoking cessation counseling (p = 0.02), Pap testing (p = 0.004), and pelvic examinations (p = 0.01).","The results demonstrate the efficacy of an intervention targeting Vietnamese primary care physicians in promoting smoking cessation counseling, Pap testing, and pelvic examinations, but not other cancer prevention activities."
522,27887806,"This study compared the efficacy of two psychological interventions, a coping and communication-enhancing intervention (CCI) and supportive counseling (SC), in reducing depressive symptoms, cancer-specific distress, fear of recurrence, and emotional well-being of women diagnosed with gynecological cancer. Demographic, medical, and psychological moderators of intervention effects were evaluated.","Three hundred fifty-two women with gynecological cancer were randomly assigned to eight sessions of CCI, eight sessions of SC, or usual care (UC). Participants completed measures of distress and wellbeing at six time points over an 18month period of time.",CCI had a beneficial impact on depressive symptoms and cancer specific distress over the first six months as compared with UC and SC and had a beneficial impact on emotional well-being. The greater coping skill development in CCI has made it a more effective intervention than traditional SC across a broader range of key psychological outcomes. Declines among women in the SC condition were not significantly different from UC.,"The CCI intervention had significant effect on patients' depression, cancer-specific distress, and emotional well-being during a time when the majority of newly diagnosed patients experience elevated levels of distress. Ameliorating such distress post-diagnosis merits its incorporation into clinical care. A brief 8-session structured intervention can be readily applied to this distressed population in need. Brief supportive counseling did not evidence treatment effects, suggesting that more structured approaches are crucial to truly deliver benefits."
523,19204604,"Participating in regular physical activity is encouraged after treatment for breast cancer, with exception of those who have subsequently developed lymphedema. The purpose of this project was to investigate, in a randomized controlled trial, the effect of participating in a supervised, mixed-type exercise program on lymphedema status among women with lymphedema after breast cancer.","Women younger than 76 yr, who completed breast cancer treatment at least 6 months prior and had subsequently developed unilateral, upper-limb lymphedema, were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 16) or control (n = 16) group. The intervention group (IG) participated in 20 supervised, group, aerobic and resistance exercise sessions over 12 wk, whereas the control group (CG) was instructed to continue habitual activities. Lymphedema status was assessed by bioimpedance spectroscopy (impedance ratio between limbs) and perometry (volume difference between limbs), and independent t-tests (two-tailed P &lt; 0.05) were used to determine statistical significance of observed changes.","Mean ratio and volume measures at baseline were similar for the IG (1.13 +/- 0.15 and 337 +/- 307 mL, respectively) and the CG (1.13 +/- 0.19 and 377 +/- 416 mL, respectively), and no changes were observed over time for either group. Although no group change was observed between preintervention and 3-month follow-up for the IG (ratio and volume change = 0.02 +/- 0.07 and 2 +/- 71 mL, respectively), two women in this group no longer had evidence of lymphedema by study end. Average attendance was more than 70% of supervised sessions, there were no withdrawals, and several qualitative comments from participants support the program acceptability.","The results from this pilot study indicate that, at minimum, exercise does not exacerbate secondary lymphedema. Women with secondary lymphedema should be encouraged to be physically active, optimizing their physical and psychosocial recovery."
524,17168431,Sixty patients with breast cancer were randomly assigned to oral glutamine or placebo pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CEF regimen).,"Oral glutamine supplementation was continued for at least 12 days. Patients kept a daily record of diarrhea and stomatitis. The plasma glutamine level, intestinal permeability (lactulose-mannitol test), and tumor size were analyzed. The expression of Ki-67 and PCNA antigens in breast carcinoma was assessed.","The plasma glutamine level was significantly higher in the glutamine group than in the placebo group (420.39 +/- 52.39 mmol/L vs 309.76 +/- 42.34 mmol/L, P &lt; 0.05). After one cycle of chemotherapy, the lactulose-mannitol ratio was higher in the placebo group than in the glutamine group (0.0630 +/- 0.0091 vs 0.0471 +/- 0.0094, P &lt; 0.05). No differences were observed in the grades of stomatitis and diarrhea, in the changes in tumor size, and in the expression of Ki-67 and PCNA antigens between the two groups.","Prophylactic oral glutamine could ameliorate the neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced increase in intestinal permeability, but had no significant positive clinical effect on stomatitis and diarrhea and did not interfere with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy."
525,17266520,"Induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activities, enzymes that activate or detoxify xenobiotics, is one mechanism by which vegetables may alter cancer risk. As the effect of food on CYP enzyme activities have not been studied in the Jordanian population, we examined the effect of supplementing the diet with broccoli on CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 activities.","Five men and five women, non-smokers, consumed a standard diet of broccoli (500 g) for 6 days. Enzyme activities were determined by measuring urinary metabolite ratios after a 100 mg caffeine tablet on the seventh day.","The mean CYP1A2 activity for men (21.1+/-3.2) was significantly lower than that for women (27.6+/-1.6) before the consumption of broccoli (P&lt;0.05). These activities were significantly induced in both men (52.5+/-6.6) and women (36.6+/-8.4) after a standard diet of broccoli (P&lt;0.005). Similarly, the mean value of CYP2A6 activity for men was 0.061+/-0.040 and for women, 0.144+/-0.039 before consumption of broccoli, which were significantly different (P&lt;0.05). The activity of CYP2A6 was induced in both groups significantly after broccoli consumption (P&lt;0.05). The mean value for men was 0.193+/-0.02 and for women, 0.214+/-0.064.",Our study on a group of Jordanians confirmed the well-established observation that broccoli induces CYP1A2 activity. This study also demonstrates the effect of gender and broccoli consumption on CYP2A6 activity in Jordanians.
526,16076712,"With the use of a new automatic stoma valve (ASV) it appears possible to rehabilitate patients who have previously been unsuccessful in acquiring hands-free speech. As well as making daily ASV use possible for an additional group of patients, this new device was also appreciated by many patients as an additional rehabilitation tool for specific occasions. Despite statistically significant improvements in aspects of voice and breathing using this novel ASV, improvement of peristomal adhesion is probably the main factor needed to further increase success rates. Nevertheless, our results show that it makes sense to keep trying to achieve hands-free speech, even if previous attempts have failed.","To make a long-term (6 months) assessment of compliance and aspects of voice, breathing and quality of life using a new ASV: the Provox FreeHands heat and moisture exchanger (HME).","This was a prospective clinical multicentre trial in 79 laryngectomized patients (8 regular ASV users, 58 previously unsuccessful users and 13 new users). Data were collected at baseline and after 1 and 6 months by means of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaires and specific structured questionnaires concerning compliance, skin adhesion, voicing and pulmonary aspects. An objective assessment of voice parameters (maximum phonation time, maximum phonation time while counting, dynamic loudness range and number of pauses in a standard read-aloud text) was made for comparison of different stoma occlusion methods (digital occlusion via an HME and two different ASVs). A subjective assessment of overall voice quality was made.","After 6 months, 19% of patients used the new ASV on a daily basis (mean 5 h/day), while 57% used it on an irregular basis as an additional rehabilitation tool for special occasions. Two-thirds of the study group indicated that they would continue to use the new ASV after the study period. With respect to the objective parameters, statistically significantly better maximum phonation times and dynamic loudness ranges were observed with the new ASV compared to the Blom-Singer ASV. However, the best results for all the objective parameters were obtained with digital occlusion via the Provox HME."
527,17645262,To probe the effect of previous analgesia of scalp acupuncture.,"Sixty cases of radical operation of intestinal cancer were randomly divided into 2 groups: a scalp acupuncture plus epidural analgesia (scalp acupuncture group) and an epidural analgesia group, 30 cases in each group. The scalp acupuncture group received scalp acupuncture from 20 min before operation to the end of the operation, and epidural analgesia at the end of the operation. The epidural analgesia group only received epidural analgesia at the end of the operation. Recovery of VAS scores, BCS scores and gastrointestinal function after operation were investigated to probe into effects of scalp acupuncture on epidural morphine analgesia after operation in the patient of intestinal cancer.","The VAS scores at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h in the scalp acupuncture group were lower than the epidural analgesia group, with significant differences at 6 h and 12 h between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). BCS scores at the 4 time points in the scalp acupuncture group were lower than the epidural analgesia group with significant differences between the two groups (all P &lt; 0.05). The scalp acupuncture group in recovery of bowel sound, exsufflation from the anus in the scalp acupuncture group was faster than the epidural analgesia group (P &lt; 0.01).","Scalp acupuncture has a certain previous analgesic effect, reducing discomfort of the patient after operation and promoting the recovery of gastrointestinal functions."
528,18067438,Teaching cancer prevention and detection is important in health professional education. It is desirable to select a comprehensive framework for teaching oral cancer (OC) prevention and detection skills.,"The PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used to design a randomized pretest and posttest study of the OC prevention and detection skills of dental students (n = 104). OC knowledge, opinions, and competencies were evaluated.",Second year students in the intervention group were more competent than those in the control group.,The novel use of PRECEDE-PROCEED sets a precedent for designing a standardized OC curriculum for a wide range of health professional disciplines.
529,20605360,Hot flashes are common side effect due to androgen ablation therapy (AAT). The utility of acupuncture for hot flashes in men has not been thoroughly studied. We prospectively studied the effect of acupuncture in men with hot flashes.,The study was approved by internal review board. Seventeen men with hot flashes and history of AAT for prostate cancer were enrolled. Three men declined participation before receiving any treatment. A hot flash score (HFS) was used to measure daily hot flashes. The composite daily score was calculated as the product of frequency \u00d7 severity. The baseline daily scores were compared with scores taken at 2 and 6 weeks and at 8-month average follow-up.,"No side effects were encountered during, immediately after treatment, or at 8 months. The mean initial HFS was 28.3; it dropped to 10.3 (p = 0.0001) at 2 weeks posttreatment, 7.5 (p = 0.0001) at 6 weeks, and 7.0 (p = 0.001) at 8 months. Clinical improvement for each patient is defined as the percent decrease in the mean HFS at each time point. The mean improvement at Weeks 2 and 6 was 68.4% (mean HFS decreased from 37.409 to 11.836, p = 0.001) and 89.2% (mean HFS decreased from 37.409 to 4.05, p = 0.0078) respectively. The improvement at 8 months was 80.3% (mean HFS decreased from 37.409 to 7.385, p = 0.002).",Acupuncture provides excellent control of hot flashes in men with a history of AAT. The absence of side effects and the durable response at 8 months are likely to be appealing to patients. Prospective randomized study is warranted to further evaluate this modality against medical therapy.
530,30075329,"Short telomeres may indicate a higher risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. Some observational studies show positive associations between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and physical activity levels. We hypothesized, therefore, that exercise may be one strategy for slowing telomere attrition.","We conducted an ancillary analysis of blood from a year-long, two-centred, two-armed (1:1) randomized controlled trial of aerobic exercise versus usual inactivity. The analysis included 212 physically inactive, disease-free, non-smoking, postmenopausal women (n\u202f=\u202f99 exercisers, n\u202f=\u202f113 controls) in Alberta, Canada (2003-2006). The exercise prescription was aerobic exercise five days/week (supervised three days/week), 45\u202fmin/session, achieving 70-80% heart rate reserve. Baseline and 12-month LTL were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). The primary statistical analysis was intention-to-treat, comparing the ratio of mean LTLs (12-months:baseline) for exercisers versus controls from a general linear model. Secondary analyses included a per-protocol analysis (\u226590% adherence) and analyses stratified by baseline LTL, age, body mass index, and fitness level, respectively.","Participants were overweight at baseline (mean BMI\u202f=\u202f29\u202fkg/m). The primary analysis showed no evidence that LTL change differed between groups (12-month mean LTL change for the exercise group: -13% (95% CI: -32%, 11%) versus controls: -8% (95%CI: -27%, 15%); treatment effect ratio (TER, Exercise/Control)\u202f=\u202f0.95 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.32). Per-protocol results were similar (TER\u202f=\u202f0.87, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.30). In stratified models, TERs ranged from 0.68 to 1.35 across strata and P-interaction\u202f&gt;\u202f0.05).",We found no evidence to suggest that one year of aerobic exercise alters telomere attrition significantly in healthy postmenopausal women.
531,28478854,"Radical Cystectomy with a creation of an uro-stoma is first line treatment in advanced bladder-cancer. Enhancing or maintaining an individual's condition, skills and physical wellbeing before surgery has been defined as prehabilitation. Whether preoperative stoma-education is an effective element in prehabilitation is yet to be documented. In a prospective randomized controlled design (RCT) the aim was to investigate the efficacy of a standardised preoperative stoma-education program on an individual's ability to independently change a stoma-appliance.","A parent RCT-study investigated the efficacy of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program on length of stay following cystectomy. A total of 107 patients were included in the intension-to-treat-population. Preoperatively, the intervention-group was instructed to a standardized stoma-education program consisting of areas recognized necessary to change a stoma appliance. The Urostomy Education Scale was used to measure stoma self-care at day 35, 120 and 365 postoperatively. Efficacy was expressed as a positive difference in UES-score between treatment-groups.","A significant difference in mean score was found in the intervention group compared to standard of 2.7 (95% CI: 0.9; 4.5), 4.3 (95% CI: 2.1; 6.5) and 5.1 (95% CI: 2.3; 7.8) at day 35, 120 and 365 postoperatively.",For the first time a study in a RCT-design have reported a positive efficacy of a short-term preoperative stoma intervention. Preoperative stoma-education is an effective intervention and adds to the evidence base of prehabilitation. Further RCT-studies powered with self-efficacy as the primer outcome are requested.
532,12471288,The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effect of aerobic exercise on physiological and psychological function in patients rehabilitating from cancer treatment. A second purpose was to evaluate the differential effects of low- and moderate-intensity exercise on these variables.,"Eighteen survivors of breast or colon cancer (15 female and 3 male, 40-65 yr of age) served as subjects. The subjects were matched by aerobic capacity and scores on a Quality of Life questionnaire, and then randomly assigned to a control, low- (25-35% heart rate reserve (HRR)), or a moderate- (40-50% HRR) intensity exercise group. The exercise groups performed lower-body aerobic exercise three times a week for 10 wk. After the exercise training, there were no statistically significant differences between the two exercise groups on any of the physiological variables. Therefore, the exercise groups were combined into one group for the final analysis.","The results revealed statistically significant increases in aerobic capacity (P &lt; 0.001) and lower-body flexibility (P = 0.027), a significant decrease in body fat (P &lt; 0.001), and a significant increase in quality of life (P &lt; 0.001) and a measure of energy (P = 0.038) in the exercise group when compared with the control group.",Low- and moderate-intensity aerobic-exercise programs were equally effective in improving physiological and psychological function in this population of cancer survivors. Aerobic exercise appears to be a valuable and well-tolerated component of the cancer-rehabilitation process.

534,23318529,Previous research has shown exercise to be an effective method to mitigate many adverse treatment-related effects of androgen suppression therapy (AST) but the potential impact of exercise on sexual activity remains unknown. The purpose of this investigation was to report the effect of a 12-week exercise program on sexual activity in prostate cancer patients undergoing AST.,Fifty-seven prostate cancer patients undergoing AST were randomly assigned to an exercise program (resistance and aerobic modes; n=29) or usual care control (n=28). Sexual activity was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer prostate cancer-specific quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-PR25).,"QLQ-PR25 data were log transformed and analysis of covariance was used to compare sexual activity between groups following the intervention adjusted for baseline activity. No differences in sexual activity were observed between the exercise and control groups before the intervention. There was a significant (P=0.045) adjusted group difference in sexual activity following the 12-week intervention. Patients undergoing usual care decreased sexual activity while patients in the exercise program maintained their level of sexual activity. At baseline, 20.6 and 22.2% of participants in the exercise and control groups reported a major interest in sex (that is, high libido). Following the intervention, the exercise group had a significantly higher percentage of participants reporting a major interest in sex (exercise=17.2% vs control=0%; P=0.024).",Participation in a short-term exercise program resulted in the maintenance of sexual activity in prostate cancer patients undergoing AST.
535,12560436,To examine the effect of a progressive upper-body exercise program on lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment.,"Fourteen breast cancer survivors with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema were randomly assigned to an exercise (n = 7) or control group (n = 7). The exercise group followed a progressive, 8-week upper-body exercise program consisting of resistance training plus aerobic exercise using a Monark Rehab Trainer arm ergometer. Lymphedema was assessed by arm circumference and measurement of arm volume by water displacement. Patients were evaluated on five occasions over the experimental period. The Medical Outcomes Trust Short-Form 36 Survey was used to measure quality of life before and after the intervention. Significance was set at alpha &lt; or = 0.01.","No changes were found in arm circumference or arm volume as a result of the exercise program. Three of the quality-of-life domains showed trends toward increases in the exercise group: physical functioning (P =.050), general health (P =.048), and vitality (P =.023). Mental health increased, although not significantly, for all subjects (P =.019). Arm volume measured by water displacement was correlated with calculated arm volume (r =.973, P &lt;.001), although the exercise and control group means were significantly different (P &lt;.001).","Participation in an upper-body exercise program caused no changes in arm circumference or arm volume in women with lymphedema after breast cancer, and they may have experienced an increase in quality of life. Additional studies should be done in this area to determine the optimum training program."
536,16608025,"During the perioperative period after open colorectal surgery, surgical stress affects changes in the autonomic nervous system of patients. The decreased intestinal motility results in many complaints for patients. To resolve this problem, the usefulness of gum-chewing for improving the motility was examined.","Twenty-two patients with colorectal cancer were divided into two groups; gum-chewing and control groups. From after their operation, chewing gum was given to the former group three times a day.","The first passage of flatus and stool in the chewing-gum group after operation were 35 and 50 hours, respectively, sooner for the controls.",It was concluded that gum-chewing provides a simple and effective method to improve the postoperative state of patients.
537,15064218,Failure to obtain cervical cancer screening can be precipitated by limited knowledge. This study describes understanding of Papanicolaou (Pap) smear testing among women undergoing emergency department (ED) pelvic examination and tests the feasibility of educating patients in the ED.,"Patients undergoing pelvic examination in an urban, tertiary care ED were surveyed about Pap smear screening. Among the initial cohort, no education was provided prior to survey administration. Subsequently, a pilot study of scripted information provided by physicians alone or both physicians and counselors was conducted.","There were 81 patients in the non-intervention cohort and 32 patients in the intervention cohort. Of the 32 intervention patients, 16 received physician-administered intervention, and 16 received reinforced counseling (physician + counselor). Of 113 total patients, 90 (82%) were African American; mean age was 26 years (SD +/- 7.7 years). Of the 81 non-intervention patients, six (7%; 95% CI = 3% to 15%) said they were told that a Pap test was not done, and 60 (74%; 95% CI = 64% to 82%) mistakenly believed they had a Pap test. Sixty-six (81.5%; 95% CI = 72% to 88%) patients stated they knew the purpose of a Pap test; only 17 (26%; 95% CI = 17% to 37%) of these correctly identified the Pap test as a test for cervical cancer. All 32 intervention patients were surveyed after physician counseling. Compared with the non-intervention group, fewer (56%; 95% CI = 39% to 72%) thought they had a Pap test, and more (31%; 95% CI = 18% to 49%) said they were told they did not receive a Pap test. All 16 reinforced intervention patients correctly denied receiving a Pap test after counselor education.",Knowledge of Pap testing among women undergoing ED pelvic examination is poor; most mistakenly believe they receive a Pap test during ED evaluation. Educating patients may be feasible and effective in the ED setting.
538,15611506,Previous studies found that African American and Hispanic cancer patients are at risk for undertreatment of pain. We evaluated the efficacy of a pain education intervention for underserved minority patients.,"Ninety-seven underserved African American and Hispanic outpatients with cancer-related pain were enrolled onto a randomized clinical trial of pain management education. The patients in the education group received a culture-specific video and booklet on pain management. The control group received a video and booklet on nutrition. A research nurse met with each patient to review the materials. We measured changes in pain intensity and pain-related interference 2 to 10 weeks after the intervention, as well as changes in quality of life, perceived pain control, functional status, analgesics, and physician pain assessments.","Physicians underestimated baseline pain intensity and provided inadequate analgesics for more than 50% of the sample. Although the ratings for pain intensity and pain interference decreased over time for both groups, there was no statistically significant difference between groups. Pain education did not affect quality of life, perceived pain control, or functional status. African American patients in the education but not the control group reported a significant decrease in pain worst ratings from baseline to first follow-up (P &lt; .01), although this decrease was not maintained at subsequent assessments.","Brief education had limited impact on pain outcomes for underserved minority patients, suggesting that more intensive education for patients and interventions for physicians are needed."
539,22946083,To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an interdisciplinary intervention for mothers of children newly diagnosed with cancer and to estimate effect sizes for the intervention in reducing distress. Management of illness uncertainty was a key framework for the intervention.,"Mothers (N = 52) were randomly assigned to the intervention or a treatment as usual group, completing measures at baseline and follow-up time points.","Mothers' satisfaction ratings were consistently high, and intervention implementation appeared feasible. Significant mean effects or trends in favor of the intervention group were found for pre-to-post change on measures of distress. Evidence of a preventative effect was also observed; mothers in the intervention group tended to improve or remain stable in their adjustment, whereas many parents in the treatment as usual group showed worsening outcomes.",An interdisciplinary intervention targeting maternal illness uncertainty has clinical value within this sample.
540,20167900,"We evaluated the impact of a mailed, tailored intervention on skin cancer prevention and skin self-examination behaviors of adults at moderate and high risk for skin cancer.","Adults at moderate and high risk for skin cancer were recruited in primary health care settings in Honolulu, HI, and Long Island, NY. After completing a baseline survey, participants were randomized to 2 groups. The treatment group received tailored materials, including personalized risk feedback, and the control group received general educational materials. Multivariate analyses compared sun protection and skin self-examination between groups, controlling for location, risk level, gender, and age.","A total of 596 adults completed the trial. The tailored materials had a significant effect on overall sun-protection habits, the use of hats, the use of sunglasses, and the recency of skin self-examination. Some effects were moderated by location and risk level.","Tailored communications including personalized risk feedback can improve sun-protection behaviors and skin self-examination among adults at increased risk for skin cancer. These convenient, low-cost interventions can be implemented in a variety of settings and should be tested further to assess their long-term effectiveness."
541,24395288,We sought to improve lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS-BMD) in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using calcium and cholecalciferol supplementation.,"This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 275 participants (median age, 17 [9-36.1] years) with age- and gender-specific LS-BMD Z-scores &lt;0 to receive nutritional counseling with supplementation of 1,000 mg/day calcium and 800 International Unit cholecalciferol or placebo for 2 years. The primary outcome was change in LS-BMD assessed by quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) at 24 months. Linear regression models were employed to identify the baseline risk factors for low LS-BMD and to compare LS-BMD outcomes.","Pre-randomization LS-BMD below the mean was associated with male gender (P = 0.0024), White race (P = 0.0003), lower body mass index (P &lt; 0.0001), and cumulative glucocorticoid doses of \u2265 5,000 mg (P = 0.0012). One hundred eighty-eight (68%) participants completed the study; 77% adhered to the intervention. Mean LS-BMD change did not differ between survivors randomized to supplements (0.33 \u00b1 0.57) or placebo (0.28 \u00b1 0.56). Participants aged 9-13 years and those 22-35 years had the greatest mean increases in LS-BMD (0.50 \u00b1 0.66 and 0.37 \u00b1 0.23, respectively). Vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25[OH]D &lt;30 ng/ml) found in 296 (75%), was not associated with LS-BMD outcomes (P = 0.78).",Cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation provides no added benefit to nutritional counseling for improving LS-BMD among adolescent and young adult survivors of ALL (93% of whom had LS-BMD Z-scores above the mean at study entry).
542,20716619,To evaluate a decision aid (DA) designed to promote informed decision making for prostate cancer screening.,"Twelve work sites were randomly assigned to an intervention or nonintervention comparison condition. Intervention sites received access to a computer-tailored DA at the workplace. Male employees age 45 years and above (n = 625) completed surveys at baseline and at 3-month follow-up, documenting aspects of informed decision making.","Using an intention-to-treat analysis, men in the intervention group were significantly more likely to have made a screening decision and to have improved knowledge without increased decisional conflict, relative to men in the comparison group. These changes were observed despite the fact that only 30% of men in intervention sites used the DA. Among DA users, similar improvements were observed, although the magnitudes of changes were substantially greater, and significant improvements in decision self-efficacy were observed.","A DA offered in the workplace promoted decision making, improved knowledge, and increased decision self-efficacy among users, without increasing decisional conflict. However, participation was suboptimal, suggesting that better methods for engaging men in workplace interventions are needed. IMPACT STATEMENT: This trial shows the efficacy of a computer-tailored DA in promoting informed decisions about prostate cancer screening. The DA was delivered through work sites, thereby providing access to resources required to participate in informed decision making without requiring a medical appointment. However, participation rates were suboptimal, and additional strategies for engaging men are needed."
543,10022700,"Most men who undergo castration therapy for prostatic carcinoma will have vasomotor symptoms that usually persist for years. Vasomotor symptoms are elicited from the thermoregulatory center, possibly due to a decrease in hypothalamic opioid activity induced by low sex steroid concentrations. Acupuncture treatment in women, which stimulates hypothalamic opioid activity, alleviates vasomotor symptoms. We report on men treated with acupuncture for relief of vasomotor symptoms after castration therapy.",We asked 7 men with vasomotor symptoms due to castration therapy to receive acupuncture treatment 30 minutes twice weekly for 2 weeks and once a week for 10 weeks. Effects on flushes were recorded in logbooks.,Of the 7 men 6 completed at least 10 weeks of acupuncture therapy and all had a substantial decrease in the number of hot flushes (average 70% after 10 weeks). At 3 months after the last treatment the number of flushes was 50% lower than before therapy. Therapy was discontinued after 10 weeks because of a femoral neck fracture in 1 man and after 3 weeks due to severe back pain in 1.,Acupuncture may be a therapeutic alternative in men with hot flushes after castration therapy and merits further evaluation.
544,11477817,To probe the relationship between survival period and immune function of hepatic carcinoma patients after embolism chemotherapy.,"One hundred and eight patients of hepatocarcinoma were randomly divided into three groups. Group A was given simple embolism chemotherapy (ECT), immunotherapy and Chinese herbal medicine were given to Group B and C respectively after ECT.","The short-term effective rate of Group A, B and C was 61.1%, 83.3% and 80.6% respectively, three-year survival rate 28.6%, 39.1% and 47.3%, median length of survival 11, 17 and 15 months respectively. The difference in terms of these indices were significant. Observation on immune function after treatment showed that patients received ECT alone had a lower immunity than those supplemented with immunotherapy or Chinese herbal medicine.",Period of survival of hepatocarcinoma patients is related with their immune function. Patients with better immunity could enjoy a relatively extended period of survival.
545,12689798,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the most common cause of cancer mortality among Latino women. Several behavioral factors such as early detection and dietary practices could help decrease morbidity and mortality associated with breast cancer in this population. Unfortunately, there are few data regarding the efficacy of health-related interventions for young Latino women.","Mujeres Felices por ser Saludables is a randomized intervention project designed to assess breast cancer risk reduction behavior among Latino women ages 20-40 years. The primary objectives of the project were to determine whether an 8-month integrated dietary/breast health intervention could lead to a greater reduction in dietary fat, increase in dietary fiber, increase in the frequency and proficiency of breast self examination (BSE), and reduction in anxiety related to BSE compared to controls. Herein we describe the overall design of the project and present baseline characteristics of the 256 randomized women.","Our results suggest that the average daily intake of dietary fat (percentage of total energy) was slightly below 30% (percentage of total energy) among the women randomized. While over half of these women reported that they practice BSE, and few reported anxiety related to BSE, less than 27% of women were proficient in the recommended BSE technique.","There are few data on the dietary and breast health behaviors of young low-acculturated Latino women. This study documents the feasibility of recruiting, randomizing, and obtaining both baseline dietary and breast health data on this unique and underserved population."
546,29172605,"This randomized controlled trial (RCT), conducted in patients with breast cancer, aimed to compare the effects of cognitive therapy (CT), bright light therapy (BLT), and a waiting-list control condition (WLC) on depressive symptoms.","Sixty-two women were randomly assigned to an 8-week CT (n = 25), BLT (n = 26), or WLC (n = 11). Participants completed the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at pre- and posttreatment (and postwaiting for WLC), as well as 3 and 6 months later.","At posttreatment, CT patients had a significantly greater reduction of depressive symptoms than WLC on the HADS-D and the BDI-II. BLT patients had a greater reduction of depressive symptoms than WLC on the HADS-D only. After WLC participants were reassigned to CT or BLT, a superiority of CT over BLT was found on the BDI-II at posttreatment. Patients of both active conditions showed a good sustainment of treatment gains at follow-ups.","Although replication with larger samples is needed, these results confirm the efficacy of CT for depression in the context of breast cancer and suggest that BLT could be of some utility when CT is not available or desired.

547,12406050,"The aims of this pilot study were the following: 1) to examine patterns of adherence to a brisk walking program in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer using a prospective, randomized, controlled experimental design; 2) to examine the influence of disease symptoms and treatment side effects on exercise levels; and 3) to suggest methods that may improve future clinical trials of moderate-intensity exercise in similar populations.","Fifty-two patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: usual care or usual care plus exercise. Those assigned to the exercise group received a standardized, self-administered, home-based brisk walking intervention in addition to usual care. Each day subjects completed self-report diary forms that elicited information about activity levels, and the occurrence of symptoms and side effects during cancer treatment.","Analyses of self-reported daily activity levels revealed a diffusion of treatment effect. Fifty percent of the usual-care group reported maintaining or increasing their physical activity to a moderate-intensity level, while 33% of the exercise group did not exercise at the prescribed levels. Analyses of self-reported disease symptoms and treatment side effects did not reveal clinically meaningful differences between the two groups.",The results of this study suggest that women who exercised regularly before receiving a breast cancer diagnosis attempted to maintain their exercise programs. Women who lead sedentary lifestyles may benefit from a structured exercise program that includes information and support related to exercise adherence strategies.
548,21709199,"In light of inverse relationships reported in observational studies of vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and melanoma, we evaluated the effects of vitamin D combined with calcium supplementation on skin cancer in a randomized placebo-controlled trial.","Postmenopausal women age 50 to 79 years (N = 36,282) enrolled onto the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) calcium/vitamin D clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive 1,000 mg of elemental calcium plus 400 IU of vitamin D3 (CaD) daily or placebo for a mean follow-up period of 7.0 years. NMSC and melanoma skin cancers were ascertained by annual self-report; melanoma skin cancers underwent physician adjudication.","Neither incident NMSC nor melanoma rates differed between treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.07) and placebo groups (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.16). In subgroup analyses, women with history of NMSC assigned to CaD had a reduced risk of melanoma versus those receiving placebo (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.90; P(interaction) = .038), which was not observed in women without history of NMSC.","Vitamin D supplementation at a relatively low dose plus calcium did not reduce the overall incidence of NMSC or melanoma. However, in women with history of NMSC, CaD supplementation reduced melanoma risk, suggesting a potential role for calcium and vitamin D supplements in this high-risk group. Results from this post hoc subgroup analysis should be interpreted with caution but warrant additional investigation."
549,11445478,"Dietary fat and fiber affect hormonal levels and may influence cancer progression. Flaxseed is a rich source of lignan and omega-3 fatty acids and may thwart prostate cancer. The potential effects of flaxseed may be enhanced with concomitant fat restriction. We undertook a pilot study to explore whether a flaxseed-supplemented, fat-restricted diet could affect the biomarkers of prostatic neoplasia.","Twenty-five patients with prostate cancer who were awaiting prostatectomy were instructed on a low-fat (20% of kilocalories or less), flaxseed-supplemented (30 g/day) diet. The baseline and follow-up levels of prostate-specific antigen, testosterone, free androgen index, and total serum cholesterol were determined. The tumors of diet-treated patients were compared with those of historic cases (matched by age, race, prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis, and biopsy Gleason sum) with respect to apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT]-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling [TUNEL]) and proliferation (MIB-1).","The average duration on the diet was 34 days (range 21 to 77), during which time significant decreases were observed in total serum cholesterol (201 +/- 39 mg/dL to 174 +/- 42 mg/dL), total testosterone (422 +/- 122 ng/dL to 360 +/- 128 ng/dL), and free androgen index (36.3% +/- 18.9% to 29.3% +/- 16.8%) (all P &lt;0.05). The baseline and follow-up levels of prostate-specific antigen were 8.1 +/- 5.2 ng/mL and 8.5 +/- 7.7 ng/mL, respectively, for the entire sample (P = 0.58); however, among men with Gleason sums of 6 or less (n = 19), the PSA values were 7.1 +/- 3.9 ng/mL and 6.4 +/- 4.1 ng/mL (P = 0.10). The mean proliferation index was 7.4 +/- 7.8 for the historic controls versus 5.0 +/- 4.9 for the diet-treated patients (P = 0.05). The distribution of the apoptotic indexes differed significantly (P = 0.01) between groups, with most historic controls exhibiting TUNEL categorical scores of 0; diet-treated patients largely exhibited scores of 1. Both the proliferation rate and apoptosis were significantly associated with the number of days on the diet (P = 0.049 and P = 0.017, respectively).","These pilot data suggest that a flaxseed-supplemented, fat-restricted diet may affect prostate cancer biology and associated biomarkers. Further study is needed to determine the benefit of this dietary regimen as either a complementary or preventive therapy."
550,20406930,To determine whether acupuncture reduces pain and dysfunction in patients with cancer with a history of neck dissection. The secondary objective is to determine whether acupuncture relieves dry mouth in this population.,"Patients at a tertiary cancer center with chronic pain or dysfunction attributed to neck dissection were randomly assigned to weekly acupuncture versus usual care (eg, physical therapy, analgesia, and/or anti-inflammatory drugs, per patient preference or physician recommendation) for 4 weeks. The Constant-Murley score, a composite measure of pain, function, and activities of daily living, was the primary outcome measure. Xerostomia, a secondary end point, was assessed using the Xerostomia Inventory.","Fifty-eight evaluable patients were accrued and randomly assigned from 2004 to 2007 (28 and 30 patients on acupuncture and control arms, respectively). Constant-Murley scores improved more in the acupuncture group (adjusted difference between groups = 11.2; 95% CI, 3.0 to 19.3; P = .008). Acupuncture produced greater improvement in reported xerostomia (adjusted difference in Xerostomia Inventory = -5.8; 95% CI, -0.9 to -10.7; P = .02).","Significant reductions in pain, dysfunction, and xerostomia were observed in patients receiving acupuncture versus usual care. Although further study is needed, these data support the potential role of acupuncture in addressing post-neck dissection pain and dysfunction, as well as xerostomia."
551,19941285,To determine whether a telephone counseling program can improve psychosocial outcomes among breast cancer patients post-treatment.,"A randomized trial was conducted involving 21 hospitals and medical centers, with assessments (self-administered questionnaires) at baseline, 12 and 18 months post-enrollment. Eligibility criteria included early stage diagnosis, enrollment during last treatment visit, and the ability to receive the intervention in English. Endpoints included distress (Impact of Event Scale), depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), and two study-specific measures: sexual dysfunction and personal growth. The control group (n=152) received a resource directory for breast cancer; the intervention group (n=152) also received a one-year, 16 session telephone counseling program augmented with additional print materials.","Significant intervention effects were found for sexual dysfunction at 12 (p=0.03) and 18 months (p=0.04) and personal growth (12 months: p=0.005; 18 months: p=0.03). No differences by group were found in mean scores for distress and depression, with both groups showing significant improvement at 12 and 18 months (all p values for within-group change from baseline were &lt;or=0.003). However, when dichotomized at cutpoints suggestive of the need for a clinical referral, the control group showed virtually no change at 18 months, whereas the intervention group showed about a 50% reduction in both distress (p=0.07) and depression (p=0.06).",Telephone counseling may provide a viable method for extending psychosocial services to cancer survivors nationwide.
552,29880408,"Various clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of physical training offered during and/or after breast cancer treatments. However, given the variety of adverse events that may be encountered, physical training could be combined with psychologic, relational, and social guidance. This kind of multidisciplinary program, as well as its long-term effects, have been little studied so far. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine the benefits at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of a 3-month exercise and education program among women after breast cancer treatment.","Two hundred nine outpatients treated for primary breast carcinoma were divided into a control group (n\u00a0= 106) and an experimental group (n\u00a0= 103) which underwent a 3-month rehabilitation program\u00a0including physical training and psychoeducational sessions. The assessments, performed before the program and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after inclusion, included validated questionnaires on quality of life and symptoms.","The analyses revealed an improvement in quality of life and symptoms after the exercise and education program within the experimental group and a maintenance of these improvements during the 2 years of follow-up. These improvements were significantly better than those in the control group, clearly demonstrating that the program has benefits.",This trial identified the benefits of a well-detailed 3-month exercise and education program over 24 months' follow-up among women after breast cancer treatment.
553,19075284,"To determine whether a low-fat diet high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber differentially affects prognosis in breast cancer survivors with hot flashes (HF) or without HF after treatment.","A secondary analysis was conducted on 2,967 breast cancer survivors, age 18 to 70 years, who were randomly assigned between 1995 and 2000 in a multicenter, controlled trial of a dietary intervention to prevent additional breast cancer events and observed through June 1, 2006. We compared the dietary intervention group with a group who received five-a-day dietary guidelines.","Independent of HF status, a substantial between-group difference among those who did and did not receive dietary guidelines was achieved and maintained at 4 years in intake of vegetable/fruit servings per day (54% higher; 10 v 6.5 servings/d, respectively), fiber (31% higher; 25.5 v 19.4 g/d, respectively), and percent energy from fat (14% lower; 26.9% v 31.3%, respectively). Adjusting for tumor characteristics and antiestrogen treatment, HF-negative women assigned to the intervention had 31% fewer events than HF-negative women assigned to the comparison group (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.93; P = .02). The intervention did not affect prognosis in the women with baseline HFs. Furthermore, compared with HF-negative women assigned to the comparison group, HF-positive women had significantly fewer events in both the intervention (HR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.00; P = .05) and comparison groups (HR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P = .002).","A diet with higher vegetable, fruit, and fiber and lower fat intakes than the five-a-day diet may reduce risk of additional events in HF-negative breast cancer survivors. This suggestive finding needs confirmation in a trial in which it is the primary hypothesis."
554,22498022,"Faith Moves Mountains assessed the effectiveness of a faith-placed lay health advisor (LHA) intervention to increase Papanicolaou (Pap) test use among middle-aged and older women in a region disproportionately affected by cervical cancer and low screening rates (regionally, only 68% screened in prior 3 years).",This community-based RCT was conducted in four Appalachian Kentucky counties (December 2005-June 2008). Women aged 40-64 and overdue for screening were recruited from churches and individually randomized to treatment (n=176) or wait-list control (n=169). The intervention provided LHA home visits and newsletters addressing barriers to screening. Self-reported Pap test receipt was the primary outcome.,"Intention-to-treat analyses revealed that treatment group participants (17.6% screened) had over twice the odds of wait-list controls (11.2% screened) of reporting Pap test receipt post-intervention, OR=2.56, 95% CI: 1.03-6.38, p=0.04. Independent of group, recently screened participants (last Pap &gt;1 but &lt;5 years ago) had significantly higher odds of obtaining screening during the study than rarely or never screened participants (last Pap \u22655 years ago), OR=2.50, 95% CI: 1.48-4.25, p=0.001.",The intervention was associated with increased cervical cancer screening. The faith-placed LHA addressing barriers comprises a novel approach to reducing cervical cancer disparities among Appalachian women.
555,15020173,Research has established the societal cost-effectiveness of providing breast and cervical cancer screening to women. Less is known about the cost of motivating women significantly overdue for services to receive screening.,"In this intent-to-treat study, a total of 254 women, aged 52-69, who were overdue for both Pap test and mammography, were randomized to two groups, a tailored, motivational outreach or usual care. For effectiveness, we calculated the percent of women who received both services within 14 months of randomization. We used a comprehensive cost model to estimate total cost, per-participant cost, and the incremental cost-effectiveness of delivering the outreach intervention from the health plan perspective. We also conducted sensitivity analyses around two key parameters, target population size and level of effectiveness.","Compared with usual care, outreach (P = 0.006) screened significantly more women. The intervention cost US dollars 167.62 (2000 U.S. dollars) for each woman randomized to outreach, and incremental cost-effectiveness of outreach over usual care was US dollars 818 per additional woman screened. Sensitivity analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness between Us dollars 19 and US dollars 90 per additional woman screened.",Larger health plans can likely increase Pap test and mammography services in this population for a relatively low cost using this outreach intervention.
556,22416791,"Inadequate screening adherence for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer among Latinas places them at greater risk for poor survival rates, once diagnosed. The purpose of this study was to examine two delivery methods of lay health educators (promotoras de salud) to increase screening behavior and evaluate costs.","This community-based group randomized trial assigned Latinas due for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening (n=1006) to promotora-taught cancer screening/prevention classes delivered individually (IND) or in social support groups (SSG) over 8 weeks. Screening behaviors were assessed immediately after and 3 and 15 months after intervention. Intervention costs per study arm were compared.","Screening and maintenance behaviors were not significantly different between SSG and IND for any one type of cancer screening, but with a study entry requirement that participants were either never screened or due for screening, postintervention screening rates (that is, completing a screening that was due) were notable (39.4% and 45.5%, respectively). The cost of achieving any one screening was much higher for IND participants.","SSG vs. IND delivery did not significantly affect cancer screening behaviors, but both interventions produced robust achievement of screenings for previously nonadherent participants. Group-based promotora-led interventions supporting social involvement are recommended as a more cost-effective approach to achieving cancer screening among Latina women."
557,22493463,"Despite evidence that several colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies can reduce CRC mortality, screening rates remain low. This study aimed to determine whether the approach by which screening is recommended influences adherence.","We used a cluster randomization design with clinic time block as the unit of randomization. Persons at average risk for development of CRC in a racially/ethnically diverse urban setting were randomized to receive recommendation for screening by fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), colonoscopy, or their choice of FOBT or colonoscopy. The primary outcome was completion of CRC screening within 12 months after enrollment, defined as performance of colonoscopy, or 3 FOBT cards plus colonoscopy for any positive FOBT result. Secondary analyses evaluated sociodemographic factors associated with completion of screening.","A total of 997 participants were enrolled; 58% completed the CRC screening strategy they were assigned or chose. However, participants who were recommended colonoscopy completed screening at a significantly lower rate (38%) than participants who were recommended FOBT (67%) (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.001) or given a choice between FOBT or colonoscopy (69%) (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.001). Latinos and Asians (primarily Chinese) completed screening more often than African Americans. Moreover, nonwhite participants adhered more often to FOBT, while white participants adhered more often to colonoscopy.","The common practice of universally recommending colonoscopy may reduce adherence to CRC screening, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. Significant variation in overall and strategy-specific adherence exists between racial/ethnic groups; however, this may be a proxy for health beliefs and/or language. These results suggest that patient preferences should be considered when making CRC screening recommendations. Trial Registration\u00a0 clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00705731."
558,11890101,"Esophageal cancer (EC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Linzhou (formerly Linxian) and Huixian of Henan province, northern China, which has been well recognized as the highest incidence area for EC. The lack of useful chemoprevention agents and early detection methods is the key factors for stable EC incidence in these areas. Human esophageal carcinogensis has been considered as a multistep progressive process. The natural history for EC, however is not very clear.","Follow-up studies with linear repeated biopsies and histopathological examination were performed on 778 subjects from Linzhou and Huixian. Of these subjects, 578 subjects were followed for 11 years (1989-2000), 400 subjects with different severity of esophageal precancerous lesions were randomly divided into 2 groups for intervention studies with calcium and decaffeinated green tea (DGT). Each group included 200 subjects (100 subjects for treatment, and 100 subjects for placebo). In calcium group, each subject received an oral supplementation of 1,200 mg of calcium daily for 11 months. In DGT group, each subject received 5 mg of DGT daily for 12 months. In placebo group, each subject received placebo pill for 11 months (calcium group) and 12 month (DGT group). At the entry and the end of the trial, esophageal biopsy specimens were taken at the middle and the lower thirds of the esophagus and from macroscopic lesions, if only, of each subject.","DGT trail did not show apparent difference between the treatment and placebo group in alleviating the esophageal precancerous lesions and abnormal cell proliferation. For the calcium intervention study, after 11 years' follow-up, 10 subjects had developed into cancers in the calcium group (10%, 8 EC and 2 GCA), and 8 subjects developed into EC in the placebo group (8%). All these patients were diagnosed at very early stage of cancer (symptom-free). Of the 578 subjects, 25 (18 males and 7 females) had developed into EC (n = 23, 4.3%) and gastric cardia cancer (GCA, n = 2, 0.3%), during the 11 years' follow-up. The mean time of cancer development (from entry of the follow-up study to the cancer detection) was 5.0 +/- 2.9 years (males) and 4.7 +/- 3.2 years (females). Of the 25 patients with EC and GCA, 11 were from the 387 followed subjects with &quot;normal&quot; histomorphology of biopsy at the entry of the follow-up study (3%, 11/387), 2 were from the subjects with basal cell hyperplasia, grade I (BCH I, 2%, 2/94), 7 from the subjects with BCH grade II (BCH II, 10%, 7/72), and 5 from BCH III and dysplasia (20%, 5/25).",DGT trail was not shown to have beneficial effects in alleviating esophageal precancerous lesions and abnormal cell proliferation patterns. Calcium supplementation did not produce apparent long-term effects on EC. BCH II could be considered as precancerous lesions of EC. The quantitative histopathological analysis in terms of number of proliferating basal cell layers is of importance in determining the high-risk subjects for EC and evaluating the intervention results. Follow-up studies with repeated endoscopic biopsies are the powerful strategy for early detection and mortality control of EC and GAC in the high incidence area.

Interestingly, patients reported less psychological distress in the follow-up period after eMBCT in comparison to MBCT. Less psychological distress, rumination and neuroticism, and more extraversion and agreeableness at baseline predicted less psychological distress at the nine-month follow-up after both interventions. Less mindful and conscientious patients at baseline benefited more from eMBCT than from MBCT. Regarding working mechanisms, changes in mindfulness skills, fear of cancer recurrence and rumination during both interventions predicted less psychological distress at follow-up.","Our findings suggest most improvements in cancer patients' increase over time after both interventions. Furthermore, patients seemed to benefit more from eMBCT than MBCT based on psychological distress levels, especially those patients with low levels of mindfulness skills and conscientiousness."
560,9839524,"Estrogens have been implicated in the development of breast cancer. Preliminary evidence suggests that consumption of soy products, which contain isoflavones (phytoestrogens), can reduce serum estrogen levels. Our purpose was to determine the effect of soy consumption on serum estrogen levels in premenopausal women by use of a dietary intervention approach.",Premenopausal Japanese women were randomly assigned to receive either a soymilk-supplemented diet (n = 31) or a normal (control) diet (n = 29). The women in the soymilk-supplemented group were asked to consume about 400 mL of soymilk (containing about 109 mg of isoflavones) daily during a study period that involved three consecutive menstrual cycles. Follicular-phase blood samples were to be obtained in the menstrual cycles preceding (cycle 1) and following (cycle 3) the 2-month dietary intervention. All statistical tests were two-sided.,"At the end of the study period, estrone and estradiol levels were decreased by 23% and 27%, respectively, in the soymilk-supplemented group and were increased by 0.6% and 4%, respectively, in the control group. The changes for each hormone between the two groups were not statistically significantly different. In the soymilk-supplemented group, menstrual cycle length was increased by nearly 2 days, and, in the control group, it was decreased by approximately 1 day, a difference that was not statistically significant. A subgroup analysis restricted to subjects who provided follicular-phase blood samples on the same day or 1 day apart in menstrual cycles 1 and 3 showed a reduction in serum estrone levels in the soymilk-supplemented group that was of borderline statistical significance (P = .07 for change in serum estrone level in soymilk-supplemented group versus control group).",Much larger studies will be required to confirm the ability of soy products to reduce serum estrogen levels.

After intervention, there was a significant mean difference in SWB (p\u202f=\u202f.001), RWB (p\u202f=\u202f.013) and EWB (p\u202f=\u202f.001) in two groups.",Spiritual counseling is associated with significant improvements in SWB in Iranian women with cancer. Interventions that acknowledge the spiritual needs of these patients should be incorporated into conventional treatments.
564,29243165,We hypothesized exercise training-induced improvements in ease of walking would associate with favorable changes in objectively measured physical activity (PA) and self-reported depressive symptoms following a PA behavior-change intervention in non-metastatic breast cancer survivors (BCS).,"Twenty-seven BCS received random assignment to an intervention (INT) or control group (CON). INT included counseling/group discussions coupled with supervised exercise tapered to unsupervised exercise. PA, depressive symptoms, and ease of walking were evaluated pre-/post-intervention using 10-day accelerometry, HADS depression subscale, and indirect calorimetry during a standardized treadmill test, respectively. PA composite score was calculated by converting weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA and average steps/day to z-scores then dividing the sum by 2. Cardiac efficiency was determined by dividing steady-state oxygen uptake by heart rate to evaluate the volume of oxygen consumed per heartbeat.","ANCOVA revealed a significant time by group interaction showing the INT group exhibited greater positive changes in the PA composite compared to the CON (INT, +\u20090.14\u2009\u00b1\u20090.66 au vs. CON, -\u20090.48\u2009\u00b1\u20090.49 au; p\u2009=\u20090.019; \u03b7 \u2009=\u20090.21). Changes occurring from baseline to follow-up, among all participants, revealed improved ease of walking (less oxygen uptake) associated with increased PA composite (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.52; p\u2009=\u20090.010) and lower depressive symptomology (r\u2009=\u20090.50; p\u2009=\u20090.012) adjusted for age, race, and months since cancer diagnosis. Increased cardiac efficiency during the standardized treadmill test also associated with less daily sedentary time (r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.52; p\u2009=\u20090.021).","These data support the assertion that reducing the physiological difficulty of walking may contribute to greater engagement in free-living PA, less sedentary time, and decreased psychosocial distress among BCS."
565,12525530,"Although tobacco use by cancer patients increases the risk of relapse, diminishes treatment efficacy, and worsens quality of life, about one third of patients who smoked before their diagnosis continue to smoke. Because patients have regular contact with oncologists, the efficacy of a physician-based smoking cessation treatment was evaluated.",Cancer patients (n = 432) were randomly assigned to either usual care or a National Institutes of Health (NIH) physician-based smoking intervention. The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 and 12 months after study entry.,"At the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in quit rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention (13.3%) groups at the 12-month follow-up. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 6 months if they had head and neck or lung cancer, began smoking after the age of 16, reported at baseline using a cessation self-help guide or treatment in the last 6 months, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Patients were more likely to have quit smoking at 12 months if they smoked 15 or fewer cigarettes per day, had head and neck or lung cancer, tried a group cessation program, and showed greater baseline desire to quit. Finally, there was greater adherence among physicians to the NIH model for physician smoking treatment for patients in the intervention versus the usual care group.","While training physicians to provide smoking cessation treatment to cancer patients can enhance physician adherence to clinical practice guidelines, physician smoking cessation interventions fail to yield significant gains in long-term quit rates among cancer patients."
566,28703440,"This study was conducted in order to examine the effects of community-based education on cervical cancer prevention in relation to South Korean mothers' knowledge about the Papanicolau (Pap) test and human papillomavirus, self-confidence in communication with their daughters, and health-related beliefs about their daughters.","A quasi-experimental pre-post design was used. For the experimental group, face-to-face education was administered to 35 participants for 60\u2009min. For the control group, 35 participants were taught by using standardized materials for 20\u2009min.","The experimental group showed a significant increase in Pap test knowledge, cervical cancer knowledge, and self-confidence in communication with their daughters, compared to the control group. In the post-test, the mothers in the experimental group also perceived cervical cancer as more threatening, their daughter as more susceptible to cervical cancer, Pap tests as being recommended for their daughters, and they showed a significant increase in their self-efficacy of recommending the Pap test to their daughter.","Community-based education for mothers is effective in increasing their human papillomavirus knowledge, Pap test knowledge, improving their confidence in communication with their daughters, and in some of the health-related beliefs regarding their daughters."
567,9808823,"This study evaluated the impact of a telephone outcall intervention (based on the Transtheoretical Model) on screening mammography behavior among lower income, older women.","A geodemographic database, INFORUM, was used to identify low-income and minority neighborhoods throughout the state of Colorado. Residences were assigned randomly to three study groups: (1) control, (2) outcall only, and (3) advance &quot;invitation&quot; + outcall. Information Specialists of the Cancer Information Service implemented the protocol. Mammography adherence was assessed in telephone interviews conducted 6 months and 2 years after the initial call.","Neither intervention had a significant effect on the main outcome, receipt of mammography in the 6-month follow-up period. At 6 months, intentions to have a mammogram were significantly stronger in the intervention groups compared with the control group, particularly among those who were precontemplators at baseline. The 2-year follow-up indicated a small increase in mammography adherence attributable to the advance invitation + outcall, but this effect was restricted to those adherent at baseline. Mammography behavior during the 6-month follow-up period was predicted strongly by decisional balance, intentions, receipt of a physical and clinical breast exam, and previous mammography behavior.","The intervention promoted minimal movement in the stages of change for mammography. Outcall interventions may have promise for encouraging repeat mammography behavior, but more intensive interventions are likely to be necessary to promote behavior change among nonadherent women."
568,10228816,The impact of psychotherapeutic support on survival time in patients with gastrointestinal cancer undergoing surgery was studied.,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted in cooperation with the Departments of General Surgery and Medical Psychology, University Hospital of Hamburg, Germany. Two hundred and seventy-one consenting patients with a preliminary diagnosis of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, liver/gallbladder, pancreas or colon/rectum were stratified by gender and randomly assigned to a control group that received standard care, as provided on the surgical wards, or to an experimental group that received formal psychotherapeutic support in addition to routine care during the hospital stay. Patients in both groups completed the EORTC-Quality of Life questionnaire pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery. Date of death, if applicable, was also recorded. Unadjusted and adjusted survival analyses were performed.","Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated better survival for the experimental group than for the control group. The unadjusted significance level for group differences was p = 0.002 for survival up to 2 years. Cox regression models that took TNM Staging or the Residual Tumor Classification into account also found significant differences at the 2-year follow-up. Secondary analyses found that most of the differences in favor of the experimental group occurred in females and in patients with stomach, pancreatic, primary liver or colorectal cancer.","The results of this study indicate that patients with gastrointestinal cancer, particularly those who are female and those who undergo surgery for stomach, pancreatic, primary liver or colorectal cancer, benefit from a formal program of psychotherapeutic support in terms of survival."
569,19061198,"We conducted pilot studies of the feasibility and efficacy of an interactive, computerized educational tool, Banking on Fatherhood (BOF).","Two small randomized trials were conducted, with 20 male cancer patients eligible to bank sperm in Study 1 and 19 oncology fellows or residents in Study 2. In each trial, half of the subjects viewed BOF before completing questionnaires, and half viewed it afterward. Outcome measures included a knowledge test in both trials and a Decisional Conflict scale in the patient trial. All participants, plus a panel of 10 experts, ultimately viewed BOF and completed a form evaluating its usability and value.","Patients who completed questionnaires after viewing BOF had significantly less decisional conflict about banking sperm than those who had not viewed it (P=0.0065), but knowledge scores were not significantly different between groups. Physicians who filled out questionnaires after viewing BOF scored significantly higher on the knowledge test (P&lt;0.006). Patients, physicians and experts rated BOF as easy to use, informative and addressing important psychosocial concerns, with videos and animations adding to the value of the educational tool.",Pilot studies suggest that BOF is a feasible intervention that could enhance decisions about sperm banking. Research with larger groups is needed to validate its effectiveness.
570,23210527,This randomized controlled trial examines whether a briefer cognitive-behavioural (CBT) stress management intervention than the norm can reduce stress and distress and enhance benefit finding in women with breast cancer. It further aims to identify characteristics of those women most likely to benefit from the intervention.,"A randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of a psychological intervention. Women (N = 355) who had undergone surgery for breast cancer 4 months earlier, the majority of whom were currently undergoing adjuvant therapy, completed questionnaires assessing global and cancer-specific stress, depression, anxiety, optimism and benefit finding. They were randomly assigned to a 5-week group cognitive-behavioural stress management (CBSM) programme plus standard care or standard care only. Reassessment occurred post-intervention and 12 months later.","Analyses of variance revealed that patients who received the intervention showed significant lowering of global stress and anxiety and increased benefit finding compared to controls. These differences, however, were not maintained at 12 months. Effects of the intervention were moderated by stress such that women with high global stress at baseline showed greater reduction in both stress and anxiety.","A CBSM intervention, which was briefer than the norm (5 weeks vs. 9-20 weeks), had beneficial effects on adjustment for women with breast cancer and was particularly effective for those with increased global stress. Screening on this basis may facilitate optimal and cost-effective psychological treatment."
571,30343455,"Breast cancer (BC) is a risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet little research has tested the efficacy of different psychotherapies for depressed women with BC. This study, the largest to date, compared outcomes of three evidence-based, 12-week therapies in treating major depressive disorder among women with breast cancer.","This randomized trial compared interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), problem solving therapy (PST), and brief supportive psychotherapy (BSP). Conducted at the outpatient clinic of the New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University, the trial offered bilingual treatment by treatment-specific psychotherapists supervised by treatment experts. The primary outcome was change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) at 12\u00a0weeks. Secondary outcomes included other validated patient-reported outcomes for depression and quality of life.","Of 179 women with breast cancer screening positive for depression at the Columbia Cancer Center, 134 eligible patients signed informed treatment consent. Half of patients were Hispanic and economically disadvantaged. Most women had stage I (35.2%) or II (36.9%) BC; 9% had stage IV. The three brief psychotherapies showed similar improvements on the HAM-D, with large pre-post effect sizes (d\u2009~\u20091.0); a priori defined response rates were 35% for IPT, 50% for PST and 31% for BSP, and remission rates 25%, 30% and 27%, respectively. The three treatments also showed similar improvements in the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Dropout was high, ranging from 37 to 52% across treatments. Predictors of dropout included having\u2009&lt;\u200916\u00a0years of education and annual family income &lt;\u2009$20,000.","Among patients who completed treatment, all three psychotherapies were associated with similar, meaningful improvements in depression. Physical distance between the oncology and psychiatric treatment sites might have contributed to high dropout. This study suggests various psychotherapy approaches may benefit patients with breast cancer and major depression."
572,30107070,"In response to the well-documented need for evidence-based cancer caregiver support, we examined the feasibility of problem-solving therapy for family caregivers of cancer patients receiving outpatient palliative care and investigated the impact of problem-solving therapy on family caregivers' anxiety, depression, and quality of life.","We conducted a feasibility study of a structured problem-solving therapy intervention delivered to family caregivers of cancer patients receiving outpatient palliative care from an academic health center in the Midwestern United States. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a083) were randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care plus a problem-solving therapy intervention, which was delivered over three sessions via web-based videoconferencing or telephone. Descriptive statistics were used to determine feasibility relative to recruitment, retention, and fidelity to core intervention components. Outcome data were analyzed using ordinary least squares multiple regression.",Problem-solving therapy for family caregivers of patients with cancer was found to be highly feasible in the outpatient palliative care setting. Caregivers who received problem-solving therapy reported less anxiety than those who received only usual care (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). No statistically significant differences were observed for caregiver depression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.07) or quality of life (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06).,Problem-solving therapy is a feasible and promising approach to reducing cancer family caregivers' anxiety in the outpatient palliative care setting. Further testing in multiple sites is recommended.
573,16965740,"To investigate the immunoregulation and short-term therapeutic effects of super-selective intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with Fuzheng Kang'ai Granules, a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on patients with late gastric cancer.","Forty patients with late gastric antrum cancer were randomly divided into study group and control group. Patients in the study group were orally administered Fuzheng Kang'ai Granules 48 hours after the first super-selective left gastric artery chemotherapy with high-dose drugs (EAP regime: VP(16) 100 mg/m(2) + epirubicin 60 mg/m(2) + carboplatin 200 mg/m(2)), while patients in the control group were only administered the same local artery chemotherapy as in the study group.","The short-term therapeutic efficacy in the study group and control group were 82.5% and 57.5% respectively (P&lt;0.01). The occurrence rates of side effects in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P&lt;0.01). The Karnofsky score of life quality of the study group was obviously higher than that of the control group after treatment (P&lt;0.05). The half survival time and one year survival rate in the study group and control group were (24.9 +/- 1.36) month, 70% (28/40) and (13.7 +/- 0.72) month, 35% (14/40) respectively. They were significantly improved in the study group compared with the control group (P&lt;0.01). The levels of cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) after treatment in the study group were significantly higher than those before treatment (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01), as well as than those after treatment in the control group (P&lt;0.01). On the other hand, the level of immune inhibitory factor soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) after treatment in the study group was lower than that before treatment, as well as than that after treatment in the control group (P&lt;0.01).","The super-selective intra-arterial chemotherapy combined with Fuzheng Kang'ai Granules has good short-term therapeutic efficiency and few side effects for patients with late gastric antrum cancer. It can significantly improve the life quality, extend the survival period, and improve the survival rate in patients with late gastric antrum cancer, which may be due to the up-regulation of the immune regulating factors such as IL-2, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and down-regulation of the immune inhibitory factor sIL-2R."
574,15084618,"The effectiveness of nonsteroid topical agents for the prevention of acute dermatitis during adjuvant radiotherapy for breast carcinoma has not been demonstrated. The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of calendula (Pommade au Calendula par Digestion; Boiron Ltd, Levallois-Perret, France) with that of trolamine (Biafine; Genmedix Ltd, France), which is considered in many institutions to be the reference topical agent.","Between July 1999 and June 2001, 254 patients who had been operated on for breast cancer and who were to receive postoperative radiation therapy were randomly allocated to application of either trolamine (128 patients) or calendula (126 patients) on the irradiated fields after each session. The primary end point was the occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher. Prognostic factors, including treatment modalities and patient characteristics, were also investigated. Secondary end points were the occurrence of pain, the quantity of topical agent used, and patient satisfaction.","The occurrence of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher was significantly lower (41% v 63%; P &lt;.001) with the use of calendula than with trolamine. Moreover, patients receiving calendula had less frequent interruption of radiotherapy and significantly reduced radiation-induced pain. Calendula was considered to be more difficult to apply, but self-assessed satisfaction was greater. Body mass index and adjuvant chemotherapy before radiotherapy after lumpectomy were significant prognostic factors for acute dermatitis.",Calendula is highly effective for the prevention of acute dermatitis of grade 2 or higher and should be proposed for patients undergoing postoperative irradiation for breast cancer.
575,10197829,We report a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of education-based and peer discussion-based group interventions on adjustment to breast cancer.,"Women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer (n = 312) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 group conditions: control, education, peer discussion, or education plus peer discussion (combination). Seven groups (each comprising 8-12 women) were conducted in each of the 4 conditions (28 groups total). Adjustment was measured before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and 6 months after the intervention.","Consistently positive effects on adjustment were seen in the education groups both immediately following and 6 months after the intervention. There were no benefits of participation in peer discussion groups, and some indications of adverse effects on adjustment at both follow-up examinations. The effects could be explained by changes in self-esteem, body image, and intrusive thoughts about the illness.",Education-based group interventions facilitated the initial adjustment of women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. There was no evidence of benefits from peer discussion group interventions.
576,15241836,The authors undertook a multiinstitutional Phase II cooperative group study to examine the potential of oral fish oil fatty acid supplements administered at high doses to slow weight loss and to improve quality of life in patients with malignancy-related cachexia.,"Patients with advanced malignancy and weight loss &gt; or = 2% of body weight in the preceding month took concentrated, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid capsules (7.5 g eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid for a 70 kg individual) that were supplied by the National Institutes of Health.","Forty-three patients with moderate or severe malnutrition were enrolled. The median time receiving treatment was 1.2 months. For the 36 patients who took at least 1 capsule and did not have edema, there was a weight change ranging from -6.2 kg to +3.5 kg and an overall median weight loss of 0.8 kg. Twenty-four patients had weight stabilization (a gain of &lt; or = 5% or a loss of &lt; 5%), 6 patients gained &gt; 5% of their body weight, and 6 patients lost &gt; or = 5% of their body weight. There was marked variability in the tolerability of the capsules, and many patients had gastrointestinal side effects. There was a correlation between time receiving treatment and weight gain for the 22 patients who were able to tolerate the capsules for at least 1 month. Quality-of-life scores were superior for patients who gained weight.","A majority of patients did not gain weight, and in that sense, the results of the study were unfavorable. However, a small but definite subset of patients had weight stabilization or weight gain. This suggests that omega-3 fatty acids have potential utility at the study doses, which were more than twice the doses used in published Phase III studies."
577,17647221,This study was designed to replicate our earlier finding that intensive group therapy extended survival time of women with metastatic breast cancer. Subsequent findings concerning the question of whether such psychosocial support affects survival have been mixed.,"One hundred twenty-five women with confirmed metastatic (n = 122) or locally recurrent (n = 3) breast cancer were randomly assigned either to the supportive-expressive group therapy condition (n = 64), where they received educational materials plus weekly supportive-expressive group therapy, or to the control condition (n = 61), where they received only educational materials for a minimum of 1 year. The treatment, 90 minutes once a week, was designed to build new bonds of social support, encourage expression of emotion, deal with fears of dying and death, help restructure life priorities, improve communication with family members and healthcare professionals, and enhance control of pain and anxiety.","Overall mortality after 14 years was 86%; median survival time was 32.8 months. No overall statistically significant effect of treatment on survival was found for treatment (median, 30.7 months) compared with control (median, 33.3 months) patients, but there was a statistically significant intervention site-by-condition interaction. Exploratory moderator analysis to explain that interaction revealed a significant overall interaction between estrogen-receptor (ER) status and treatment condition (P = .002) such that among the 25 ER-negative participants, those randomized to treatment survived longer (median, 29.8 months) than ER-negative controls (median, 9.3 months), whereas the ER-positive participants showed no treatment effect.","The earlier finding that longer survival was associated with supportive-expressive group therapy was not replicated. Although it is possible that psychosocial effects on survival are relevant to a small subsample of women who are more refractory to current hormonal treatments, further research is required to investigate subgroup differences."
578,18198648,To investigate the effect of integrative Chinese and Western medical therapy for radiative pneumonia (RP).,"Eighty patients were randomly assigned to two groups. The treated group (48 patients) was treated by Shenqi Fuzheng Injection (SFI), antibiotics and short-term pulse therapy with high efficient hormone, while the control group (32 patients) was treated only by antibiotic and hormone pulse therapy. Changes of symptoms, signs, quality of life and subsets of T-lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio) were observed before and after 20-day treatment.","The chief symptom disappearance time was shorter (P &lt; 0.05), Karnofsky performance score was better (P &lt; 0.05) in the treated group after treatment as compared with those in the control group. Moreover, the immune function was improved in the treated group after treatment (P &lt; 0.01).","SFI combined with antibiotics and short-term pulse therapy with high efficient hormone has a good effect for radiative pneumonia, it could also increase patients' quality of life as well."
579,23109700,We aimed to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with breast cancer.,"We conducted a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture with enhanced usual care. Three hundred two outpatients with breast cancer participated. We randomly assigned 75 patients to usual care and 227 patients to acupuncture plus usual care (random assignment of 1:3 respectively) with minimization controlling for baseline general fatigue and maintenance treatment. Treatment was delivered by acupuncturists once a week for 6 weeks through needling three pairs of acupoints. The usual care group received a booklet with information about fatigue and its management. Primary outcome was general fatigue at 6 weeks, measured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI). Other measurements included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General quality-of-life scale, and expectation of acupuncture effect. Analyses were by intention to treat.","Two hundred forty-six of 302 patients randomly assigned provided complete data at 6 weeks. The difference in the mean General Fatigue score, between those who received the intervention and those who did not, was -3.11 (95% CI, -3.97 to -2.25; P &lt; .001). The intervention also improved all other fatigue aspects measured by MFI, including Physical Fatigue and Mental Fatigue (acupuncture effect, -2.36 and -1.94, respectively; both at P &lt; .001), anxiety and depression (acupuncture effect, -1.83 and -2.13, respectively; both at P &lt; .001), and quality of life (Physical Well-Being effect, 3.30; Functional Well-Being effect, 3.57; both at P &lt; .001; Emotional Well-Being effect, 1.93; P = .001; and Social Functioning Well-Being effect, 1.05; P &lt; .05).",Acupuncture is an effective intervention for managing the symptom of CRF and improving patients' quality of life.
580,23019941,To study the adjunctive roles of Qingliu Lianghou Recipe (QLR) in treatment of hypopharyngeal carcinoma.,"A total of 156 patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were recruited, including 21 cases of stage I, 34 in stage II, 55 in stage III, and 46 in stage IV. Of them, 31 patients (Group A) were managed with operation and post-operative radiotherapy, 40 patients (Group B) with operation, post-operative radiotherapy, and QLR, 45 patients (Group C) were managed with concomitant chemoradiotherapy, 40 patients (Group D)with concomitant chemoradiation and QLR. QLR was given for 12 weeks. The radio- and chemotoxic reactions, quality of life (KPS score), and long-term efficacy (the recurrence time and the survival time) were observed.","The toxicity levels were significantly lower in Group B than in Group A, manifested as radioactive dermatitis, mucositis, dysphagia, changes in body weight, and lymphatic edema (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). The toxicity levels were significantly lower in Group D than in Group C, manifested as radioactive dermatitis, mucositis, dysphagia, marrow depression, changes in body weight, and gastrointestinal reactions (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). After treatment the KPS scores of all patients obviously decreased (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). But the KPS scores were significantly higher in Group B than in Group A (P &lt; 0.05), and they were significantly higher in Group D than in Group C (P &lt; 0.05). The 3-year recurrence rate of patients in Group A was 41.94%, 20.00% in Group B, 60.00% in Group C, and 37.50% in Group D (P &lt; 0.05). The 5-year survival rate of patients in Group A was 38.71%, 62.50% in Group B, 22.22% in Group C, and 42.50% in Group D (P &lt; 0.05).","QLR could effectively prevent and reduce the toxicity response caused by operation, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The combination therapy of integrative medicine could postpone the recurrence and prolong the lifespan of patients. Therefore, we must not neglect the adjunctive therapy of QLR in treating hypopharyngeal carcinoma."
581,16437375,To study the protective effect of glutamine (Gln) on intestinal permeability in patients receiving chemotherapy.,"Thirty-nine patients with gastrointestinal cancer after operation were randomly divided into Gln and control groups, and received oral administration of glutamine (30 g/d) for 7 days (n=22) or not (n=17). All patients received CF+ 5-FU chemotherapy for 5 days. Serum concentration of glutamine and urinary lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratio were measured before and 1 day after chemotherapy.","After chemotherapy, the serum Gln concentration was significantly decreased to (535.42+/- 53.75) micromol/L in the control group and increased to (54.44+/- 81.26) micromol/L in the Gln group, and there was significant difference between the two groups (P&lt; 0.01). Urine L/M ratio was significantly increased to (0.0453+/- 0.0078) in the control group and decreased to (0.0331+/- 0.0061) in the Gln group, and there was significant difference between the two groups after chemotherapy (P&lt; 0.01).","Oral administration of glutamine granules can increase serum concentration of glutamine in chemotherapy patients with gastrointestinal cancer and can decrease intestinal permeability, maintain intestinal barrier."
582,16417695,To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three methods of inviting women with a long history of non-attendance to undergo cervical screening.,"Randomized controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis. In all, 1140 women were identified from routine NHS screening records as having no smear for at least 15 years and randomly allocated to receive a telephone call from a nurse, a letter from a well-known celebrity (Claire Rayner) or letter from the local NHS Cervical Screening Commissioner. Uptake of screening was measured using routine data and attributed to interventions if occurring within three months. Uptake was compared with a control group. Costs of carrying out the interventions were noted from the perspective of the NHS and cost-effectiveness, as cost per additional attender, calculated.","Uptake following all interventions was low: telephone call (1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-3.6%); celebrity letter (1.8, 95% CI 0.57-4.0%); commissioner letter (4.6, 95% CI 2.5-7.7%); control group (1.8, 95% CI 0.57-4.0%). There were no significant differences between groups. Telephone intervention was not possible in a quarter of women whose numbers were unlisted. Telephone intervention was the most expensive and least effective of the interventions. The commissioner letter yielded an additional attender within three months at an incremental cost of 23.21 pounds compared with taking no action.","Neither a telephone call from a nurse nor a letter from a celebrity to encourage attendance for cervical screening were effective or cost-effective in women with a prolonged history of non-participation in the screening programme. A letter from the local cervical screening programme commissioner resulted in a small, non-significant increase in uptake. The low cost and ease of implementation of this intervention supports further research into its use in routine practice."
583,17661342,"It has been shown that nonpharmacologic interventions are effective management techniques for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in cancer survivors. However, few studies have investigated their effectiveness in patients who are receiving chemotherapy. In this study, the authors tested the effectiveness of a brief behaviorally oriented intervention in reducing CRF and improving physical function and associated distress in individuals who were receiving chemotherapy.","For this randomized controlled trial, 60 patients with cancer were recruited and received either usual care or the intervention. The intervention was delivered on an individual basis on 3 occasions over a period from 9 weeks to 12 weeks, and the objective of the intervention was to alter fatigue-related thoughts and behavior. Primary outcomes were assessed as follows: CRF using the Visual Analogue Scale-Global Fatigue; physical functioning using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Core 30 Questionnaire, and CRF-associated distress using the Fatigue Outcome Measure. Assessments were made on 4 occasions: at baseline (T0), at the end of chemotherapy (T1), 1 month after chemotherapy (T2), and 9 months after recruitment (T3). Normally distributed data were analyzed using t tests and random-slope/random-intercept mixed models.","The intervention demonstrated a trend toward improved CRF, although this effect was reduced once confounders had been controlled statistically. There was a significant improvement in physical functioning (coefficient, 10.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-17.5; P = .009), and this effect remained once the confounding effects of mood disturbance and comorbid disorders were controlled statistically. No decrease in fatigue-related distress was detected.","The behaviorally oriented intervention brought about significant improvements in physical functioning, indicated a trend toward improved CRF, but detected no effect for fatigue-related distress."
584,28169575,"The ENGAGE (efficacy of a referral and physical activity program for survivors of prostate cancer) study established that a clinician referral and 12-week exercise training program increased vigorous physical activity at 12 weeks among men with prostate cancer. Here, we report the 6- and 12-month outcomes.","In this multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial, we compared a clinician referral and exercise training program to usual care. Discounted gym membership was offered to men in the intervention condition on completion of the 12-week exercise program. Self-reported physical activity at 6 and 12 months was the primary outcome. Quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were secondary outcomes.","A total of 147 men meeting eligibility criteria agreed to participate (54 intervention, 93 control). A positive interaction effect for vigorous physical activity was observed at 6 months, but not 12 months. No significant effects for the secondary outcomes were found.","A clinician referral and community-based supervised and unsupervised exercise training program, along with discounted gym membership, had a positive short-term effect on vigorous physical activity levels, but did not improve quality of life, in men with prostate cancer."
585,29624807,"Meaning-centered group psychotherapy for cancer survivors (MCGP-CS) improves meaning, psychological well-being, and mental adjustment to cancer and reduces psychological distress. This randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the cost-utility of MCGP-CS compared with supportive group psychotherapy (SGP) and care-as-usual (CAU).","In total, 170 patients were randomized to MCGP-CS, SGP, or CAU. Intervention costs, direct medical and nonmedical costs, productivity losses, and health-related quality of life were measured until 6\u00a0months follow-up, using the TIC-P, PRODISQ, data from the hospital information system, and the EQ-5D. The cost-utility was calculated by comparing mean cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).","Mean total costs ranged from \u20ac4492 (MCGP-CS) to \u20ac5304 (CAU). Mean QALYs ranged .507 (CAU) to .540 (MCGP-CS). MCGP-CS had a probability of 74% to be both less costly and more effective than CAU, and 49% compared with SGP. Sensitivity analyses showed these findings are robust. If society is willing to pay \u20ac0 for one gained QALY, MCGP-CS has a 78% probability of being cost-effective compared with CAU. This increases to 85% and 92% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of \u20ac10\u00a0000 and \u20ac30\u00a0000, which are commonly accepted thresholds.","MCGP-CS is highly likely a cost-effective intervention, meaning that there is a positive balance between the costs and gains of MCGP-CS, in comparison with SGP and CAU."
586,8635032,This investigation examined factors affecting patient involvement in consultations to decide local treatment for early breast cancer and the effectiveness of two methods of preconsultation education aimed at increasing patient participation in these discussions.,"Sixty patients with Stage I or II breast cancer (1) were pretested on their knowledge about breast cancer treatment and optimism for the future, (2) were randomly assigned to one of two methods for preconsultation education: interactive multimedia program or brochure, (3) completed knowledge and optimism measures, (4) consulted with a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and general surgeon, and (5) completed self-report measures assessing their involvement in the consultations and control over decision-making. The consultations were audiorecorded and analyzed to identify behavioral indicators of patient involvement (question-asking, opinion-giving, and expressing concern) and physician utterances encouraging patient participation.","College-educated patients younger than 65 years of age were more active participants in these consultations than were older, less educated patients. In addition, patients showed more involvement when they interacted with physicians who encouraged and facilitated patient participation. The method of education did not affect patient involvement although patients tended to learn more about breast cancer treatment after using the multimedia program than after reading the brochure.","Although patients vary in their expressiveness, physicians may be able to increase patient participation in deciding treatment by using patient-centered behavior. Also, preconsultation education appears to be an effective clinical strategy for helping patients gain an accurate understanding of their treatment options before meeting with physicians."

The sustained remission time was 172 days in the treatment group and 115 days in the control group, the median survival time was 363 days and 201 days respectively. The relapse rate of the treatment group within 3 months, 6 months,1 year, and the total relapse rate was 30.0%, 50.0%, 70.0%, and 90.0%, respectively, lower than that of the control group (being 42.8%, 76.2%, 90.5%, 90.5%, respectively). The mortality rate of the treatment group was 80.0%, 5.7% lower than that of the control group (85.7%).","CZG could lengthen the sustained remission time for RAL patients, elevate their survival time, and reduce the relapse rate and the mortality rate."
588,17875274,"The Tepeyac Project is a church-based health promotion project that was conducted from 1999 through 2005 to increase breast cancer screening rates among Latinas in Colorado. Previous reports evaluated the project among Medicare and Medicaid enrollees in the state. In this report, we evaluate the program among enrollees in the state's five major insurance plans.","We compared the Tepeyac Project's two interventions: the Printed Intervention and the Promotora Intervention. In the first, we mailed culturally tailored education packages to 209 Colorado Catholic churches for their use. In the second, promotoras (peer counselors) in four Catholic churches delivered breast-health education messages personally. We compared biennial mammogram claims from the five insurance plans in the analysis at baseline (1998-1999) and during follow-up (2000-2001) for Latinas who had received the interventions. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis to adjust rates for confounders.","The mammogram rate for Latinas in the Printed Intervention remained the same from baseline to follow-up (58% [2979/5130] vs 58% [3338/5708]). In the Promotora Intervention, the rate was 59% (316/536) at baseline and 61% (359/590) at follow-up. Rates increased modestly over time and varied widely by insurance type. After adjusting for age, income, urban versus rural location, disability, and insurance type, we found that women exposed to the Promotora Intervention had a significantly higher increase in biennial mammograms than did women exposed to the Printed Intervention (GEE parameter estimate = .24 [+/-.11], P = .03).","For insured Latinas, personally delivering church-based education through peer counselors appears to be a better breast-health promotion method than mailing printed educational materials to churches."
589,18457329,Shoulder pain and disability are well recognized complications associated with surgery for head and neck cancer. This study was designed to examine the effects of progressive resistance exercise training (PRET) on upper extremity pain and dysfunction in postsurgical head and neck cancer survivors.,"Fifty-two head and neck cancer survivors were assigned randomly to PRET (n = 27) or a standardized therapeutic exercise protocol (TP) (n = 25) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in patient-rated shoulder pain and disability from baseline to postintervention. Secondary endpoints were upper extremity strength and endurance, range of motion, fatigue, and quality of life.","Follow-up assessment for the primary outcome was 92%, and adherence to the supervised PRET and TP programs were 95% and 87%, respectively. On the basis of intention-to-treat analyses, PRET was superior to TP for improving shoulder pain and disability (-9.6; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -16.4 to -4.5; P = .001), upper extremity strength (+10.8 kg; 95% CI, 5.4-16.2 kg; P &lt; .001), and upper extremity endurance (+194 repetitions x kg; 95% CI, 10-378 repetitions x kg; P = .039). Changes in neck dissection impairment, fatigue, and quality of life favored the PRET group but did not reach statistical significance.",The PRET program significantly reduced shoulder pain and disability and improved upper extremity muscular strength and endurance in head and neck cancer survivors who had shoulder dysfunction because of spinal accessory nerve damage. Clinicians should consider the addition of PRET in the rehabilitation of postsurgical head and neck cancer survivors.
590,11071838,"Reducing sun exposure during childhood may prevent skin cancer later in life. Sun protection increased immediately following implementation of the SunSafe multicomponent, community-based intervention delivered in 1996 through schools, day care centers, primary care offices, and beach recreation areas. Whether sun protection levels would remain higher than preintervention levels the following summer was unknown.","A randomized controlled trial based in 10 New Hampshire towns addressed children's use of protective clothing, shade, and sunscreen at freshwater beach areas. The intervention was provided initially between March and May 1996. A brief project follow-up contact was provided to schools, day care centers, beaches, and primary care offices between March and May 1997 to restock intervention materials and to answer questions. Observations of 1490 children during June through August of 1997 were compared with observations made prior to any intervention between June and August of 1995.","In intervention towns, the proportion of children using at least some sun protection increased by 0.15 from 0.58 in 1995 to 0.73 in 1997 while the proportion in control towns increased by 0.03 (P = 0.033). This increase was due to more use of sunscreen, but not more use of protective clothing or shade. In 1997, care-givers of children in intervention towns reported receiving more sun protection information from school and health care sources than control town caregivers (62% versus 33%, P &lt; 0.006).","In intervention communities, a higher proportion of children used sun protection in 1997 than at baseline. Increases from 1995 to 1997 were similar in magnitude to short-term increases between 1995 and 1996 that we have been previously reported."
591,9217034,"The authors previously reported a statistically significant effect of psychosocial intervention on survival time of women with metastatic breast carcinoma. In this study, the authors investigated whether this effect could be explained by differences in the medical treatment patients received subsequent to their group participation or differences in causes of death.","Of the original 86 study participants, medical treatment charts for 61 and death certificates for 83 were available for further analysis. The authors reviewed the course of the medical treatment they received subsequent to their entry into the randomized psychotherapy trial.","Although there were no statistically significant differences with regard to chemotherapy and hormone therapy between the control and treatment groups, women in the control group tended to have received more adrenalectomies, although this procedure did not account for the difference in survival time between the control group and the treatment group. Furthermore, women in the control group developed more bone and lung metastases than the women in the treatment group.",Differences in disease course between the control and treatment groups appeared to be independent of any differences in medical treatment received.
592,28102437,"Patients with advanced cancer frequently experience anxiety, depression and poor quality of life (QOL), as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue and weakness. Physical exercise has potential to help control these symptoms but the optimal training prescription is still not clear. We performed a study comparing medical Qigong (QG) and standard endurance and strength training (SET) in patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.","A randomized, cross-over study was performed in patients with advanced NSCLC and GI cancers receiving or eligible for chemotherapy. Patients received supervised QG or SET twice-weekly for 6\u00a0weeks. Psychological functioning, QOL, symptoms and physical functioning were assessed before and after each intervention period.","Nineteen patients completed both interventions. Comparing interventions revealed no difference between QG and SET on change in anxiety or depression scores or QOL. However, SET treatment was better at improving perceived strength (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and walking distance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The order in which interventions were performed had a significant impact on the improvement in certain symptoms (sleep quality, breathlessness, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05), QOL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and walking distance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). In all cases, the beneficial effects of the exercise interventions were markedly reduced during the second interval.","QG and SET are equivalent in their impact on many aspects of psychological function in cancer patients. However, SET leads to greater improvements in exercise capacity and helps reduce some symptoms. The reduction in beneficial effect of SET on exercise function when offered as the second intervention is a new finding that warrants further study."
593,18166880,The French colorectal cancer screening program has planned a stepwise strategy for delivery of a fecal occult blood test kit (Hemocult II) with an initial medical phase followed by systematic mailing of the test. Our aim was to ascertain the cost effectiveness of another recall method.,"In the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne administrative area, we conducted a cost effectiveness study comparing two second line delivery methods: mailing the test kit systematically to all non-responders to the initial medical phase (conventional strategy) and mailing the test kit to non-responders to the initial medical phase who requested a kit after receiving a recall letter (experimental strategy). After randomization, two groups were constituted among a sample of 10 930 persons.",The participation rate was significantly higher in the conventional strategy group than with the experimental strategy group (14.7% vs 8.3%; P&lt;10(-5)). The mean cost of the conventional strategy test was 33.59 euros compared to only 18.50 euros with the experimental strategy (kit mailed only to persons who requested it).,"These findings suggest that mailing a recall letter with a test order coupon can lead to substantial economy with a lost of participation of 6.4% at the test mailing phase. Better allocation of the spared cost (communication, information) might lead to increased participation, a hypothesis which should be tested further."
594,21226782,"The study evaluated the effects of a pros enhancing intervention on intention to uptake cervical cancer screening. It was hypothesized that the pros enhancement session (compared to an education session) would affect intentions of preintentional women, whereas it was expected to have negligible effects among women in intentional and actional stages of the health action process approach (HAPA). Thus, we tested the HAPA using stage-matched and stage-mismatched interventions. Further, a change in decisional balance was assumed to mediate the relationship between the group assignment and intention, with age acting as the moderator.","Respondents (1,436 women, aged 18-60) were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control condition and filled out questionnaires before and directly after the manipulation (in one web-based session).","Direct effects of the group assignment were observed only among preintentional women. Across the stages, however, change in decisional balance mediated the effects of the group assignment on the intention to uptake screening. Further, among participants in the preintentional stage, this mediation became significant only for women aged 35 or older.","Although direct effects are in line with stage assumptions of the HAPA, meditational analysis among pre- and post-intentional women indicated that similar processes accounted for post-manipulation intention. Future research testing stage models should account for the mediating processes, which explain the effects of the intervention."
595,11789186,To explore the effect of Chinese drug Chang'ai Kangfu decoction (CAKF) on immunity in post-operational patients with large intestine cancer (LIC).,"Forty-eight patients with LIC in Dukes' B, C stage after operation were randomly assigned to 3 groups, the CAKF group (16 cases), chemotherapy group (17 cases) and combination therapy (CAKF plus chemotherapy) group (15 cases). 5-FU and mitomycin C were given to the chemotherapy group. The dynamic changes of T-lymphocyte subsets, NK cells and immunoglobulins were investigated.","Before operation, the CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ and the activity of NK cells in LIC patients were lower, but CD8+ was higher than that of normal level (P &lt; 0.01), which indicated that cellular immunity in LIC was in immunosuppressive state, they all further reduced 1 week after operation, particularly CD3+ cell counts, but CD3+, CD4+ and the activity of NK cells normalized 1 month after operation in CAKF group, and 2 months were needed to normalize in combination therapy group. Both groups recovered to a certain extent in comparing with before treatment, but the chemotherapy group recovered slower. The similar results appeared in humoral immunity.",CAKF could obviously increase the immunity in LIC patients after operation.
596,12076551,"High dietary intakes of fruit and vegetables are associated with reduced risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Short-term intensive dietary interventions in selected populations increase fruit and vegetable intake, raise plasma antioxidant concentrations, and lower blood pressure, but long-term effects of interventions in the general population are not certain. We assessed the effect of an intervention to increase fruit and vegetable consumption on plasma concentrations of antioxidant vitamins, daily fruit and vegetable intake, and blood pressure.","We undertook a 6-month, randomised, controlled trial of a brief negotiation method to encourage an increase in consumption of fruit and vegetables to at least five daily portions. We included 690 healthy participants aged 25-64 years recruited from a primary-care health centre.","Plasma concentrations of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, and ascorbic acid increased by more in the intervention group than in controls (significance of between-group differences ranged from p=0.032 to 0.0002). Groups did not differ for changes in lycopene, retinol, alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, or total cholesterol concentrations. Self-reported fruit and vegetable intake increased by a mean 1.4 (SD 1.7) portions in the intervention group and by 0.1 (1.3) portion in the control group (between-group difference=1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6; p&lt;0.0001). Systolic blood pressure fell more in the intervention group than in controls (difference=4.0 mm Hg, 2.0-6.0; p&lt;0.0001), as did diastolic blood pressure (1.5 mm Hg, 0.2-2.7; p=0.02).","The effects of the intervention on fruit and vegetable consumption, plasma antioxidants, and blood pressure would be expected to reduce cardiovascular disease in the general population."
597,12114037,"It has been suggested that increased intake of various antioxidant vitamins reduces the incidence rates of vascular disease, cancer, and other adverse outcomes.","20,536 UK adults (aged 40-80) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive antioxidant vitamin supplementation (600 mg vitamin E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg beta-carotene daily) or matching placebo. Intention-to-treat comparisons of outcome were conducted between all vitamin-allocated and all placebo-allocated participants. An average of 83% of participants in each treatment group remained compliant during the scheduled 5-year treatment period. Allocation to this vitamin regimen approximately doubled the plasma concentration of alpha-tocopherol, increased that of vitamin C by one-third, and quadrupled that of beta-carotene. Primary outcomes were major coronary events (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity.","There were no significant differences in all-cause mortality (1446 [14.1%] vitamin-allocated vs 1389 [13.5%] placebo-allocated), or in deaths due to vascular (878 [8.6%] vs 840 [8.2%]) or non-vascular (568 [5.5%] vs 549 [5.3%]) causes. Nor were there any significant differences in the numbers of participants having non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (1063 [10.4%] vs 1047 [10.2%]), non-fatal or fatal stroke (511 [5.0%] vs 518 [5.0%]), or coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (1058 [10.3%] vs 1086 [10.6%]). For the first occurrence of any of these &quot;major vascular events&quot;, there were no material differences either overall (2306 [22.5%] vs 2312 [22.5%]; event rate ratio 1.00 [95% CI 0.94-1.06]) or in any of the various subcategories considered. There were no significant effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause.","Among the high-risk individuals that were studied, these antioxidant vitamins appeared to be safe. But, although this regimen increased blood vitamin concentrations substantially, it did not produce any significant reductions in the 5-year mortality from, or incidence of, any type of vascular disease, cancer, or other major outcome."
598,29350481,Children with cancer routinely undergo painful medical procedures invoking strong physiological stress responses. Resilience to this pain may be conferred through resources such as emotion regulation strategies and positive affect.,"This study measured dispositional positive affect in children with cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a073) and randomly assigned participants to one of three emotion regulation strategy conditions (distraction, reappraisal, or reassurance). Children applied their assigned strategy during an experimental pain procedure (the cold pressor task [CPT]) and provided saliva samples before, immediately after, and 15 min after the CPT. Saliva samples were later assayed for salivary alpha amylase (sAA)-a surrogate marker for autonomic/sympathetic nervous system activity and regulation.","Children in the reassurance group had sAA levels that continued to rise after completion of the CPT compared to children in the distraction (b\u00a0=\u00a0-1.68, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and reappraisal conditions (b\u00a0=\u00a0-1.24, P\u00a0=\u00a00.084). Furthermore, dispositional positive affect moderated the effect of condition such that children in the reassurance group with lower levels of positive affect had sAA levels that continued to rise after completion of the CPT (dy/dx\u00a0=\u00a01.56, P\u00a0=\u00a00.027), whereas children in the reassurance condition with higher levels of positive affect did not exhibit this rise (P\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05).","Specific emotion regulation strategies, such as distraction and reappraisal, may attenuate the stress response to pain in pediatric patients with cancer, and positive affect may confer resilience in response to pain even with use of less effective coping strategies such as reassurance."
599,16880021,The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cognitive-behavior (CB) group intervention on the psychological distress and adjustment of relatives of cancer patients with a primary disease.,"A total of 52 relatives of cancer patients participated in a CB group intervention, whereas another 52 served as control subjects. All participants completed preintervention and postintervention measures and a 4-month follow-up questionnaire consisting of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), the Psychological Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS), the Mini Sleep Questionnaire, and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support; participants in the group intervention also reported compliance with home practice.","Participants in the intervention group scored significantly lower than the control subjects on the BSI and the PAIS, recorded fewer sleep difficulties in the postintervention and follow-up measures, and reported higher perceived support in the follow-up measure. By contrast, no significant change was observed in the control group during the study period. On the reliable change index, 30.8% of the intervention participants but only 3.9% of the control subjects had statistically significant improvements in their psychological distress. Improvement in the intervention group was associated with higher compliance with home practice.","This study provides evidence for the positive effect of a CB group intervention for family members, which lasted for 4 months after the intervention ended."
600,25749598,"In this randomized trial, Project CARE, we examined whether participation in a cognitive-behavioral stress management and breast cancer wellness and education program improved psychological outcomes among a sample of underserved black breast cancer survivors.","Both complementary medicine interventions were 10-sessions, manualized, group-based, and were culturally adapted for black women in the community from evidence-based interventions. Participants were 114 black women (mean age = 51.1, 27-77 years) who had completed breast cancer treatment 0-12 months before enrollment (stages 0-IV, mean time since cancer diagnosis = 14.1 months). Women were enrolled upon completion of curative treatment (ie, surgical, chemotherapy, radiation oncology) and randomized to receive cognitive-behavioral stress management or cancer wellness and education program.","There was a remarkable 95% retention rate from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Participants in both conditions showed statistically significant improvement on indices of psychological well-being, including overall quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), intrusive thoughts (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression), and stress levels (Perceived Stress Scale) over the 6-month postintervention follow-up (all repeated measures analysis of variance within-subjects time effects: P &lt; .05, except for overall mood; Profile of Mood States-Short Version). Contrary to hypotheses, however, condition \u00d7 time effects were not statistically significant.","Findings suggest that improvements in multiple measures over time may have been due to intensive training in stress management, extensive provision of breast cancer information, or participation in an ongoing supportive group of individuals from a similar racial background. Implications bear on decisions about appropriate control groups, the timing of intervention delivery during the treatment trajectory, and perceived support from the research team."
601,17179478,"Preclinical and observational studies suggest a relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer, but the association remains controversial. We carried out a randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial to test the effect of a dietary intervention designed to reduce fat intake in women with resected, early-stage breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management.","A total of 2437 women were randomly assigned between February 1994 and January 2001 in a ratio of 40:60 to dietary intervention (n = 975) or control (n = 1462) groups. An interim analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 60 months when funding for the intervention ceased. Mean differences between dietary intervention and control groups in nutrient intakes and anthropometric variables were compared with t tests. Relapse-free survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, stratified log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical tests were two-sided.","Dietary fat intake was lower in the intervention than in the control group (fat grams/day at 12 months, 33.3 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 32.2 to 34.5] versus 51.3 [95% CI = 50.0 to 52.7], respectively; P&lt;.001), corresponding to a statistically significant (P = .005), 6-pound lower mean body weight in the intervention group. A total of 277 relapse events (local, regional, distant, or ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence or new contralateral breast cancer) have been reported in 96 of 975 (9.8%) women in the dietary group and 181 of 1462 (12.4%) women in the control group. The hazard ratio of relapse events in the intervention group compared with the control group was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 to 0.98, P = .077 for stratified log rank and P = .034 for adjusted Cox model analysis). Exploratory analyses suggested a differential effect of the dietary intervention based on hormonal receptor status.","A lifestyle intervention reducing dietary fat intake, with modest influence on body weight, may improve relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients receiving conventional cancer management. Longer, ongoing nonintervention follow-up will address original protocol design plans, which called for 3 years of follow-up after completion of recruitment."
602,27015381,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of lumbopelvic exercise in improving health-related fitness, anthropometric measurements, and body composition in colon cancer survivors (CCS).","Forty-six CCS (35% female, n = 14) were assigned to two groups for this randomized controlled clinical trial: a trunk muscle stabilization exercise program group (CO-CUIDATE) and a usual-care group. The CO-CUIDATE program was conducted for 8 wk (three times per week). The primary end point was isometric abdominal strength measured using the trunk curl test. The secondary end points used were isometric back strength, functional capacity, lower-body flexibility, weight, and anthropometric measurements evaluated at baseline, after the physical exercise program and after 6 months of follow-up. A trained member of the research group with 5 yr of experience working with cancer patients and who was blinded to the patient group assessed the variables. All physical tests were conducted with multiple observations.","The adherence to intervention was 88.36%, and two dropouts (10.5%) were recorded. Minor side effects, including discomfort with the exercises in the first sessions, were reported by the participants. ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in group-time interactions for isometric abdominal strength (F = 7.7; P = 0.001), functional capacity (F = 4.6; P = 0.015), lower-body flexibility (right, F = 4.3, P = 0.021 and left, F = 3.6, P = 0.034), and waist circumference (F = 5.7; P = 0.07), which were the best values for the CO-CUIDATE group. No significant changes in isometric back strength, weight, hip circumference or body composition were observed.",An 8-wk program based on stabilization exercises is a promising strategy to increase health-related fitness and to reduce waist circumference in CCS. An exercise program based on lumbopelvic exercise is a feasible intervention to improve the control of deep abdominal muscles and health-related fitness.
603,10564629,"Mammography is the primary method used for breast cancer screening. However, compliance with recommended screening practices is still below acceptable levels. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of five combinations of physician recommendation and telephone or in-person individualized counseling strategies for increasing compliance with mammography.",There were 808 participants who were randomly assigned to one of six groups. A logistic regression model with compliance as the dependent variable and group as the independent variable was used to test for significant differences and a ratio of cost to improvement in mammogram compliance evaluated the cost-effectiveness.,"Three of the interventions (in-person, telephone plus letter, and in-person plus letter) had significantly better compliance rates compared with the control, physician letter, or telephone alone. However, when considering costs, only one emerged as the superior strategy. The cost-effectiveness ratios for the five interventions show that telephone-plus-letter is the most cost-effective strategy, achieving a 35.6% mammography compliance at a marginal cost of $0.78 per 1% increase in women screened.",A tailored phone prompt and physician reminder is an effective and economical intervention to increase mammography. Future research should confirm this finding and address its applicability to practice.
604,15470624,To investigate whether informing patients about mammographic compression changed the anxiety and pain that they experience during mammography.,"Five hundred and one patients were enrolled in the study. Two hundred and fifty seven (51.3%) were informed before the procedure by written forms explaining the necessity of compression. The remaining 244 (48.7%) didn't get any pre-procedural information. All participants completed demographic form and Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory while they were waiting for mammography. They marked the level of pain due to compression on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) after the procedure. Chi square, Pearson's correlation and Student's t tests were used for statistical analyses.","We didn't find any significant difference between the anxiety scores of the informed (41.4+/-7.9) and uninformed (40.9+/-7.7) women, but the pain level was significantly lower in the informed group (16.5+/-22.4) than in the uninformed group (24.5+/-28.1). There was no statistically significant relationship between the anxiety and pain levels. Women who had recently felt tense and nervous or had a fear of breast cancer diagnosis had higher anxiety levels.","Our data shows that informing patients about examination decreases the level of pain due to mammographic compression, but does not alter the anxiety level. The main cause of anxiety appears to be the fear of a malignant diagnosis. Any intervention to decrease this fear may increase the compliance rates for screening mammography."
605,16622537,The objective of this study was to evaluate the association among physiotherapy exercises performed--directed or free--in case of post-operative complications in women who underwent radical mastectomy or quadrantectomy with axillary dissection.,"Sixty women were randomized. The directed group performed physiotherapy following a regimen of 19 exercises. The free group performed the exercises following the biomechanical physiological movements of the shoulder without a previously defined sequence or number of repetitions, exercises were done to the rhythm of music.","In the average, the directed group remained 12.17 + 2.96 days with the drain, while the free group remained 11.96 + 2.32 days, with no significant difference between groups. The amount of secretion drained during the permanence of the drain also revealed resemblance between groups, with an average of 1308.71 + 562.6 ml in the directed group and of 1391.62 + 644.65 ml in the group of free exercises. Incidences of seroma and dehiscence of the surgical wound did not seem to be influenced by the type of exercise at any of the times evaluated. In the directed group, 7.4% and 3.4% of the women presented with seroma on the 28th and 42nd days, respectively, while at the same moments of evaluation the free group presented respectively. 3.6% and 3.6%. Incidence of dehiscence of the surgical wound also was similar in the two groups, in the directed group it was of 20% on the 14th day, 31% on the 28th day and 10.3% on the 42nd day of postoperative. In the free group the incidence was of 23.3% on the 14th day, of 33.3% on the 28th day and of 22.2% on the 42nd day of postoperative. The statistical difference observed in the averages of the hand and arm circumferences does not translate into clinical differences.",The complications were not influenced f by the physiotherapy exercises performed.
606,19338149,To observe the effect of Shugan Liangxue Compound (SLC) for relieving hot flashes in breast cancer patients medicated with tamoxifen.,"A randomized, double blind clinical trial for observing the therapeutic effects of SLC was carried out on 73 breast cancer patients hospitalized from October 2004 to November 2006, who were treated with tamoxifen, and revealed hot flashes. They were randomly assigned to two groups, the 37 in the treated group treated by SLC, and the 36 in the control group treated with placebo. Taking the improvement of hot flashes as an end point index and that of sleep as a secondary index, the effects of treatment were compared by Kupperman scoring with the average times of hot flashes per day and condition of sleep within 1 week before treatment as baseline.","The effects on 66 patients (33 in the treated group and 33 in the control group) were evaluable. In the treated group hot flashes disappeared in 5 patients (15.2%), relieved in 14 (42.4%) and unchanged in 14 (42.4%); while in the control group, it disappeared in none, relieved in 10 (30.3%) and unchanged in 23 (69.7%), comparison between groups showed significant difference (P = 0.012). As for the condition of sleep, it was improved in 21 (63.6%) and unchanged in 12 (36.4%) in the treated group; while the condition of sleep in the control group was improved in 13 (39.4%) and unchanged in 20 (60.6%), also with significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.002).",SLC is effective in alleviating tamoxifen-induced hot flashes and improving the condition of sleep.
607,21866652,To assess the therapeutic efficacy of treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the aged by Chinese medicine (CM) adopting the international questionnaire of quality of life (QOL).,"91 aged patients with advanced NSCLC were randomly assigned to three groups. There were 31 in the CM group (Group I), 30 in the chemotherapy group (Group II), and 30 in the CM and chemotherapy combination group (Group III). Oral administration of CM decoction and intravenous dripping of Chinese patent medicine was given to those in Group I. Patients in Group II received chemotherapeutic protocol alone. Patients in Group III received chemotherapeutic protocol while orally taking CM decoction. Twenty-eight days were taken as one therapeutic course, and two courses in total. Assessment was performed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Lung Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire LC-43 (EORTC QLQ-LC43) before treatment, the 10th day of the second therapeutic course, and the 28th day of the second therapeutic course, respectively.","After two therapeutic courses of treatment, compared with Group II, better effects were obtained in Group I and Group III in the aspects of the physical function, roles function, emotional functions, social functions, general health state, and short breath, cough, fatigue, insomnia, poor appetite, and constipation (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01).",CM therapy could relieve the clinical symptoms of aged patients with advanced NSCLC and improve their QOL.
608,12577351,To explore the effect of ginsenoside in inducing rectal cancer cell apoptosis.,"Fifty patients of rectal cancer diagnosed by pathological examination were randomly divided into two groups, 35 in the treated group and 15 in the control group. The treated group received retention enema with 84.5% ginsenoside for 4-6 hrs every day, 6-8 days consecutively before surgical operation. The control group also received retention enema in the same way but with normal saline instead of ginsenoside. Fresh sample was taken during the operation and examined by electron microscopy.","Symptoms, such as frequent defecation, hematochezia and tenesmus, were palliated in most patients (25/35) and abdominal pain relieved in all the 7 cases of incomplete intestinal obstruction in the treated group. Electron microscopic examination showed that cell apoptosis was observed in cancer sample of 23 cases among the 35 cases of the treated group, amounting to 65.7%. While in the control group, above-mentioned changes were not observed at all.",Ginsenoside has the effect of inducing apoptosis in rectal cancer patients.
609,17990465,To evaluate the therapeutic and adverse reactions of integrative Chinese and Western medicine (ICWM) for treatment of advanced gastric carcinoma.,"Sixty-six patients with advanced gastric carcinoma were randomized into two groups. Patients in the treatment group (34 patients) received chemotherapy of DCF (docetaxel/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil) regimen combined with Chinese herbal medicine, and patients in the control group (32 patients) were treated with chemotherapy of the same regimen alone.","No significant difference between the two groups was found in response rate (55.9% versus 50.0%), clinical benefiting rate (85.3% versus 81.3%) and half year survival rate (82.4% versus 65.6%); but the 1-year survival rate in the treatment group was superior to that in the control group (52.9% versus 25.0% , P &lt; 0.05). As for the adverse reactions, significant difference between the two groups was shown in incidence of leucopenia, nausea and vomiting, mucosa reaction and fatigue, these reactions occurred lesser in the treatment group (P&lt; 0.05).","Although treatment of ICWM for advanced gastric carcinoma cannot improve response rate, it could alleviate the adverse reactions of the treatment, improve quality of life and prolong the survival rate in patients."
610,9625397,"The Mediterranean dietary pattern is thought to reduce the risk of cancer in addition to being cardioprotective. However, no trial has been conducted so far to prove this belief.",We compared overall survival and newly diagnosed cancer rate among 605 patients with coronary heart disease randomized in the Lyon Diet Heart Study and following either a cardioprotective Mediterranean-type diet or a control diet close to the step 1 American Heart Association prudent diet.,"During a follow-up of 4 years, there were a total of 38 deaths (24 in controls vs 14 in the experimental group), including 25 cardiac deaths (19 vs 6) and 7 cancer deaths (4 vs 3), and 24 cancers (17 vs 7). Exclusion of early cancer diagnoses (within the first 24 months after entry into the trial) left a total of 14 cancers (12 vs 2). After adjustment for age, sex, smoking, leukocyte count, cholesterol level, and aspirin use, the reduction of risk in experimental subjects compared with control subjects was 56% (P=.03) for total deaths, 61% (P=.05) for cancers, and 56% (P=.01) for the combination of deaths and cancers. The intakes of fruits, vegetables, and cereals were significantly higher in experimental subjects, providing larger amounts of fiber and vitamin C (P&lt;.05). The intakes of cholesterol and saturated and polyunsaturated fats were lower and those of oleic acid and omega-3 fatty acids were higher (P&lt;.001) in experimental subjects. Plasma levels of vitamins C and E (P&lt;.05) and omega-3 fatty acids (P&lt;.001), measured 2 months after randomization, were higher and those of omega-6 fatty acids were lower (P&lt;.001) in experimental subjects.",This randomized trial suggests that patients following a cardioprotective Mediterranean diet have a prolonged survival and may also be protected against cancer. Further studies are warranted to confirm the data and to explore the role of the different lipids and fatty acids in this protection.
611,22088795,"Chronic threat and anxiety are associated with pro-inflammatory transcriptional profiles in circulating leukocytes, but the causal direction of that relationship has not been established. This study tested whether a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention targeting negative affect and cognition might counteract anxiety-related transcriptional alterations in people confronting a major medical threat.","One hundred ninety-nine women undergoing primary treatment of stage 0-III breast cancer were randomized to a 10-week CBSM protocol or an active control condition. Seventy-nine provided peripheral blood leukocyte samples for genome-wide transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic analyses at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups.","Baseline negative affect was associated with &gt;50% differential expression of 201 leukocyte transcripts, including upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory and metastasis-related genes. CBSM altered leukocyte expression of 91 genes by &gt;50% at follow-up (group \u00d7 time interaction), including downregulation of pro-inflammatory and metastasis-related genes and upregulation of type I interferon response genes. Promoter-based bioinformatic analyses implicated decreased activity of NF-\u03baB/Rel and GATA family transcription factors and increased activity of interferon response factors and the glucocorticoid receptor as potential mediators of CBSM-induced transcriptional alterations.","In early-stage breast cancer patients, a 10-week CBSM intervention can reverse anxiety-related upregulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in circulating leukocytes. These findings clarify the molecular signaling pathways by which behavioral interventions can influence physical health and alter peripheral inflammatory processes that may reciprocally affect brain affective and cognitive processes."
612,9808824,"African Americans have traditionally made little use of the Cancer Information Service (CIS), an information and education program of the National Cancer Institute, for smoking cessation assistance. This study evaluated whether a targeted communications campaign utilizing strategically placed radio and television advertisements in combination with community outreach could lead more adult African American smokers to call the CIS for smoking cessation information and materials.","Fourteen communities, served by four CIS regional offices, were carefully matched on demographic variables and then randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. Six radio advertisements targeting African American smokers to call the CIS for help in quitting smoking were developed and pretested for three different black-oriented formats. One television spot also was produced and pretested. The audio portion of the television ad was utilized as a seventh radio spot for the general programming formats. These advertisements were placed on selected radio and television stations reaching predominantly African American adult audiences. Also, copies of a videotape designed to motivate African American smokers to quit and to call the CIS for help in quitting were widely disseminated through community-based organizations in each experimental market. The aim was to increase the number and proportion of quitting-related calls to the CIS from African Americans within experimental communities.","The call volume from African American smokers was significantly higher in the experimental communities than in the control communities (P &lt; 0.008). The call rate from African American men was higher than typically observed. Overall, African Americans in the experimental communities reported radio more often than television as the way they heard about the CIS.","The results suggest that paid targeted advertising, using radio as a primary channel, is an effective method of reaching an underserved population at risk. Future research directions are discussed."
613,19001601,"Although some observational studies have associated higher calcium intake and especially higher vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with lower breast cancer risk, no randomized trial has evaluated these relationships.","Postmenopausal women (N = 36 282) who were enrolled in a Women's Health Initiative clinical trial were randomly assigned to 1000 mg of elemental calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D(3) daily or placebo for a mean of 7.0 years to determine the effects of supplement use on incidence of hip fracture. Mammograms and breast exams were serially conducted. Invasive breast cancer was a secondary outcome. Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were assessed in a nested case-control study of 1067 case patients and 1067 control subjects. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of breast cancer associated with random assignment to calcium with vitamin D(3). Associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels and total vitamin D intake, body mass index (BMI), recreational physical activity, and breast cancer risks were evaluated using logistic regression models. Statistical tests were two-sided.","Invasive breast cancer incidence was similar in the two groups (528 supplement vs 546 placebo; hazard ratio = 0.96; 95% confidence interval = 0.85 to 1.09). In the nested case-control study, no effect of supplement group assignment on breast cancer risk was seen. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were modestly correlated with total vitamin D intake (diet and supplements) (r = 0.19, P &lt; .001) and were higher among women with lower BMI and higher recreational physical activity (both P &lt; .001). Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not associated with breast cancer risk in analyses that were adjusted for BMI and physical activity (P(trend) = .20).","Calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not reduce invasive breast cancer incidence in postmenopausal women. In addition, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not associated with subsequent breast cancer risk. These findings do not support a relationship between total vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels with breast cancer risk."
614,11006062,The North Carolina WISEWOMAN project was initiated to evaluate the feasibility of expanding an existing cancer screening program to include a cardiovascular disease (CVD) screening and intervention program among low-income women.,"Seventeen North Carolina county health departments were designated as minimum intervention (MI), and 14 as enhanced intervention (EI). The EI included three specially constructed counseling sessions spanning 6 months using a structured assessment and intervention program tailored to lower income women.","Of the 2,148 women screened, 40% had elevated total cholesterol (&gt; or = 240 mg/dL), 39% had low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (&lt; 45 mg/dL), and 63% were hypertensive (systolic blood pressure 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; or = 90 mm Hg or on hypertensive medication). The majority of women (86%) had at least one of these three risk factors. Seventy-six percent were either overweight or obese. After 6 months of follow-up in the EI health departments, changes in total cholesterol levels, HDL-C levels, diastolic blood pressure, and BMI were observed (-5.8 mg/dL, -0.9 mg/dL, -1.7 mm Hg, and -0.3 kg/m(2), respectively), but were not significantly different from MI health departments. A dietary score that summarized fat and cholesterol intake improved by 2.1 units in the EI group, compared with essentially no change in the MI group.",Expanding existing cancer screening programs to include CVD intervention was feasible and may be an effective means for promoting healthful dietary practices among low-income women.
615,30473053,Men with metastatic prostate cancer experience high levels of unmet supportive care needs in current healthcare delivery. We set out to determine the effectiveness of a multimodality supportive care (ThriverCare) intervention on the prevalence of unmet supportive care needs for men and their partner/caregivers.,"A prospective parallel group, pilot randomised controlled pilot trial in 4 hospitals in Scotland. 38 participants with radiologically proven metastatic prostate cancer disease and 10 partners/caregivers were recruited into the study. A two arm 1:1 study design compared the usual standard of care (SC) approach to SC plus ThriverCare intervention. The primary outcome was the Supportive Care Needs Survey at 3 months of intervention.","There was no statistical significant difference in the prevalence of unmet supportive care needs between the intervention group and the usual SC group at baseline p\u202f=\u202f0.112, however a statistically significant difference was observed at 3 months, indicating that the prevalence of unmet supportive care needs were less in the intervention group (1.13, SD 2.5) compared to the usual SC (6.17, SD 7.05), p\u202f=\u202f0.002.","ThriverCare appears to improve the supportive care experience of men with metastatic prostate cancer on hormonal treatment and their partner/caregivers. Our results accentuate that no longer one size of care delivery fits all, care must be responsive and adaptable to meet the individual needs of people affected by cancer to thrive."
616,29681015,This case-control study was designed to assess the efficacy of cryotherapy to prevent paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy in women with breast cancer.,"Participants served as their own paired control, with randomization of the cooled glove/sock to either the dominant or the non-dominant hand/foot, worn for 15\u00a0min prior to, during, and 15\u00a0min after completion of the paclitaxel infusion. Outcome measures included the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, the Brief Pain Inventory, and quantitative sensory testing. Data were measured at each of six time points-baseline, post-treatment (approximately 2\u00a0weeks after the last paclitaxel infusion), and at the first, fifth, ninth, and final weekly paclitaxel treatments.","Of 29 randomized participants, 20 (69%) received at least one cryotherapy treatment, and 11 (38%) received all four cryotherapy treatments. Ten (34%) participants could not tolerate the cryotherapy, and six (21%) declined further participation at some point during the trial. Only seven participants (24%) were available for the final post-chemotherapy QST and questionnaires. There were no significant differences in measures of neuropathy or pain between treated and untreated hands or feet.","Strategies to prevent painful peripheral neuropathy are urgently needed. In this current trial, dropout due to discomfort precluded adequate power to fully understand the potential benefits of cryotherapy. Much more research is needed to discover safe and effective preventive strategies that can be easily implemented within busy infusion centers."
617,8327418,Although rates of mammography screening among women in the general population have been increasing they still fall short of national goals. This study evaluated the effects on rates of participation in mammography screening of obtaining risk factor information and providing general or personalized risk information through direct mailed correspondence.,"Women enrollees in a health maintenance organization (N = 2,076), age 50 and above, were randomized to one of the following four groups: (a) no risk factor questionnaire + generic invitation, (b) no risk factor questionnaire + general risk invitation, (c) risk factor questionnaire + general risk invitation, and (d) risk factor questionnaire + personal risk invitation. Computerized visit records were monitored for 12 months following a mailed invitation to assess whether a mammogram had been obtained.","Overall participation was 37.5% and the rate of participation did not differ significantly across groups (P = 0.26). Participation was related to age (P &lt; 0.02), with rates highest for women ages 60-69 years (42.7%) compared with those for women ages 50-59 (35.5%) and those age 70+ (33.7%). Among women with a family history of breast cancer, the personalized risk invitation was associated with significantly higher participation compared with general risk invitation (66.7 versus 42.9%, respectively; P &lt; 0.003).",Women with a family history of breast cancer are more likely to obtain a mammogram if that fact is reinforced as a risk factor. Research on environmental barriers to mammography screening may suggest alternative strategies for increasing participation.

622,27022113,To determine the effectiveness of acupuncture for the management of hot flashes in women with breast cancer.,"We conducted a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture plus enhanced self-care versus enhanced self-care alone. A total of 190 women with breast cancer were randomly assigned. Random assignment was performed with stratification for hormonal therapy; the allocation ratio was 1:1. Both groups received a booklet with information about climacteric syndrome and its management to be followed for at least 12 weeks. In addition, the acupuncture group received 10 traditional acupuncture treatment sessions involving needling of predefined acupoints. The primary outcome was hot flash score at the end of treatment (week 12), calculated as the frequency multiplied by the average severity of hot flashes. The secondary outcomes were climacteric symptoms and quality of life, measured by the Greene Climacteric and Menopause Quality of Life scales. Health outcomes were measured for up to 6 months after treatment. Expectation and satisfaction of treatment effect and safety were also evaluated. We used intention-to-treat analyses.","Of the participants, 105 were randomly assigned to enhanced self-care and 85 to acupuncture plus enhanced self-care. Acupuncture plus enhanced self-care was associated with a significantly lower hot flash score than enhanced self-care at the end of treatment (P &lt; .001) and at 3- and 6-month post-treatment follow-up visits (P = .0028 and .001, respectively). Acupuncture was also associated with fewer climacteric symptoms and higher quality of life in the vasomotor, physical, and psychosocial dimensions (P &lt; .05).",Acupuncture in association with enhanced self-care is an effective integrative intervention for managing hot flashes and improving quality of life in women with breast cancer.

In our study, adding 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol daily for 2\u00a0yr to standard chemotherapy did not show any benefit in OS or PFS."
625,21457893,Changes in the cortisol awakening response (CAR) were studied in women participating in a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program after completion of their medical treatment for breast cancer.,"Thirty-three women completed questionnaires pre- and post-MBSR pertaining to: stress, depressive symptomatology, and medical symptoms. The CAR was assessed on 3 days pre- and 3 days post-MBSR as a biological marker of stress.","A significant effect on the CAR was found, with cortisol levels showing a prolonged increase after awakening at the post-MBSR assessment period. This was accompanied by significant improvements in self-reported stress levels, depressive symptomatology, and medical symptoms. Furthermore, the change\u00a0in medical symptoms was negatively correlated with the area under the curve (AUC) at study onset (r\u00a0=\u00a0-.52, p\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.002); i.e., the greater the AUC of the CAR before MBSR, the greater the reduction in medical symptoms after the program.",These results suggest the potential usefulness of employing the CAR as a biological marker in women with breast cancer participating in an MBSR program.
626,29777379,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an educational video among women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer on knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction with their surgical decision.","A pre-post-test design was used to evaluate knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction levels with decision-making regarding surgery among women with breast cancer. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented to compare outcomes of newly diagnosed breast cancer women who received standard of care that included breast care nurse counseling sessions and written materials to women who received standard of care plus a supplement educational video. Knowledge and anxiety scores were collected at baseline and 2\u00a0weeks post-operatively. Satisfaction with decision (SWD) on the nature of surgery was gathered 2\u00a0weeks after surgery.","Sixty-two subjects were recruited in a Singapore tertiary cancer center with a cohort of 32 women in the non-video group and 30 women in the video group. There was a statistically significant interaction effect of group and time (p\u2009=\u2009.008), wherein knowledge increased for both groups, although the increase was steeper for the video group. Both groups had significantly lower anxiety at post-implementation compared to pre-implementation (p\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). There were no differences in SWD scores in both groups.",Use of an additional video-based education significantly increased breast cancer knowledge levels among women in the educational video group. Nurses and healthcare professionals should focus on identifying individual informational needs based on surgical options to provide personalize care and transfer the necessary knowledge in empowering woman's decision-making process on her nature of breast surgery.
627,22715124,Research has shown that self-directed stress management training improves mental well-being in patients undergoing chemotherapy. The present study extends this work by evaluating separate and combined effects of stress management training and home-based exercise.,"Following assessment of mental and physical well-being, depression, anxiety, exercise, and stress reduction activity before chemotherapy started, patients were randomized to stress management training (SM), exercise (EX), combined stress management and exercise (SMEX), or usual care only (UCO). Outcomes were reassessed 6 and 12 weeks after chemotherapy started. Significance testing of group-by-time interactions in 286 patients who completed all assessments was used to evaluate intervention efficacy.","Interaction effects for mental and physical well-being scores were not significant. Depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with decreases in SMEX but not UCO. Anxiety scores yielded a quadratic interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.049), with trends for changes in SMEX but not UCO. Additional analyses yielded quadratic interactions for exercise activity comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.022), with positive changes in SMEX but not UCO, and for stress management activity comparing UCO and SM (p &lt; 0.001) and UCO and SMEX (p = 0.013), with positive changes in SM and SMEX but not UCO.","Only the combined intervention yielded effects on quality of life outcomes, and these were limited to anxiety and depression. These findings are consistent with evidence that only the combined intervention yielded increases in both exercise and stress management activity. Future research should investigate ways to augment this intervention to enhance its benefits."
628,27769783,We aimed to study whether dietary fat composition (n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio (PUFAs) and PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) ratio) is associated with total body fat (TF) and body fat distribution and whether this association was modified by the presence of chronic disease in middle-aged and elderly women in two population-based cohorts in the Netherlands and Australia.,"The study was performed in the Rotterdam Study (RS), a prospective cohort study among subjects aged 55 years and older (N\u00a0=\u00a01182 women) and the Calcium Intake Fracture Outcome Study (CAIFOS), a 5-year randomized controlled trial among women age 70+ (N\u00a0=\u00a0891). At baseline, diet (i.e. PUFAs and SFAs) was measured by validated food frequency questionnaires. TF was assessed using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in both studies and android abdominal fat (AF), gynoid fat (GF) and the android/gynoid ratio (A/G ratio) in the RS but not the CAIFOS. Chronic disease was defined as the presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer.","No association was found between dietary n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio or SFA/PUFAs ratio with TF in both cohorts. In the RS, a high n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio was associated with a higher AF (3rd vs. 2nd tertile (reference): \u03b2: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.24) but not with the A/G ratio. A low SFA/PUFA ratio was associated with a lower AF (1st vs. 2nd tertile (reference): \u03b2: -0.12; 95% CI: -0.22, -0.06) but not with the A/G ratio. Presence of chronic disease was found to be a significant effect modifier in both cohorts with regard to n-3/n-6 PUFAs and TF (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). In participants without chronic disease, a higher n-3/n-6 PUFAs ratio was associated with a higher TF in the RS cohort (3rd vs. 2nd tertile (reference): \u03b2: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.12, 1.76), but this was not replicated in CAIFOS.",These findings do not support the hypothesis that dietary fat composition is consistently associated with TF and body fat distribution in women. Future studies should clarify to what extent these findings may be influenced by the presence of chronic disease.
629,29570378,"Most diagnostic imaging centers ask patients to fast for 4-6 hours before contrast-enhanced CT. Previous studies have shown that prolonged fasting can be harmful. In addition, manufacturers of contrast agents claim that there is no special preparation needed before examination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of preparative fasting on contrast-enhanced CT at a cancer center.","Outpatients (n = 3206) were prospectively evaluated and randomly assigned to two groups: the 1619 patients in group 1 fasted for at least 4 hours before the examination, whereas the 1587 patients in group 2 received a light meal. Adverse symptoms observed before and after contrast agent administration were compared between groups.","Adverse symptoms occurring after IV contrast agent administration were reported by 45 patients (1.5%) in group 1 and 30 patients (0.9%) in group 2. The most common symptoms were nausea (n = 32), weakness (n = 12), and vomiting (n = 5). The frequency of symptoms did not differ statistically significantly between groups (p &gt; 0.05).","In this sample of patients with cancer undergoing contrast-enhanced CT, very few adverse symptoms were reported regardless of preparative fasting. These results support the idea that preparation for contrast-enhanced CT can be simplified, decreasing the discomfort and inconvenience experienced by patients."
630,15150305,"Although colorectal cancer screening by using a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or barium enema x-ray reduces the incidence of and death from colorectal cancer, the rate of colorectal cancer screening in the general population is low. We conducted a randomized trial consisting of direct mailing of FOBT kits to increase colorectal cancer screening among residents of Wright County, Minnesota, a community in which colorectal cancer screening was promoted.","At baseline, we mailed a questionnaire about colorectal cancer screening to a random sample of Wright County residents aged 50 years or older who were randomly selected from the Minnesota State Driver's License and Identification Card database (estimated N = 1451). The sample was randomly allocated into three equal subgroups: one group (control) received only the questionnaire, one group received FOBT kits by direct mail with reminders, and one group received FOBT kits by direct mail without reminders. Study participants were sent a follow-up questionnaire 1 year after baseline. We used the responses to the questionnaires to estimate the 1-year change in self-reported screening rates in each group and the differences in the changes among the groups, along with the associated bootstrap 95% confidence intervals (CIs).","At baseline, the estimated response rate was 86.5%, self-reported adherence to FOBT guidelines was 21.5%, and overall adherence to any colorectal cancer screening test guidelines was 55.8%. The 1-year rate changes in absolute percentage for self-reported adherence to FOBT use were 1.5% (95% CI = -2.9% to 5.9%) for the control group, 16.9% (95% CI = 11.5% to 22.3%) for the direct-mail-FOBT-with-no-reminders group, and 23.2% (95% CI = 17.2% to 29.3%) for the direct-mail-FOBT-with-reminders group. The 1-year rate changes for self-reported adherence to any colorectal cancer screening test were 7.8% (95% CI = 3.2% to 12.0%) for the control group, 13.2% (95% CI = 8.4% to 18.2%) for the direct-mail-FOBT-with-no-reminders group, and 14.1% (95% CI = 9.1% to 19.1%) for the direct-mail-FOBT-with-reminders group.",Direct mailing of FOBT kits combined with follow-up reminders promotes more rapid increases in the use of FOBT and nearly doubles the increase in overall rate of adherence to colorectal cancer screening guidelines in a general population compared with a community-wide screening promotion and awareness campaign.
631,17320666,Tomatoes are rich in lycopene. This study explored the efficacy of a lycopene-rich tomato product in androgen-independent prostate cancer and the reasons patients participated in an &quot;alternative medicine&quot; study.,This Phase II study evaluated 46 patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. All were asymptomatic and had serum prostate-specific antigen elevation despite hormonal manipulation. All patients completed a questionnaire on their motivations for enrolling in an &quot;alternative medicine&quot; study. Patients were prescribed a lycopene-rich tomato supplement at a lycopene dose of 15 mg twice daily.,"One patient manifested a tumor response with a 50% or greater confirmed decline in serum prostate-specific antigen level, yielding a response rate of 2%. Lycopene was well tolerated, but 1 patient died of a cancer-related hemorrhage, and 1 had grade 4 diarrhea. Grade 1 or 2 events included diarrhea in 18, nausea in 12, abdominal distension in 8, flatulence in 2, vomiting in 2, anorexia in 1, and dyspepsia in 1. The reasons for entering the trial are discussed and were overall positive.","Lycopene, as prescribed in our study, did not appear effective for androgen-independent prostate cancer. The patients' reasons for enrolling in this trial were positive and realistic."
632,27811855,"Sleep disturbances and poor rest-activity rhythms, which can reduce the quality of life, are highly prevalent among patients with lung cancer.","This trial investigated the effects of a 12-week exercise intervention including home-based walking exercise training and weekly exercise counseling on 111 lung cancer patients. Participants were randomly allocated to receive the intervention or usual-care. Outcomes included objective sleep (total sleep time, TST; sleep efficiency, SE; sleep onset latency, SOL; and wake after sleep onset, WASO), subjective sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), and rest-activity rhythms (r24 and I&lt;O). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after intervention.","The PSQI (Wald \u03c7=15.16, P=0.001) and TST (Wald \u03c7=7.59, P=0.023) of the patients in the exercise group significantly improved 3 and 6 months after intervention. The moderating effect of I&lt;O on TST was significant (\u03b2 of group \u00d7 I&lt;O=3.70, P=0.032).",The walking program is an effective intervention for improving the subjective and objective sleep quality of lung cancer patients and can be considered an optional component of lung cancer rehabilitation.
633,16626797,"We report on the process evaluation of an efficacious national smoking cessation intervention for adult survivors of childhood cancer. We examine associations between intervention implementation characteristics and study outcomes, as well as participant characteristics related to level of involvement in the intervention.","The study was conducted at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1999-2001. Participants (n = 398) were randomly assigned to receive a proactive telephone-based peer counseling intervention. They received up to 6 counseling calls, individually tailored and survivor-targeted materials, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patches if they were prepared to quit smoking.","Forty-two percent of survivors participated in the maximum number of calls (5-6), and 29% of participants requested and received NRT. Total counseling time was an average of 51 min. Quit status at follow-up was related to intervention dose, and participants who received NRT were significantly more likely to make a 24-h quit attempt. Demographic variables (females, White), higher daily smoking rate, poorer perceived health and moderate perceived risk of smoking were significantly related to greater intervention involvement.","A brief peer-delivered, telephone counseling intervention is an effective way to intervene with adult survivors of childhood cancer who are smoking. Findings from the process evaluation data (call length and number, frequency, and spacing) will inform future telephone counseling cessation programs."
634,29388275,To examine the dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among colon cancer survivors.,"Thirty-nine stage I to III colon cancer survivors were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: usual-care control, 150\u00a0min\u00b7wk of aerobic exercise (low-dose) and 300\u00a0min\u00b7wk of aerobic exercise (high-dose) for 6\u00a0months. HRQoL outcomes included the Short Form (SF)-36 physical and mental component summary, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory, Fatigue Symptom Inventory, and North Central Cancer Treatment Group bowel function questionnaire, assessed at baseline and post intervention. The primary hypothesis was that exercise would improve HRQoL outcomes in a dose-response fashion, such that high-dose aerobic exercise would yield the largest improvements in HRQoL outcomes.","Over 6\u00a0months, the low-dose group completed 141\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0min\u00b7wk of aerobic exercise, and the high-dose group completed 247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0min\u00b7wk of aerobic exercise. Over 6\u00a0months, exercise improved the physical component summary score of the SF-36 (P \u00a0=\u00a00.002), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Colorectal (P \u00a0=\u00a00.025), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (P \u00a0=\u00a00.049), and the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (P \u00a0=\u00a00.045) in a dose-response fashion. Between-group standardized mean difference effects sizes for the above-described findings were small to moderate in magnitude (0.35-0.75). No dose-response effects were observed for the mental component summary score of the SF-36, the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory, or bowel function.","Higher doses of aerobic exercise, up to 300\u00a0min\u00b7wk , improve multiple HRQoL outcomes among stage I to III colon cancer survivors. These findings provide evidence that aerobic exercise may provide multiple health benefits for colon cancer survivors."
635,10983211,This study assessed the effectiveness of telephone counseling in a church-based mammography promotion intervention trial.,Thirty churches were randomized to telephone counseling and control conditions; telephone interview data were used in assessing intervention effects on mammography adherence. Separate analyses were conducted for baseline-adherent participants (maintaining adherence) and baseline-nonadherent participants (conversion to adherence).,Year 1 follow-up data indicated that the telephone counseling intervention maintained mammography adherence among baseline-adherent participants and reduced the nonadherence rate from 23% to 16%.,Partnerships between the public health and faith communities are potentially effective conduits to promote maintenance of widely endorsed health behaviors such as regular cancer screening.
636,17855695,"Cellular proliferation and apoptosis (cell death) are highly regulated in the colon as insufficient apoptosis may lead to polyps and cancer. Physical activity decreases risk of colon cancer in observational studies, but the biological basis is not well defined. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of a 12-month aerobic exercise program on expression of proteins that promote (Bax) or inhibit (Bcl-2) apoptosis in colon crypts.","Two hundred two sedentary participants, 40 to 75 years, were randomly assigned to moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise for 60 min per day, 6 days per week for 12 months, or usual lifestyle. Colon crypt samples were obtained at baseline and 12 months. Bcl-2 and Bax expression was measured by immunohistochemistry.","Bax density at the bottom of crypts increased in male exercisers versus controls (+0.87 versus -0.18; P = 0.05), whereas the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax at the bottom and middle of crypts decreased as aerobic fitness (VO(2)max) increased (P trend = 0.02 and 0.05, respectively). In female exercisers, Bax density in the middle of crypts decreased (-0.36 versus +0.69; P = 0.03) and Bcl-2 to Bax ratio at the top of crypts increased versus controls (+0.46 versus -0.85; P = 0.03). Bax density in the middle of crypts also decreased as minutes per week of exercise increased (P trend = 0.03).",A 12-month exercise intervention resulted in greater expression of proteins that promote apoptosis at the bottom of colon crypts in men and decreased expression of proteins that promote apoptosis at the middle and top of colon crypts in women. The difference in effect by gender and location of observed changes warrants further study.
637,19445434,To assess the efficacy of an intervention designed to increase appropriate use of breast self-examination (BSE).,"Two-armed randomized clinical trial of cancer-control interventions in women that compared a BSE intervention program to a dietary intervention, which served as the control group. The study was conducted at a large health maintenance organization in Portland, Oregon. Participants were 616 female members of the health maintenance organization who were aged 40 to 70 years. The intervention consisted of a 30- to 45-minute individual counseling session that featured BSE instruction, training and practice with silicone models, identification of barriers to BSE, and problem-solving. This intervention was followed by two brief follow-up telephone calls. The study outcome measure was self-reported BSE practice, which included duration, frequency, and specific elements of exam.","The study had a 90% response rate. At the 1-year follow-up, chi2 analyses showed that significantly more individuals in the BSE intervention (59%) reported adequate BSE performance compared with those in the control group (12.2%; p &lt; .001).","This brief intervention was successful in encouraging women to perform adequate BSEs. Although the role of the BSE in patient care remains controversial, these results show that even brief intervention programs can be effective at encouraging self-screening for cancer. This intervention could easily be modified to target other screening practices (e.g., skin or testicular cancer screening) that are associated with reduced cancer morbidity and mortality."
638,18158012,"Several studies have shown that gum chewing may stimulate bowel motility after gastrointestinal surgery. Because urinary diversion typically uses a segment of bowel, it is conceivable that patients undergoing cystectomy and diversion may benefit from gum chewing. This study aimed to determine whether gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period facilitates a return to bowel function in patients undergoing cystectomy and urinary diversion.","A total of 102 patients underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for clinically localized bladder cancer. Each patient followed our institution's perioperative cystectomy care plan. The first cohort of patients underwent surgery between July 2004 and August 2005 and served as a comparison (control) group in which no gum was dispensed. The second cohort underwent surgery during September 2005 to July 2006. These patients were given chewing gum to begin on postoperative day 1. Outcome measures included time to flatus, time to bowel movement, length of hospital stay, and complications.","The time to flatus was shorter in patients who received gum compared with controls (2.4 versus 2.9 days; P &lt;0.001). Also, time to bowel movement was reduced in patients who received gum (3.2 versus 3.9 days; P &lt;0.001). There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay between gum-chewing patients and controls (4.7 versus 5.1 days, respectively; P = 0.067). Gum chewing was well tolerated in all patients.",Gum chewing may speed the recovery of bowel function after cystectomy and diversion. These findings are consistent with outcomes in the colorectal surgery published data that support the use of chewing gum as an easy and inexpensive way to enhance recovery after surgery.
639,26465985,"Epidemiologic and preclinical data suggest that higher intake and serum levels of vitamin D and higher intake of calcium reduce the risk of colorectal neoplasia. To further study the chemopreventive potential of these nutrients, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both for the prevention of colorectal adenomas.","We recruited patients with recently diagnosed adenomas and no known colorectal polyps remaining after complete colonoscopy. We randomly assigned 2259 participants to receive daily vitamin D3 (1000 IU), calcium as carbonate (1200 mg), both, or neither in a partial 2\u00d72 factorial design. Women could elect to receive calcium plus random assignment to vitamin D or placebo. Follow-up colonoscopy was anticipated to be performed 3 or 5 years after the baseline examinations, according to the endoscopist's recommendation. The primary end point was adenomas diagnosed in the interval from randomization through the anticipated surveillance colonoscopy.","Participants who were randomly assigned to receive vitamin D had a mean net increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 7.83 ng per milliliter, relative to participants given placebo. Overall, 43% of participants had one or more adenomas diagnosed during follow-up. The adjusted risk ratios for recurrent adenomas were 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.09) with vitamin D versus no vitamin D, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.06) with calcium versus no calcium, and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.08) with both agents versus neither agent. The findings for advanced adenomas were similar. There were few serious adverse events.","Daily supplementation with vitamin D3 (1000 IU), calcium (1200 mg), or both after removal of colorectal adenomas did not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas over a period of 3 to 5 years. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00153816.)."
640,18342114,Medical corrective make up can be applied to hide the adverse effects of cancer treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerance and the satisfaction of patients needing medical make up to hide the cutaneous side effects induced by chimiotherapy and to improve self-esteem.,"90 cancer patients were included in this multicentric study. They were being treated by chimiotherapy and had eyebrow alopecia, complexion changes, irregular lip contour or lip dryness. They were made up by socio-esthecians. Photos were taken before and after applications of make up. The patients had to fill in a self-questionnaire at home. The duration of the study varied from 1 to 4 weeks.","Included patients were 52 years old. Tolerance was considered to be satisfactory or very satisfactory by 95,4% and 98,9% of the patients for eyebrow pencil corrector and the dual lip and contour corrector, respectively. Questions on quality of live and self-esteem revealed that the medical corrective make up improved the quality of life in general for 81,2% of the patients. This product range enhanced the self-esteem of 76,8% of the patients. Cosmetic agreement was highly satisfactory.","In this study in which patients were suffering from cancer and treated by chimiotherapy, we showed that medical corrective make up can improve the quality of life with a very good tolerance."
641,29034740,"Sleep disturbance is the second most bothersome symptom in patients with cancer, and it can significantly impair their quality of life. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the traditional herbal medicine Gamiguibi-tang (GGBT) in patients with cancer-related sleep disturbance.","We conducted a prospective, randomized, wait-list-controlled, open-label pilot clinical trial on cancer-related sleep disturbance. Patients with cancer experiencing poor sleep quality with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index of at least 6 were randomly assigned to the GGBT and wait-list groups to receive GGBT and conventional care, respectively, for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. Fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment were assessed as the secondary endpoints by using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).","Thirty participants who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled. Sleep disturbance assessed using the ISI improved significantly more in the GGBT group than in the wait-list group (-5.5 \u00b1 4.4 vs 0.1 \u00b1 1.1, P &lt; .001). Fatigue level determined using the BFI also improved significantly more in the GGBT group than in the wait-list group (-0.8 \u00b1 0.8 vs 0.0 \u00b1 0.3, P = .002). The BDI and MoCA scores showed no significant changes. Adverse events were reported in two patients in the GGBT group and consisted of mild dyspepsia and mild edema.",GGBT may be a potential treatment option for cancer-related sleep disturbance. Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of GGBT.
642,16988932,"Although it is widely recognised that educational interventions may be more effective for people with an 'internal' Locus of Control (who believe that life outcomes are controlled by their own characteristics or actions) compared to people with an 'external' Locus of Control (who believe that life outcomes are controlled by external forces such as luck, fate or others), no study has yet assessed the influence of physicians' Locus of Control (LOC) on communication skills learning. This study aims to test the hypothesis that, in a communication skills training program, physicians with an 'internal' LOC would demonstrate communication skills acquisition to a greater degree than those with an 'external' LOC.","A non-randomised longitudinal intervention study was conducted between January 1999 and April 2001. Sixty-seven volunteer physicians from private and institutional practice in Belgium participated in a learner-centred, skills-focused, practice-oriented communication skills training program. Communication skills changes were assessed in 2 standardised simulated interviews before and after training (one two-person and one three-person interview). Communication skills were assessed using the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop Evaluation Manual. Physicians' LOC was assessed using the Rotter I-E scale. Communication skills changes of the upper and lower third of physicians in respect of their scores on this scale were compared using group by time repeated measures of variance.","In the two-person and three-person interviews, changes in the use of open directive questions were more important among physicians with an &quot;internal&quot; LOC compared with changes observed among physicians with an 'external' LOC (P=0.066 and P=0.004, respectively). In the three-person interview, changes in the use of directive questions, assessing functions and moderate feelings stated explicitly were more important among physicians with an 'internal' LOC compared with changes observed among physicians with an 'external' LOC (P= 0.001; P=0.002 and P=0.011 respectively).",This study shows that physicians' LOC is a psychological characteristic that could influence the efficacy of a communication skills training program. This evidence supports the idea that a psychological characteristic such as 'internal' LOC may facilitate communication skills acquisition through physicians' belief that communication with patients may be controlled by physicians themselves.
643,29086523,This study examined the effects of a group phone-based weight management intervention on change in physical activity as measured via accelerometer and self-report in rural breast cancer survivors. The study also evaluated the role of physical activity on clinically meaningful cut points for weight loss (baseline to 6 months) and weight loss maintenance (6 to 18 months).,Participants were breast cancer survivors in a weight management intervention who provided valid weight and accelerometer data (N\u2009=\u2009142). Participants were categorized into four groups based on weight loss\u2009\u226510% and weight regain\u2009\u22655% at 18 months.,"Accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) significantly increased from baseline to 6 months (+46.9 minutes). MVPA declined during maintenance but remained significantly greater than baseline. Self-reported MVPA followed a similar pattern as accelerometer MVPA, but estimates were significantly higher. Participants in the high loss, low regain group had significantly higher MVPA at all points.",A distance-based weight management intervention for survivors improved physical activity outcomes over 18 months. Self-reported physical activity was substantially higher than accelerometer measured. Findings highlight the importance of device-based measurement for characterizing the magnitude of physical activity change as well as the role of physical activity in weight management outcomes.
644,17932353,There is evidence that non-English speakers in the United States receive lower quality health care and preventive services than English speakers. We tested the hypothesis that Spanish-speaking women would respond differently to an intervention to increase up-to-date status for cancer screening.,"A multisite randomized controlled trial showed that scripted telephone support, provided by a Prevention Care Manager (PCM), increased up-to-date rates for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. This subgroup analysis investigated the relative efficacy of the PCM among women who chose to communicate with the PCM in Spanish versus English.","Of 1,346 women in this analysis, 63% were Spanish speakers. Whereas the PCM intervention increased cancer screening rates generally, Spanish-speaking women seemed to benefit disproportionately more than English-speaking women for cervical cancer screening (unadjusted odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.05). In addition, in this exploratory analysis, there was a trend toward Spanish-speaking women receiving more benefit than English-speaking women from the intervention in increased breast and colorectal cancer screening rates.",Spanish-speaking women seemed to benefit more than did English-speaking women from a bilingual telephone support intervention aimed at increasing cancer screening rates.
645,21290972,"Due to high cancer risks, women carrying a BRCA 1/2 mutation face a complex choice between breast and ovarian cancer surveillance and prophylactic surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate educational-support groups, which are offered to facilitate mutual support between BRCA mutation carriers and to provide adequate information.","Female BRCA mutation carriers were approached by a social worker after genetic test disclosure and offered participation in educational-support groups. Data regarding emotional well-being, breast cancer risk knowledge and perception, cancer risk management behaviour and family communication were collected both before (T1) and after group participation (T2).","Of the 34 participants, mean levels of negative mood states at T1 were significantly higher compared to those of a norm group (depression p &lt; 0.001, anger p &lt; 0.001, fatigue p = 0.04, tension p = 0.03) and remained high at T2. Self-perceived breast cancer risk and frequency of cancer thoughts were high both at T1 and T2. Breast cancer risk knowledge was accurate both at T1 and T2; women either followed current surveillance advices or obtained prophylactic surgery. Communication with the family of origin was significantly reduced at T2 compared to T1 (p = 0.02). At T2, all women indicated that group participation highly met their needs of BRCA-related information to support their decision-making processes regarding cancer surveillance or prophylactic surgery.",After following an educational support group female BRCA mutation carriers were able to make cancer risk management decisions but still reported high levels of emotional distress while family communication appeared diminished.
646,17467230,"Psychological interventions are efficacious in reducing emotional distress for cancer patients. However, it is not clear whether psychological improvements are, in turn, related to improved health. A clinical trial tests whether a psychological intervention for cancer patients can do so, and also tests two routes to achieve better health: (a) reducing patients' Emotional Distress, and/or (b) enhancing their functional immunity.","Post-surgery, 227 breast cancer patients were randomized to intervention or assessment only Study Arms. Conducted in small groups, intervention sessions were offered weekly for 4 months and followed by monthly sessions for 8 months. Measures included psychological (distress), biological (immune), and health outcomes (performance status and evaluations of patient's symptomatology, including toxicity from cancer treatment, lab values) collected at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months.","A path model revealed that intervention participation directly improved health (p&lt;.05) at 12 months. These effects remained when statistically controlling for baseline levels of distress, immunity, and health as well as sociodemographic, disease, and cancer treatment variables. Regarding the mechanisms for achieving better health, support was found for an indirect effect of distress reduction. That is, by specifically lowering intervention patients' distress at 4 months, their health was improved at 12 months (p&lt;.05). Although the intervention simultaneously improved patients' T-cell blastogenesis in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), the latter increases were unrelated to improved health.","A convergence of biobehavioral effects and health improvements were observed. Behavioral change, rather than immunity change, was influential in achieving lower levels of symptomatology and higher functional status. Distress reduction is highlighted as an important mechanism by which health can be improved."
647,25417404,To collect preliminary data on the effects of Saam acupuncture with regard to the immunity in cancer patients.,"Ten cancer patients were analyzed for improvements in immunity. Acupuncture was applied at the 5 acupuncture points, Jingqu (LU 8), Zutonggu (BL 66), Yanggu (SI 5), Yangchi (TE 4), and Zhongwan (CV 12) for 2 weeks with 4 sessions. We assessed the effect of Korean Saam acupuncture on the immune system in cancer patients by measuring particular blood cell subsets, including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD56+ cells, as well as total white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and fatigue score. The measurement was performed before and after acupuncture and at a 2-week follow-up.","There was a statistically significant increase in the number of CD3+ (P = 0.023) and CD8+ cells (P &lt; 0.001) and T-cell subsets, as well as a decrease in the fatigue severity scale (FSS) score (P = 0.001) after Saam acupuncture using the 5 acupoints.","Acupuncture may improve the immune system by increasing the counts of a few immune cells and relieve fatigue in cancer patients by decreasing FSS scores. Although this was a non-controlled study, it constitutes preliminary research investigating the potential effects of Saam acupuncture in increasing the counts of several immune cells in cancer patients."
648,16446335,"The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a structured, multidisciplinary intervention targeted to maintain the overall quality of life (QOL), which is more comprehensive than psychosocial distress, of patients undergoing radiation therapy for advanced-stage cancer.","Radiation therapy patients with advanced cancer and an estimated 5-year survival rate of 0% to 50% were randomly assigned to either an eight-session structured multidisciplinary intervention arm or a standard care arm. The eight 90-minute sessions addressed the five domains of QOL including cognitive, physical, emotional, spiritual, and social functioning. The primary end point of maintaining overall QOL was assessed by a single-item linear analog scale (Linear Analog Scale of Assessment or modified Spitzer Uniscale). QOL was assessed at baseline, week 4 (end of multidisciplinary intervention), week 8, and week 27.","Of the 103 participants, overall QOL at week 4 was maintained by the patients in the intervention (n = 49), whereas QOL at week 4 significantly decreased for patients in the control group (n = 54). This change reflected a 3-point increase from baseline in the intervention group and a 9-point decrease from baseline in the control group (P = .009). Intervention participants maintained their QOL, and controls gradually returned to baseline by the end of the 6-month follow-up period.","Although intervention participants maintained and actually improved their QOL during radiation therapy, control participants experienced a significant decrease in their QOL. Thus, a structured multidisciplinary intervention can help maintain or even improve QOL in patients with advanced cancer who are undergoing cancer treatment."
649,15339409,To evaluate the effects of Fuzheng Yiliu Granule on the expression of CD44v6 and nm23-H1 in esophageal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy.,Sixty-three cases of esophageal carcinoma were randomly divided into two groups: Fuzheng Yiliu Granule plus radiotherapy treated group (n=30) and radiotherapy treated group (n=33). The carcinoma specimens were obtained through endoscopic biopsy before and after twenty-one days of treatment. The expression of CD44v6 and nm23-H1 was determined in the sixty-three specimens of esophageal carcinoma by immunohistochemical SABC methods.,"After twenty-one days of treatment, the positive rates of CD44v6 in the Fuzheng Yiliu Granule plus radiotherapy treated group and the radiotherapy treated group were 40.0% and 69.7%, respectively, and there was significant difference between the two groups (P&lt;0.05). The positive rates of nm23-H1 in the Fuzheng Yiliu Granule plus radiotherapy treated group and the radiotherapy treated group were 20.0% and 21.2%, respectively, and the difference was not significant between the two groups (P&gt;0.05).","Fuzheng Yiliu Granule can lower the expression of CD44v6 in esophageal carcinoma, and may prevent infiltration and lymph node metastasis of esophageal carcinoma."
650,16707149,"The importance of dietary modification for disease prevention is widely accepted. The difficulty of implementing and sustaining long-term changes is also well documented. Nevertheless, a few studies have attempted to achieve significant dietary change for extended periods.","The Hiraka Dietary Intervention Study was a community-based randomized cross-over trial designed to develop an effective dietary modification tool and system in an area with high mortality for stomach cancer and stroke in 1998-2000. The main study subjects were 550 healthy volunteers, who were randomized into two groups and given tailored dietary education aimed at decreasing the intake of sodium and increasing that of carotene and vitamin C in either the first or second year. Four (first intervention group) and three (second intervention group) years after the intervention ended, 308 subjects were selected for this follow-up dietary survey.","The low-sodium, high-vitamin C and -carotene diet was maintained with only a small, nonsignificant reversal from post-intervention to follow-up (P = 0.082-0.824). Significant changes from pre-intervention to follow-up were also maintained (P &lt; 0.01).",This dietary intervention program was maintained well over 4 years after the termination of the intervention sessions.
651,22331983,"To advance knowledge about the cancer-chemopreventive potential of individual nutrients, we investigated the effects of B vitamin and/or \u03c9-3 fatty acid supplements on cancer outcomes among survivors of cardiovascular disease.","This was an ancillary study of the Supplementation With Folate, Vitamins B(6) and B(12) and/or Omega-3 Fatty Acids (SU.FOL.OM3) secondary prevention trial (2003-2009).

652,10924977,"Radiation oncologists are often faced with patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who are not suitable candidates for state-of-the-art radical treatment, but who also are not judged to have a very short life expectancy. Some physicians treat these patients palliatively, whereas others advocate more intensive treatment. To find out if there is a substantial difference in outcome between these approaches, we performed a randomized prospective study.","Between 1994 and 1998, 152 eligible patients with advanced NSCLC Stage III (n = 121) or minimal Stage IV (n = 31) were randomized to receive conventionally fractionated (cf; A: 60 Gy, 6 weeks, n = 79) or short-term treatment (PAIR; B: 32 Gy, 2 Gy b.i.d.; n = 73) of tumor and mediastinum.","One-year survival rate for all patients was 37% with no significant difference between the two treatment arms (A: 36%; B: 38%; p = 0.76). As far as can be judged from limited data available, palliation was adequate and similar for the two treatment arms. Apart from expected differences in the time course of esophagitis, acute side effects were moderate and equally distributed. No severe late effects were observed.","In the present randomized trial, survival and available data on palliation were not different after cf to 60 Gy compared to the palliative PAIR regimen. Therefore, for patients who are not suitable for radical treatment approaches, the prescription of a palliative short-term irradiation appears preferable compared to cf over several weeks."
653,12790313,"Efforts to educate men about the controversy surrounding prostate cancer screening are well intended but rarely evaluated rigorously. We evaluated an evidence-based (EB) booklet for men designed to promote informed decision-making. We also determined whether men's preference for involvement in decision-making (&quot;passive&quot;, &quot;collaborative&quot; or &quot;active&quot;) modified its impact.","Men aged 40-70 years were recruited from the practices of 13 local general practitioners (GPs) in Sydney, Australia. They completed a self-administered questionnaire before seeing their GP, who, according to pre-randomised codes, distributed either our EB booklet or conventional information. Post-test questionnaires were mailed to men three days later. Of the 248 eligible men recruited, 214 (86% response rate) returned post-test questionnaires. Knowledge of evidence and of risk of developing and dying from prostate cancer, attitudes, interest in screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), worry and decisional conflict were the main outcome measures.","Compared with those receiving conventional information, men receiving the EB booklet had significantly improved knowledge (50% of items correct, 95% CI 46-53%; vs 45% correct, 95% CI 42-48%) (p = 0.048) and lower levels of decisional conflict (mean 21.6, 95% CI 20.7-22.5; vs mean 24.3, 95% CI 23.4-25.2) (p &lt; 0.001). Interest in PSA screening was significantly reduced in both groups at post-test (p &lt; 0.001). Men preferring a &quot;passive&quot; approach to decision-making gained as much from our EB booklet as those with &quot;active&quot; or &quot;collaborative&quot; preferences.","Our findings show the benefits of providing evidence-based information to men about PSA screening. Our EB booklet facilitated informed choice, even among &quot;passive&quot; decision-makers."
654,29111172,To evaluate the benefit of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) in addition to nutritional counseling in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT).,"In a single-center, randomized, pragmatic, parallel-group controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02055833; February 2014-August 2016), 159 newly diagnosed HNC patients suitable for to RT regardless of previous surgery and induction chemotherapy were randomly assigned to nutritional counseling in combination with ONS (N\u202f=\u202f78) or without ONS (N\u202f=\u202f81) from the start of RT and continuing for up to 3 months after its end. Primary endpoint was the change in body weight at the end of RT. Secondary endpoints included changes in protein-calorie intake, muscle strength, phase angle and quality of life and anti-cancer treatment tolerance.","In patients with the primary endpoint assessed (modified intention-to-treat population), counseling plus ONS (N\u202f=\u202f67) resulted in smaller loss of body weight than nutritional counseling alone (N\u202f=\u202f69; mean difference, 1.6\u202fkg [95%CI, 0.5-2.7]; P\u202f=\u202f0.006). Imputation of missing outcomes provided consistent findings. In the ONS-supplemented group, higher protein-calorie intake and improvement in quality of life over time were also observed (P\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001 for all). The use of ONS reduced the need for changes in scheduled anti-cancer treatments (i.e. for RT and/or systemic treatment dose reduction or complete suspension, HR=0.40 [95%CI, 0.18-0.91], P\u202f=\u202f0.029).","In HNC patients undergoing RT or RT plus systemic treatment, and receiving nutritional counseling, the use of ONS resulted in better weight maintenance, increased protein-calorie intake, improved quality of life and was associated with better anti-cancer treatment tolerance."

656,16325366,"Aim of the present study was to assess the effect of epirubicin-based chemotherapy on QT interval dispersion in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and the effect of dexrazoxane supplementation. Prolongation of QT dispersion may not only represent a sensitive tool in identifying the first sign of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, but it may serve also in identifying patients who are at risk of arrhythmic events.","Twenty untreated patients, &lt;or=60 years of age with newly-diagnosed aggressive NHL, eligible for a treatment with epirubicin-based chemotherapy were selected for the study. The patients were randomly allocated in two subgroups (N=10) to receive or not dexrazoxane hydrochloride (400 mg/m(2)) after epirubicin infusion. The patients underwent 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) before and after epirubicin infusion and after dexrazoxane supplementation. QT dispersion was defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum QT interval occurring in any of the 12 ECG leads, corrected (QTc) for heart rate.","All the 20 patients showed increased QT dispersion (44.3 +/- 8.4 vs. 68.4+/-11.4 ms, P&lt;0.001) and QTc dispersion (46.2 +/- 6.2 vs. 72.2 +/- 8.4, P&lt;0.001) after chemotherapy infusion. The 10 patients who underwent supplementation with dexrazoxane exhibited a significant reduction of QT dispersion (67.4 +/- 8.1 vs. 49.5 +/- 4.2 ms, P&lt;0.001) and QTc dispersion (71.2 +/- .7 vs. 51.4 +/- 4.3 ms, P&lt;0.001), while the 10 patients not supplemented with dexrazoxane did not (QT dispersion: 69.3 +/- 7.6 vs. 64.2 +/- 6.9 ms; QTc dispersion: 72.8 +/- 8.1 vs. 67.3 +/- 7.2 ms, ns).","Epirubicin-based chemotherapy causes an early increase of the QT and QTc dispersion, which is attenuated by dexrazoxane supplementation.

An effect-of-intervention analysis did reveal lower levels of distress in the CBI group at 2 months, with differences approaching significance at 6 months.","The four-session CBI significantly reduced distress and improved HRQOL for a period of 2 months in patients with melanoma who had medium-to-high distress, with improved general health evident 6 months after the intervention. Some variation in results was revealed in an intent-to-treat analysis. The initial evidence from the current study showed that a brief intervention may be effective for creating change in individuals with cancer who have increased distress, although further research is needed to identify the most optimal approach for delivering the intervention."

This study compared internet and video patient education modalities for men considering the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.,"Two hundred and twenty-six men, aged 50 years or older, and scheduled to complete a physical examination at an HMO Health Appraisal Clinic were randomly assigned to access a website (N = 114) or view a 23-minute videotape in the clinic (N = 112) prior to deciding whether they wanted to be screened for prostate cancer.","There were no between-groups differences in participants' ratings of convenience, effort, or satisfaction following exposure to the decision aid. Participants assigned to the video group were more likely to review the materials than individuals assigned to the internet group (98.2% vs 53.5%). Participants in the video group showed significantly greater increases in PSA knowledge and were more likely to decline the PSA test than individuals assigned to the internet group. However, participants in the internet group who reviewed the entire online presentation showed similar increases in PSA knowledge as video participants. Only 5% of all participants visited other websites to inform themselves about the PSA test.","Overall, the video was significantly more effective than the Internet in educating participants about benefits and risks of PSA screening."

663,10732535,Cancer treatment-related fatigue is a common and disruptive side effect of chemotherapy. Exercise is an intervention proposed to reduce fatigue in cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to describe the patterns of daily fatigue in women with breast cancer who did and did not exercise while receiving the first three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy.,Women received instruction to follow an 8-week home-based exercise program and to maintain daily exercise and fatigue diaries. Functional ability (12-minute walk) was measured pretest and post-test.,"Several distinct patterns of fatigue emerged. The most common pattern of fatigue after chemotherapy demonstrated a sharp rise in fatigue. However, several women demonstrated a chaotic pattern with erratic and wide swings in their fatigue throughout the entire study period. Women who adopted exercise experienced fewer days of high fatigue levels and more days of low levels of fatigue for both average and worst levels of fatigue. Women who did not exercise experienced more bad days (high fatigue) and fewer good days (low fatigue).",Exercise appears to reduce the levels of average and worst fatigue and may help women recognize their pattern of fatigue. Exercise may reduce the intensity of fatigue by reorganizing women's interpretation of fatigue. Routine clinical assessment and education about fatigue by health professionals can help patients to understand their pattern of fatigue and may help them to manage the symptom.

This study examined whether they may prevent the occurrence of upper aerodigestive cancer in subjects heavily exposed to tobacco smoking, such as patients already cured of an early-stage lung cancer.","The adjuvant effect of high-dose vitamin A was tested on 307 patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. After curative surgery, patients were randomly assigned to either a group prescribed retinol palmitate administration (orally 300,000 IU daily for 12 months) or a control group prescribed no treatment.","After a median follow-up of 46 months, the number of patients with either recurrence or new primary tumors was 56 (37%) in the treated arm and 75 (48%) in the control arm. Eighteen patients in the treated group developed a second primary tumor, and 29 patients in the control group developed 33 second primary tumors. A statistically significant difference in favor of treatment was observed concerning time to new primary tumors in the field of prevention (P = .045, log-rank test). The treatment difference in terms of disease-free interval was close to statistical significance (P = .054, log-rank test) and just significant when adjusted for primary tumor classification (P = .038, Cox regression model).",Daily oral administration of high-dose vitamin A is effective in reducing the number of new primary tumors related to tobacco consumption and may improve the disease-free interval in patients curatively resected for stage I lung cancer. The impact of such a treatment on survival needs to be further explored.
665,23647804,"A majority of breast cancer (BC) survivors, particularly those treated with chemotherapy, experience long-term cognitive deficits that significantly reduce quality of life. Among the cognitive domains most commonly affected include executive functions (EF), such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, multitasking, planning, and attention. Previous studies in other populations have shown that cognitive training, a behavioral method for treating cognitive deficits, can result in significant improvements in a number of cognitive skills, including EF.","In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a novel, online EF training program in long-term BC survivors. A total of 41 BC survivors (21 active, 20 wait list) completed the 48 session training program over 12 weeks. The participants were, on average, 6 years after therapy.","Cognitive training led to significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, verbal fluency and processing speed, with marginally significant downstream improvements in verbal memory as assessed via standardized measures. Self-ratings of EF skills, including planning, organizing, and task monitoring, also were improved in the active group compared with the wait list group.","Our findings suggest that EF skills may be improved even in long-term survivors by using a computerized, home-based intervention program. These improvements may potentially include subjective EF skills, which suggest a transfer of the training program to real-world behaviors."
666,15491984,"To evaluate the efficacy of an interactive intervention in reducing distress related to radiation therapy (RT) among pediatric cancer participants as measured by occurrence of sedation, observed behavioral distress (OBD), and heart rate (HR).","Seventy-nine children receiving RT simulation were assigned randomly to a STARBRIGHT Hospital Pals group (i.e., interactive intervention group; IG) or modified control group (MCG). The interactive intervention included filmed modeling, exposure to an interactive Barney character, and passive auditory distraction.",Children in the IG experienced significantly lower HR when compared with MCG participants. No differences were found in terms of sedation or OBD.,The interactive intervention was effective at reducing RT-related distress (as measured by HR) and would be a useful tool in pediatric radiation oncology settings.
667,12113542,"Postoperative ileus limits early hospital discharge for patients who have undergone laparoscopic procedures. Sham feeding has been reported to enhance bowel motility. Here, the effect of gum chewing is evaluated as a convenient method to enhance postoperative recovery from ileus after laparoscopic colectomy.","A total of 19 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer participated in the study. Each patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups: a gum-chewing group (n = 10, mean age 58.6 years, range 50 to 71 years) or a control group (n = 9, mean age 60.6 years, range 45 to 80 years). The patients in the gum-chewing group chewed gum three times a day from the first postoperative AM until oral intake. The times of the first passage of flatus and defecation were recorded precisely.","The first passage of flatus was seen, on average, on postoperative day 2.1 in the gum-chewing group and on day 3.2 in the control group (p &lt; 0.01). The first defecation was 2.7 days sooner in the gum-chewing group (postoperative day 3.1) than in the control group (5.8 days; p&lt; 0.01). All patients tolerated gum chewing on the first operative AM. The postoperative hospital stays for the gum-chewing and control groups were 13.5+/-3.0 days and 14.5+/-6.1 days, respectively.",Gum chewing aids early recovery from postoperative ileus and is an inexpensive and physiologic method for stimulating bowel motility. Gum chewing should be added as an adjunct treatment in postoperative care because it might contribute to shorter hospital stays.

We examined the impact of group psychosocial support on health care costs in metastatic breast cancer. Psychosocial interventions have been shown to reduce psychological distress in these patients. In other diseases, depression and anxiety have been associated with higher health care system resource utilization.",Data on health care system resources utilization were collected as part of a Canadian multicenter randomized controlled trial of a supportive-expressive group support in metastatic breast cancer. Costs were obtained from one tertiary care hospital in Toronto. A cost minimization analysis was conducted since there was no survival difference; the primary endpoint of the study. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted for mood and pain.,"Total health care utilization costs (including costs of the group therapy intervention) for the intervention and control groups were $31,715 and $28,189, respectively per patient. The difference in total costs between groups ($3,526) was not statistically significant (P = 0.53). The cost-effectiveness analysis for mood showed the intervention group to have an increased cost of $5,550 per patient for an effect size of 0.5 on the POMS scale. The corresponding cost for pain was $4,309. An exploratory analysis on patients who were more distressed at baseline showed a non-significant decrease in cost in favor of the intervention arm (difference of $3,911 P = 0.66).","Psychosocial intervention, in the form of supportive-expressive group support for metastatic breast cancer, does not lower health care system resource utilization."
669,25631707,"To evaluate the mode of delivery of a stress management intervention, in a group or individual setting, on self-reported cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms. A secondary aim was to evaluate a stepped care approach.","All study participants (n\u2009=\u2009425), who were female, newly diagnosed with breast cancer and receiving standard oncological care were offered Step I of the stepped care approach, a stress management education (SME). Thereafter, they were screened for cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms, and, if present (n\u2009=\u2009304), were invited to join Step II, a more intense intervention, derived from cognitive behavioral therapy, to which they were randomized to either a group (n\u2009=\u200977) or individual (n\u2009=\u200978) setting. To assess cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms, participants completed the Impact of Event Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at the time of inclusion, three-months post-inclusion and approximately 12-months post-inclusion.","The SME did not significantly decrease any of the cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms. No statistically significant differences were found between the group and the individual setting interventions. However, only 54% of the participants attended the group setting compared to 91% for the individual setting.","The mode of delivery had no effect on the cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms; however, the individual setting was preferred. In future studies, a preference-based RCT design will be recommended for evaluating the different treatment effects."
670,16263208,"Epidemiological studies have shown significant relationships between the use of dietary components and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Large studies of primary prevention, which confirm these findings, are desirable but costly and difficult to design. The present tertiary prevention study reports on the effect of a dietary supplement in comparison with placebo on the rate of increase of prostate-specific antigen (PSA).","49 patients with a history of prostate cancer and rising PSA levels after radical prostatectomy (n = 34) or radiotherapy (n = 15) participated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of a dietary supplement. Ethical approval of the protocol was obtained. Treatment periods of 10 weeks were separated by a 4-week washout period. The supplement consisted of soy, isoflavones, lycopene, silymarin and antioxidants as main ingredients. Changes in the rate of increase of PSA (PSA slope and doubling time) were the primary parameters of efficacy. Analyses according to intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) were carried out.","Baseline parameters did not differ between randomised groups. Five participants were lost to follow-up, however 46 could be evaluated in an ITT analysis. PP analysis could be performed in 42 men with at least 5 PSA measurements. Per protocol analysis showed a significant decrease in PSA slope (p = 0.030) and (2)log PSA slope (p = 0.041). This translates into a 2.6 fold increase in the PSA doubling time from 445 to 1150 days for the supplement and placebo periods. No treatment-based changes in safety parameters were observed during the study.",The soy-based dietary supplement utilised in this study was shown to delay PSA progression after potentially curative treatment in a significant fashion. More extensive studies of the supplement may be indicated.
671,22624409,"Regular physical activity and exercise improves quality of life and possibly reduces risk of disease relapse and prolongs survival in breast cancer survivors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a 3-week moderate intensity aerobic training, on aerobic capacity (VO2max) in breast cancer survivors.","A prospective, randomized clinical study included 18 female breast cancer survivors in stage I-IIIA, in which the primary treatment was accomplished at least 3 months before the study inclusion. In all the patients VO2max was estimated using the Astrand's protocol on a bicycle-ergometer (before and after 3 weeks of training), while subjective assessment of exertion during training were estimated by the Category-Ratio RPE Scale. Each workout lasted 21 minutes: 3 minutes for warm-up and cool-down each and 15 min of full training, 2 times a week. The workload in the group E1 was predefined at the level of 45% to 65% of individual VO2max, and in the group E2 it was based on subjective evaluation of exertion, at the level marked 4-6. Data on the subjective feeling of exertion were collected after each training course in both groups.","We recorded a statistically significant improvement in VO2max in both groups (E1--11.86%; E2--17.72%), with no significant differences between the groups. The workload level, determined by the percent of VO2max, was different between the groups E1 and E2 (50.47 +/- 7.02% vs 55.58 +/- 9.58%), as well as subjective perception of exertion (in the groups E1 and E2, 11.6% and 41.6% of training, respectively, was graded in the mark 6).","In our group of breast cancer survivors, a 3-week moderate intensity aerobic training significantly improved the level of VO2max."
672,28614627,"Cancer cachexia is a syndrome of weight loss (including muscle and fat), anorexia, and decreased physical function. It has been suggested that the optimal treatment for cachexia should be a multimodal intervention. The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and safety of a multimodal intervention (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid nutritional supplements, exercise, and anti-inflammatory medication: celecoxib) for cancer cachexia in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer, undergoing chemotherapy.","Patients receiving two cycles of standard chemotherapy were randomized to either the multimodal cachexia intervention or standard care. Primary outcome measures were feasibility assessed by recruitment, attrition, and compliance with intervention (&gt;50% of components in &gt;50% of patients). Key secondary outcomes were change in weight, muscle mass, physical activity, safety, and survival.","Three hundred and ninety-nine were screened resulting in 46 patients recruited (11.5%). Twenty five patients were randomized to the treatment and 21 as controls. Forty-one completed the study (attrition rate 11%). Compliance to the individual components of the intervention was 76% for celecoxib, 60% for exercise, and 48% for nutritional supplements. As expected from the sample size, there was no statistically significant effect on physical activity or muscle mass. There were no intervention-related Serious Adverse Events and survival was similar between the groups.","A multimodal cachexia intervention is feasible and safe in patients with incurable lung or pancreatic cancer; however, compliance to nutritional supplements was suboptimal. A phase III study is now underway to assess fully the effect of the intervention."
673,25152504,"We examined the efficacy of a community-based, culturally relevant intervention to promote healthy eating and physical activity among African American (AA) women between the ages of 45-65 years, residing in rural Alabama.",We conducted a group randomized controlled trial with counties as the unit of randomization that evaluated two interventions based on health priorities identified by the community: (1) promotion of healthy eating and physical activity; and (2) promotion of breast and cervical cancer screening. A total of 6 counties with 565 participants were enrolled in the study between November 2009 and October 2011.,"The overall retention rate at 24-month follow-up was 54.7%. Higher retention rate was observed in the &quot;healthy lifestyle&quot; arm (63.1%) as compared to the &quot;screening&quot; arm (45.3%). Participants in the &quot;healthy lifestyle&quot; arm showed significant positive changes compared to the &quot;screening&quot; arm at 12-month follow-up with regard to decrease in fried food consumption and an increase in both fruit/vegetable intake and physical activity. At 24-month follow-up, these positive changes were maintained with healthy eating behaviors, but not engagement in physical activity.","A culturally relevant intervention, developed in collaboration with the target audience, can improve (and maintain) healthy eating among AA women living in rural areas."
674,29417836,We aimed to investigate the effects of brief supportive expressive group therapy with mindfulness for cancer patients and to assess the utility of heart rate variability (HRV) as a biomarker of distress and treatment effect.,"A total of 28 female patients with nonmetastatic cancer at a university hospital in South Korea received a 4-week modified group therapy for distress reduction. The BESTMIND (Brief Expression and Support Therapy with Mindfulness) program consisted of supportive-expressive group therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction. The subjective outcomes of distress, anger, sleep quality, and sense of well-being and the physiological outcome of HRV were assessed before and after the program.","After the program, patients showed significantly reduced distress, perceived stress, anger, and sleep disturbance and increased quality of life. No significant change was observed in the degree of mindfulness. A significantly increased SD in the normal beat-to-beat intervals and normalized high-frequency (HF 0.15-0.4 Hz) power from spectral analysis were observed after treatment. According to the correlation analyses, HF power correlated with depression scores, and normalized HF power was associated with depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and anger at baseline. The pretreatment and posttreatment comparison indicated that an increase in HF power was associated with a decrease in anger.","These results suggest the effectiveness of this modified group-based program for distress reduction and also provide preliminary evidence for the use of HRV as a biomarker of distress and recovery. HF power from HRV variables may serve as a quantitative biomarker of the treatment response of distress management, including anger."
675,16481636,"Higher intake of calcium and vitamin D has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer in epidemiologic studies and polyp recurrence in polyp-prevention trials. However, randomized-trial evidence that calcium with vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer is lacking.","We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 36,282 postmenopausal women from 40 Women's Health Initiative centers: 18,176 women received 500 mg of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with 200 IU of vitamin D3 [corrected] twice daily (1000 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D3) and 18,106 received a matching placebo for an average of 7.0 years. The incidence of pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer was the designated secondary outcome. Baseline levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D were assessed in a nested case-control study.","The incidence of invasive colorectal cancer did not differ significantly between women assigned to calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and those assigned to placebo (168 and 154 cases; hazard ratio, 1.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.34; P=0.51), and the tumor characteristics were similar in the two groups. The frequency of colorectal-cancer screening and abdominal symptoms was similar in the two groups. There were no significant treatment interactions with baseline characteristics.","Daily supplementation of calcium with vitamin D for seven years had no effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer among postmenopausal women. The long latency associated with the development of colorectal cancer, along with the seven-year duration of the trial, may have contributed to this null finding. Ongoing follow-up will assess the longer-term effect of this intervention. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000611.)."
676,18314473,"Most health promotion trials in cancer screening offer limited evidence of external validity. We assessed internal and external validity in a nationwide, population-based trial of an intervention to promote regular mammography screening.","Beginning in September 2000, study candidates age 52 years and older (n = 23,000) were randomly selected from the National Registry of Women Veterans and sent an eligibility survey. Consistent with intention-to-treat principles for effectiveness trials, we randomly assigned eligible respondents and nonrespondents to one of five groups. We mailed baseline surveys to groups 1-3 followed by intervention materials of varying personalization to groups 1 and 2. We delayed mailing baseline surveys to two additional control groups to coincide with the mailing of postintervention follow-up surveys to groups 1-3 at year 1 (group 4) and year 2 (group 5). Mammography rates were determined from self-report and Veterans Health Administration records. To assess internal validity, we compared groups on participation and factors associated with mammography screening at each stage. To assess external validity, we compared groups 3, 4, and 5 on mammography rates at the most recent follow-up to detect any cueing effects of prior surveys and at the respective baselines to uncover any secular trends. We also compared nonparticipants with participants on factors associated with mammography screening at the trial's end.","We established study eligibility for 21,340 (92.8%) of the study candidates. Groups 1-3 were similar throughout the trial in participation and correlates of mammography screening. No statistically significant survey cueing effects or differences between nonparticipants and participants across groups were observed. Mammography screening rates over the 30 months preceding the respective baselines were lower in group 5 (82.3% by self-report) than in groups 1-4 (85.1%, P = .024, group 5 vs groups 1-4 combined), suggesting a decline over time similar to that reported for US women in general.",This systematic assessment provides evidence of the trial's internal and external validity and illustrates an approach to evaluating validity that is readily adaptable to future trials of behavioral interventions.
677,23280399,"Considerable efforts have been undertaken in the United States to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality by increasing screening; however, disparities in screening rates continue to exist among certain racial and ethnic minority groups. The objective of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of a lay health worker-delivered intervention-AMIGAS (Ayudando a las Mujeres con Informacion, Guia, y Amor para su Salud [helping women with information, guidance, and love for their health])-to increase Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening among 3 populations of women of Mexican origin.","Six hundred thirteen women of Mexican origin in 3 treatment sites were randomized among 4 study arms: the full AMIGAS program with a video and a flip chart (n = 151), the AMIGAS program without the video (n = 154), the AMIGAS program without the flip chart (n = 155), and a usual care control group (n = 153). Six months after enrollment, women were surveyed and reported whether or not they had been screened.","Women in any of the intervention arms were statistically significantly more likely to report being screened than those in the usual care group in both an intent-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 25% of women in the control group and 52% in the full AMIGAS program group reported having had Pap tests (P &lt; .001); in the per-protocol analysis, the percentages were 29% and 62%, respectively (P &lt; .001).",AMIGAS was effective in increasing Pap test screening among women of Mexican descent when used in a 1-to-1 setting. Future research should compare the 1-on-1 intervention with the group-based intervention.

Beverage consumption was estimated by using three nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls. Incident cancer cases were identified through clinical examinations performed every other year, including, e.g., a screening mammogram, and through a monthly health questionnaire.","During the median 6.6 years of follow-up, 95 breast cancers were diagnosed. In a multivariate model, an inverse association between herbal tea consumption and risk for breast cancer was observed (compared with nondrinkers, drinking 1 to 149 mL/d; relative risk [RR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.80, and for &gt; or =150 mL/d; RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.94; p for trend = 0.04). Consumption of coffee, tea, fruit juices, or wine was not associated with risk for breast cancer.",Results of this study suggest that consumption of herbal tea may have a role in the prevention of breast cancer.
679,29031121,"Decision-making concerning risk-reducing mastectomy for women at hereditary risk of breast cancer entails complex personal choices. Deciding whether and how to restore breast shape after risk-reducing mastectomy is a key part of this process. We developed a web-based decision aid, BRECONDA (Breast Reconstruction Decision Aid), to assist women in decision-making regarding breast reconstruction.","This study assessed the efficacy of BRECONDA to assist women at increased risk of breast cancer in making decisions regarding risk-reducing mastectomy in terms of decisional conflict, knowledge, and satisfaction with information. Women at hereditary risk of breast cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a064) were recruited into this randomized controlled trial from four Australian hereditary cancer clinics. Participants initially provided online consent and completed baseline questionnaires assessing decisional conflict, knowledge, and satisfaction with information. They were then randomly assigned to either: 1) Intervention - unlimited access to BRECONDA, with usual care; or, 2) Control - usual care. At 2-months follow-up (N\u00a0=\u00a060) the outcomes were re-assessed. Intervention participants also completed user acceptability ratings for the intervention overall and specific key modules.","MANCOVA analyses indicated that Intervention participants reported lower decisional conflict (P\u00a0=\u00a00.027), and greater knowledge (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019) and satisfaction with information (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0005) at 2-months follow-up compared with Controls. Intervention participants reported high user acceptability and satisfaction with the intervention.","BRECONDA benefits women considering risk-reducing mastectomy by reducing decisional conflict, and improving knowledge and satisfaction with information. These benefits, coupled with high user acceptability, demonstrate the feasibility of implementing BRECONDA in the hereditary cancer risk context."

The patients in Group 1 underwent a 10-week Hatha yoga exercise program. The patients in Group 2 were included in a 10-week follow-up program. Our primary endpoint was arm and shoulder pain intensity.","The group receiving yoga showed a significant improvement in their pain severity from baseline to post-treatment, and these benefits were maintained at 2.5 months post-treatment. When compared to the control group, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to the parameters assessed at the end of week 10.","Yoga was an effective and safe exercise for alleviating shoulder and arm pain, which is a complication with a high prevalence in patients with breast cancer."
681,26982446,"Text messaging (TMs) on cell phones is emerging as an effective means of delivering behavioral interventions. However, little is known about TM use in adult cancer patients. The present study aimed to extend knowledge on acceptability of a TM intervention in adult cancer patients; examine factors of those screened and enrolled; and compare recruitment at a large national specialty pharmacy versus community-based cancer clinics.","Screening, enrollment, and baseline data collected in two randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of TMs on medication adherence or symptom severity in adults prescribed oral anticancer agents were linked. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, t-tests, and generalized linear modeling were used to examine sociodemographics, cancer type and stage, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, social support, and symptoms.","The cancer clinics screened 293 patients, 43% were eligible, and 56% consented. The specialty pharmacy screened 169 patients, 72% were eligible, and 74% consented. Mean age was 58 years and did not differ by recruitment setting.

The rate and time of relapse and metastasis were observed after 1, 2 and 3 years.","One-year, 2-year and 3-year relapse-metastasis rate was 0, 2.7% and 14.8% respectively in the treated group, and 6.2% , 24.2% and 30.8% in the control group. Significant difference was found only in the 2-year rate between the two groups (chi-squared = 5.428, P &lt; 0.05). Average time of relapse and metastasis was 26.2 +/- 4.5 months in the treated group and 14.2 +/- 4.2 months in the control group, showing significant difference between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05).","FC and QC applying in the succedent consolidating treatment for stage II and III colorectal cancer after radical operation might be favourable to reduce relapse and metastasis and improve quality of life, further clinical study with randomized and controlled method is worthwhile to be conducted."
683,29763431,The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.,"In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient's life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.","The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (p = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48). Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death.",LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity.
684,28707168,Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing symptom that is the most common unpleasant side effect experienced by lung cancer patients and is challenging for clinical care workers to manage.,"We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial to evaluate the clinical effect of acupuncture on CRF in lung cancer patients. Twenty-eight patients presenting with CRF were randomly assigned to active acupuncture or placebo acupuncture groups to receive acupoint stimulation (LI-4, Ren-6, St-36, KI-3, and Sp-6) twice per week for 4\u00a0weeks, followed by 2\u00a0weeks of follow-up. The primary outcome was the change in intensity of CFR based on the Chinese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI-C). As the secondary endpoint, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung Cancer Subscale (FACT-LCS) was adopted to assess the influence of acupuncture on patients' quality of life (QOL). Adverse events and safety of treatments were monitored throughout the trial.","Our pilot study demonstrated feasibility among patients with appropriate inclusion criteria and good compliance with acupuncture treatment. A significant reduction in the BFI-C score was observed at 2\u00a0weeks in the 14 participants who received active acupuncture compared with those receiving the placebo (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01). At week 6, symptoms further improved according to the BFI-C (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) and the FACT-LCS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events in either group (P\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05).","Fatigue is a common symptom experienced by lung cancer patients. Acupuncture may be a safe and feasible optional method for adjunctive treatment in cancer palliative care, and appropriately powered trials are warranted to evaluate the effects of acupuncture."
685,29350459,"Obesity rates in pediatric cancer survivors (PCS) are alarmingly high. Although healthy lifestyle changes may prevent future health complications, promoting healthy behaviors in PCS is challenging, and few interventions have successfully addressed this issue.","This randomized control trial evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a parent-focused six-session intervention, NOURISH-T (Nourishing Our Understanding of Role Modeling to Improve Support and Health for Healthy Transitions), compared with enhanced usual care (EUC) on the outcomes of caregiver and PCS anthropometric measurements, eating behaviors, and physical activity. Behavioral and self-report assessments of caregivers and PCS in both conditions were conducted at baseline, postintervention, and at a 4-month follow-up.","In comparison to no change among EUC caregivers, NOURISH-T caregivers showed small yet significant decreases from baseline through follow-up on BMI, waist-hip ratio, and total daily caloric intake. However, there was no change with regard to daily fat and sugar intake. NOURISH-T caregivers also showed positive changes in their child feeding behaviors, including decreases in pressuring their child to eat and restricting their child's eating and increased eating together as a family. Similarly, decreases in BMI percentile, waist-hip ratio, and sugary beverage consumption were found for NOURISH-T PCS from baseline to postintervention. NOURISH-T PCS also significantly increased their daily steps, whereas EUC PCS decreased their daily steps.","Results suggest that an intervention targeting parents is feasible and demonstrates preliminary effectiveness. NOURISH-T showed a longer term effect on caregivers, and, although shorter term effect, a positive impact on the PCS themselves. Implications for ways to improve NOURISH-T as an intervention for increasing healthy behaviors of PCS are discussed."
686,17513815,"A first breast cancer recurrence creates considerable distress, yet few psychosocial interventions directed at this population have been reported. The Southwest Oncology Group conducted a phase III randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief telephone intervention.","Three hundred five women experiencing a first recurrence of breast cancer were randomly assigned to standard care or intervention. The intervention consisted of four to eight telephone calls delivered over a 1-month period. The calls were conducted by trained peer counselors at a breast cancer advocacy organization, the Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization, and followed a standard curriculum. Psychosocial distress (Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System-Short Form [CARES-SF]) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]) outcomes were assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months. The 3-month assessment was the primary end point and is the focus of this article.","Analysis revealed no differences in distress or depressive symptoms at 3 months between the intervention and control groups; at 3 months, 70% of control patients and 66% of intervention patients reported psychosocial distress, and 40% of control patients and 47% of intervention patients exhibited depressive symptoms.",Telephone peer counseling did not lead to better psychosocial outcomes. The persistent distress in these women supports the urgent need for the development and testing of more intensive or different supportive interventions for this group of patients.
687,15565808,"Hot flashes cause significant morbidity in postmenopausal women, including women with breast cancer. We undertook a pilot study to estimate the effectiveness of black cohosh to reduce hot flashes.","Women who reported significant hot flashes (&gt; or = 14 per week) were enrolled. Black cohosh was given in the form of the commercial product Remifemin. The first week was a no-treatment baseline period, and therapy was given for the subsequent 4 weeks. Hot flash data were collected by daily questionnaires during baseline and treatment weeks. Adverse effects were recorded.","Twenty-one women completed the study. Their mean age was 56 years (range, 38-80). Thirteen patients had a history of breast cancer. Six patients were taking tamoxifen or raloxifene. Patients reported an average of 8.3 hot flashes per day during the baseline week. The reduction in mean daily hot flash frequency was 50% (95% CI, 34%-65%), while weekly hot flash scores were reduced 56% (95% CI, 40%-71%) at completion of the study. Overall, patients reported less trouble with sleeping, less fatigue, and less abnormal sweating. No patients stopped therapy because of adverse effects.",Black cohosh appeared to reduce hot flashes and had a low toxicity. The efficacy found in this trial seems to be more than would be expected by a placebo effect (20%-30% hot flash reduction in previous trials). These results suggest that further evaluation of this black cohosh preparation with a phase III randomized trial is indicated.
688,21712486,"This prospective, controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the mixture of botanical compounds known as LCS101 in preventing chemotherapy-induced hematological toxicity in breast cancer patients.","Female patients diagnosed with localized breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive treatment with either LCS101 or placebo capsules, in addition to conventional chemotherapy. The study intervention was initiated 2 weeks prior to the initiation of chemotherapy and continued until chemotherapy was completed, with participants receiving 2 g of LCS101 capsules thrice daily. Subjects were assessed for the development of hematological and nonhematological toxicities, as well as the tolerability and safety of the study intervention.","Sixty-five breast cancer patients were recruited, with 34 allocated to LCS101 and 31 allocated to placebo treatment. Patients in the treatment group developed significantly less severe (grades 2-4) anemia (p &lt; .01) and leukopenia (p &lt; .03) when comparing grades 0-1 with grades 2-4, with significantly less neutropenia (p &lt; .04) when comparing grades 0-2 with grades 3-4. This effect was more significant among patients undergoing a dose-dense regimen. No statistically significant effect was found with respect to nonhematological toxicities, and side effect rates were not significantly different between the groups, with no severe or life-threatening events observed in either group.","The addition of LCS101 to anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy is safe and well tolerated, and may significantly prevent some chemotherapy-induced hematological toxicities in early breast cancer patients. These results should encourage further larger and more extensive clinical trials."

This study examined whether supervised moderate-intensity exercise could mitigate the complications that occur during radiotherapy.,"Forty women were randomized before radiotherapy after various operations for breast cancer. Seventeen patients who were assigned to the exercise group performed supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy for 50 min 3 times per week for 5 weeks. Twenty-three patients in the control group were asked to perform self-shoulder stretching exercise. The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), brief fatigue inventory (BFI), range of motion (ROM) of the shoulder, and pain score were assessed before and after radiotherapy.","There were no significant differences noted at baseline between groups. In the exercise group, there was an increase in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and decrease in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. On the other hand, patients in the control group showed decrease in the WHOQOL-BREF and shoulder ROM and increase in BFI and pain score after radiotherapy. There were statistically significant differences in the changes in the WHOQOL, BFI, shoulder ROM, and pain score between the groups.",Patients receiving radiotherapy for breast cancer may benefit in physical and psychological aspects from supervised moderate-intensity exercise therapy.
690,25053388,A phase 1 study was conducted to evaluate the bioavailability and food effect of a new veliparib formulation in subjects with solid tumors.,"Subjects (planned: Stage I, N = 20; Stage II, N = 16) received four regimens of a single oral dose of veliparib utilizing a group-sequential design. Subjects were administered single doses of 40 mg veliparib supplied as four 10 mg current formulation, four 10 mg new formulation and one 40 mg new formulation under fasting conditions and under non-fasting conditions. Serial blood samples were collected for the determination of veliparib pharmacokinetics. At the end of Stage I, the relative bioavailability between each pair of regimens was assessed by a two one-sided tests procedure from the analyses of the natural logarithms of C(max) and AUC. A 92.7 % confidence interval within the 0.80-1.25 range between each regimen pair determined bioequivalence.","Four 10 mg current formulation capsules, four 10 mg new formulation and one 40 mg new formulation were bioequivalent with respect to C(max) and AUC under fasting conditions. The administration of a high-fat meal did not have a significant effect on AUC and only caused a slight decrease in veliparib C(max) (17 %) and a delay of approximately 1 h in T(max).",The 40 mg new capsule was bioequivalent to currently used formulation. Food had no effect on the extent of veliparib absorption and only a small (17 %) decrease in peak exposure of veliparib.
691,23759361,"The French setting, including laws and guidelines, advocates greater involvement of informal caregivers in the care of cancer patients to protect the caregivers from depression, distress, and a decrease in their quality of life. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a caregiver educational programme by measuring two outcomes: patients' and caregivers' quality of life and caregivers' burden.","A multicentre randomised controlled trial was performed in six oncology wards in French hospitals. Eligible patients had a cancer, a main caregiver, allowed their caregivers' involvement, and received an inclusion agreement by a doctor/psychologist dyad. The experimental group participated in an educational programme performed by nurses to improve their skills in meal support, nursing care, welfare care, or symptom management. The SF36 and the Zarit burden scales were used to measure quality of life and caregivers' burden at the beginning and at the end of the study.","67 patients were randomised and 33 were included in the experimental group. Evolution scores, which measured the difference between baseline and final scores, showed an improvement in patients' and caregivers' quality of life and an alleviated burden for experimental group caregivers.","An educational programme for caregivers encourages the involvement of patients, informal caregivers and health-care providers in a triangular relationship which enhances the quality of life of patients and caregivers alike and decreases caregivers' burden. Care organisation should therefore be rethought as a triangular relationship between patients, caregivers and health-care providers, with nurses as the mainstay."
692,19418107,Individuals with a sibling who has had colorectal cancer diagnosed before age 61 are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and may derive particular benefit from screening. Tailored interventions may increase participation in appropriate colorectal cancer screening.,This study evaluated the efficacy of two tailored interventions and a generic print intervention.,"Participant siblings (N = 412) who were not up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening were randomly assigned to receive either a generic print pamphlet, a tailored print pamphlet, or a tailored print pamphlet and tailored counseling call. Colorectal cancer screening 6 months after the baseline interview was the outcome measure.",Results indicated that colorectal cancer screening adherence increased among intermediate risk siblings enrolled in all three intervention groups. Participants in both tailored intervention groups reported having colorectal cancer screening at significantly higher rates than participants in the generic print group. The increase in colorectal cancer screening in the tailored print and counseling call group was not significantly higher than that achieved by the tailored print alone. Decisional balance partially mediated treatment effects. Tailored behavioral interventions are effective methods for increasing screening adherence but telephone counseling did not add significantly to treatment effects.
693,17226851,"Evidence suggests that cancer diagnosed during adolescence and young adulthood may present considerable challenges to what would otherwise be a relatively smooth developmental trajectory, particularly in areas related to reproductive health. We created and pilot tested a two-session, individually-delivered, counseling intervention to enhance psychosexual development in this unique population.","A total of 21 patients, aged 15 to 25 years and treated for cancer within the past 5 years, completed the counseling intervention. Patients were adaptively randomized to begin the intervention immediately, or to be placed on a 3-month waitlist, after which time, they were reassessed and began the intervention. The content of the intervention included education, dialog, and support regarding cancer and such issues as sexual development and function, body image, fertility, prevention of sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancy, and romantic relationships (e.g., dating, sexual communication). A 1-month follow-up booster call followed the intervention. Questionnaires were completed at baseline, post-waitlist (for half the sample), post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up.",Participation in the intervention increased cancer-specific knowledge regarding sexual issues; improved body image; lessened anxiety about sexual and romantic relationships; and decreased overall level of psychological distress. Gains were maintained through the 3-month follow-up.,Addressing issues of reproductive health in the adolescent/young adult with cancer can and should be offered as a part of comprehensive pediatric cancer care.
694,15199624,"To observe the clinical efficacy of TCM with supplementing Qi, nourishing Yin and clearing heat principle (SQNYCH) combined with chemotherapy in treating myelocytic leukemia.","One hundred and fourteen patients were randomly divided into the treated group (n = 68) and the control group (n = 46). To the treated group, SQNYCH was applied as the basic treatment, with combined chemotherapeutic protocol, using DA, HA and IA, to induce remission, and to the M3 patients, all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide were given. As for patients in the control group, only western medicine was administered.","In the treated group 49 patients (72.1%) were completely remitted, 9 (13.2%) partially remitted and the total remission rate being 85.3%, which was significantly different from that in the control group. After treatment, the blood and bone marrow picture were obviously improved in both groups, but the increase of hemoglobin and platelet were better in the treated group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01). Immune functions were enhanced in both groups, but the elevation of CD4, CD4/CD8 ratio and NK cells were higher in the treated group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01).","Application of SQNYCH principle in treating acute myelocytic leukemia could elevate the clinical efficacy, which is of great value in clinical practice."
695,29573047,"This study assessed the effects of a group intervention-Siblings Coping Together (SibCT)-on siblings' and caregivers' anxiety symptoms compared to controls, and potential moderators.","Seventy healthy siblings of children on or off treatment (7-16\u00a0y old, 41 males) participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 2 arms/groups: SibCT (n\u00a0=\u00a041) and an attention control (CG) (n\u00a0=\u00a034). Both groups had eight 2-hour weekly sessions. EG followed SibCT's educational, social, and problem-solving activities. CG had planned games and crafts. Siblings and caregivers self-reported on anxiety symptoms at baseline, intervention end, and 3\u00a0months later. Multivariable mixed model analyses examined the intervention effect over time, and potential moderators (gender, on/off ill child's treatment).","No main effects of group or time were found in sibling scores. A group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0gender interaction (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.05) indicated that in the intervention group female siblings reported less total anxiety symptoms than male siblings, with no significant gender differences in the control group. Caregivers' total anxiety symptoms declined over time (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.02). A group\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0on/off treatment interaction in physiological/panic subscale (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.03) indicated that when ill child was on treatment, caregivers of siblings in SibCT reported less anxiety compared with caregivers of CG.","There was no clear SibCT intervention effect. SibCT may benefit female siblings, and caregivers whose ill child is on active treatment. Contextual factors (gender) seem to influence psychosocial intervention in this population."
696,29237915,To assess the effect of auricular points treatment combined with acupoints application on patient with constipation after lung cancer surgery.,"Design and participants: This is a single-center randomized controlled trial. Totally 341 after lung cancer surgery patients were randomly assigned into the experimental group (n = 174) and the control group (n = 167). The control group received routine nursing care, which was included psychological support, diet instruction, and post-operative activities guidance. The experimental group received auricular points treatment combined with acupoints application therapy in addition to the routine nursing care. All the patients had defecation within 3 days after operation. The characteristics of the stool were recorded, and the progress and performance of the incidence of constipation was recorded in two groups.","The incidence of constipation in the control group was higher than that in the experimental group (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the stool characteristics of experimental group were better than it in the control group by rank-sum test (P = 0.047).","On the basis of routine measures to prevent constipation after lung cancer surgery, auricular point sticking combined with acupoint application therapy can effectively decrease the incidence of postoperative constipation."
697,25877784,The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a clinician referral and exercise program in improving exercise levels and quality of life for men with prostate cancer.,"This was a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial in Melbourne, Australia comprising 15 clinicians: 8 clinicians were randomized to refer eligible participants (n\u2009=\u200954) to a 12-week exercise program comprising 2 supervised gym sessions and 1 home-based session per week, and 7 clinicians were randomized to follow usual care (n\u2009=\u200993). The primary outcome was self-reported physical activity; the secondary outcomes were quality of life, anxiety, and symptoms of depression.","A significant intervention effect was observed for vigorous-intensity exercise (effect size: Cohen's d, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.82; P\u2009=\u2009.010) but not for combined moderate and vigorous exercise levels (effect size: d, 0.08; 95% CI, -0.28 to 0.45; P\u2009=\u2009.48). Significant intervention effects were also observed for meeting exercise guidelines (\u2265150 min/wk; odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.9-7.8; P\u2009=\u2009.002); positive intervention effects were observed in the intervention group for cognitive functioning (effect size: d, 0.34; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.70; P\u2009=\u2009.06) and depression symptoms (effect size: d, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.71 to 0.02; P\u2009=\u2009.06). Eighty percent of participants reported that the clinician's referral influenced their decision to participate in the exercise program.",The clinician referral and 12-week exercise program significantly improved vigorous exercise levels and had a positive impact on mental health outcomes for men living with prostate cancer. Further research is needed to determine the sustainability of the exercise program and its generalizability to other cancer populations.
698,24793004,This study aimed to test the feasibility of implementing a psychoeducational intervention program for gynecological cancer patients.,"A single-blinded randomized controlled trial and mixed-method design were used. Study subjects were newly diagnosed gynecological cancer patients with surgery as the first-line treatment. They were randomly assigned to the intervention group, in which a psychoeducational intervention program based on a thematic counseling model was offered, or to the attention control group. Quantitative data on sexual functioning, quality of life, uncertainty, anxiety, depression and social support were collected at recruitment, post-operative and during the in-hospital period, and eight weeks after the operation. Participants in the intervention group and three nurses working in the clinical setting were invited to have semi-structured interviews.","Of the 30 eligible subjects, 26 were successfully recruited into the study. Following the psychoeducational intervention program, there was significant improvement in the level of inconsistent information about the illness within the category of uncertainty among participants in the intervention group. In addition, trends towards improvement were demonstrated in quality of life, uncertainty, depression and perceived social support with the provision of the interventions. Qualitative data indicated the interventions were desired and appreciated by the participants, as well as being feasible and practical to implement in Hong Kong clinical settings.",The findings suggest that it is feasible to deliver the psychoeducational intervention program and it may have beneficial effects in gynecological cancer patients. A full-scale study is warranted to confirm the results.
699,22993332,The study aimed at determining whether physical exercise training improves the quality of life (QoL) and physical fitness of breast cancer survivors.,"A total of 573 breast cancer survivors were randomized into an exercise or a control group, 12-months after adjuvant treatments. EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR-23 questionnaires were used for evaluation of QoL, FACIT-F for fatigue and the Finnish modified version of Beck's 13-item depression scale (RBDI) for depression. Physical fitness was assessed by a 2-km walking test, and a figure-8 running test and physical activity (PA) by metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week (MET-h/wk).","Figure-8 running time improved significantly among the patients of the intervention group compared with the controls (p&lt;0.001). No significant between-group differences were observed in 2-km walking time, in PA, EORTC-QLQ-C30, BR-23, FACIT-F or BDI. However, there was a linear relationship between increased PA and improved QoL (p=0.006), irrespective of the intervention.","Increase in physical activity was associated with improved QoL, but no effect of the exercise intervention was observed."
700,16568409,"Aerobic exercise training has been shown to have beneficial effects on quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer survivors. However, the effects of weight training on psychological benefits are unknown. We sought to examine the effects of weight training on changes in QOL and depressive symptoms in recent breast cancer survivors.",A convenience sample of 86 survivors (4-36 months posttreatment) was randomized into treatment and control groups. The primary outcomes were changes in QOL (CARES short form) and depressive symptoms (CES-D) between baseline and month 6 in this randomized controlled trial.,"Over 6 months the physical global QOL score improved in the treatment group compared with the control group (Standardized Difference = 0.62, P = .006). The psychosocial global score also improved significantly in the treatment group compared with the control group (Standardized Difference = 0.52, P = .02). There were no changes in CES-D scores. Increases in upper body strength were correlated with improvements in physical global score (r = 0.32; P &lt;.01) and psychosocial global score (r = 0.30; P &lt;.01). Increases in lean mass were also correlated with improvements in physical global score (r = 0.23; P &lt;.05) and psychosocial global score (r = 0.24; P &lt;.05).","Twice-weekly weight training for recent breast cancer survivors may result in improved QOL, in part via changes in body composition and strength."
701,30717942,"Breast cancer is the leading form of cancer among women in Nigeria. The care of such patients has shifted from hospital-based care to home and community care, with the resultant increase in responsibility and burden on caregivers. The study aimed to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention programme on the quality of life (QOL) and caregiver burden of the primary caregivers of women with breast cancer.","This was a quasi-experimental study with 108 primary caregivers (54 in both intervention and control groups). The intervention comprised six 90-min educational sessions, held weekly. Topics included information about breast cancer, the emotional aspect of caring, adjustment to the role of caregiver and communication strategies. The intervention group received the psychosocial intervention programme in addition to routine care, and the control group received routine care. Primary outcome (caregiver burden) and caregiver QOL were measured using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) and Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CQOLC) at baseline, week six and week 12.","The psychosocial intervention reduced caregiver burden at both T1 and T2 (p\u202f=\u202f0.000, p\u202f=\u202f0.018 respectively) and improved the caregiver QOL (p\u202f=\u202f0.000, p\u202f=\u202f0.020 respectively) in the intervention group compared to the control group.",The psychosocial intervention programme had a positive effect on caregiver burden and QOL. Issues such as sustainability of such programmes and advocacy relating to caregiver burden need further research.
702,10547552,"The Physicians' Health Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial design including supplementation with beta-carotene (50 mg every other day) in the primary prevention of cancer among 22,071 U.S. male physicians ages 40-84 years at randomization. Before randomization, the authors collected baseline blood specimens to determine whether any benefit was greater among or confined to those with low baseline levels of beta-carotene.","Baseline blood samples were collected from 14,916 participants. These samples were assayed, according to a nested case-control design, from 1439 men subsequently diagnosed with cancer over 12 years of follow-up (631 with prostate carcinoma) and 2204 controls matched by age and smoking habits.","Men in the lowest quartile for plasma beta-carotene at baseline had a marginally significant (P = 0.07) increased risk of cancer compared with those in the highest quartile (relative risk [RR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.74). Men in the lowest quartile assigned at random to beta-carotene supplementation had a possible but nonsignificant decrease in overall cancer risk (RR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.63-1.09) compared with those assigned to placebo. This was primarily due to a significant reduction in the risk of prostate carcinoma (RR = 0.68, 95% CI, 0. 46-0.99) in this group. After the first 2 years of follow-up were excluded, the results were virtually unchanged.",These prespecified subgroup analyses appeared to support the idea that beta-carotene supplementation may reduce risk of prostate carcinoma among those with low baseline levels. Further follow-up of this population will help determine whether these findings are valid.
703,29721714,"This multicenter, randomized controlled study evaluates the safety of early oral feeding following gastrectomy, and its effect on the length of postoperative hospital stay.",The subjects of this study were patients who underwent distal gastrectomy (DG) or total gastrectomy (TG) for gastric cancer between January 2014 and December 2015. Patients were randomly assigned to the early oral feeding group (intervention group) or the conventional postoperative management group (control group) for each procedure. We evaluated the length of postoperative hospital stay and the incidence of postoperative complications in each group.,"No significant differences in length of postoperative stay were found between the intervention and control groups of the patients who underwent DG. The incidence of postoperative complications was significantly greater in the DG intervention group. In contrast, the length of postoperative stay was significantly shorter in the TG intervention group, although the TG group did not attain the established target sample size.",Early oral feeding did not shorten the postoperative hospital stay after DG. The higher incidence of postoperative complications precluded the unselected adoption of early oral feeding for DG patients. Further confirmative studies are required to definitively establish the potential benefits of early oral feeding for TG patients.
704,15599947,"The purpose of this study was to determine if patients with advanced breast cancer and their family caregivers, who participated in a family based intervention, report better quality of life and other psychosocial outcomes than dyads who received standard care alone.","Using a randomized clinical trial, 134 patients and their family caregivers were assigned to usual care (control) or to usual care plus the family intervention (experimental condition). Dyads were assessed at baseline, three- and six-months later. The intervention consisted of five sessions and addressed family involvement, optimistic attitude, coping effectiveness, uncertainty reduction, and symptom management.","Patients in the family intervention reported significantly less hopelessness and less negative appraisal of illness than controls; their family caregivers reported significantly less negative appraisal of caregiving. Intervention effects were evident at three-months, but were not sustained at six-months. No difference was found in the quality of life of dyads in experimental or control conditions.","Although the family intervention had positive effects initially, these effects were not sustained over time. Future studies need to consider program dose and duration of effect, outcome measures that are more sensitive to change, and realistic end-points for patients with advanced cancer."
705,14987957,This study examined the effect of a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention on emotional well-being and immune function among women in the months following surgery for early-stage breast cancer.,Twenty-nine women were randomly assigned to receive either a 10-week CBSM intervention (n=18) or a comparison experience (n=11). The primary psychological outcome measure was benefit finding. The primary immune function outcome measure was in vitro lymphocyte proliferative response to anti CD3.,"Women in the CBSM intervention reported greater perceptions of benefit from having breast cancer compared to the women in the comparison group. At 3-month follow-up, women in the CBSM group also had improved lymphocyte proliferation. Finally, increases in benefit finding after the 10-week intervention predicted increases in lymphocyte proliferation at the 3-month follow-up.",A CBSM intervention for women with early-stage breast cancer facilitated positive emotional responses to their breast cancer experience in parallel with later improvement in cellular immune function.
706,16006422,"We examined the efficacy of a cancer prevention intervention designed to improve health behaviors among working-class, multiethnic populations employed in small manufacturing businesses.","Worksites were randomly assigned to an intervention or minimal-intervention control condition. The intervention targeted fruit and vegetable consumption, red meat consumption, multivitamin use, and physical activity.",Employees in the intervention group showed greater improvements for every outcome compared with employees in the control group. Differences in improvement were statistically significant for multivitamin use and physical activity. Intervention effects were larger among workers than among managers for fruit and vegetable consumption and for physical activity.,The social-context model holds promise for reducing disparities in health behaviors. Further research is needed to improve the effectiveness of the intervention.
707,12577413,To observe the leukocyte increasing effects of Shaunghuang Shengbai Granule (SHSBG) in tumor patients treated by chemotherapy (CT) and its function on bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment in mice.,"Patients of non-small-cell lung cancer and breast, gastric or intestinal cancer, who were retreated with CT, were enrolled and divided into 4 groups randomly. The 28 cases in the treated group 1 received SHSBG and CT simultaneously. The 27 cases in the treated group 2 also received firstly CT, and SHSBG started when WBC count lowered to less than 4 x 10(9)/L after CT. The control group 1 and 2 (n = 33 and n = 24) was treated by the method similar to that applied to the treated group 1 and 2 respectively but with Rubidate instead of SHSBG. Experimental study of observing bone marrow ultrastructure in mice was also conducted with electron microscopy.","The total leukocyte increasing effective rate occurred in the treated group 1 was 75.00%, that in the treated group 2 was 88.89%, in the control group 1 was 54.55% and in the control group 2 was 58.33%. There was significant difference between the treated groups and the control groups (P &lt; 0.01). Experimental study showed that SHSBG has good bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironmental protecting and improving effect in mice.",SHSBG has obvious protecting and treating effect on CT caused bone marrow suppression in tumor patients.
708,17627015,Individuals with a first-degree relative who has had colorectal cancer are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and thus can benefit from early detection. Tailored risk counseling may increase adherence to screening guidelines in these persons. The present study evaluated a culturally sensitive Colon Cancer Risk Counseling (CCRC) intervention for relatives of colorectal cancer patients.,"A randomized trial evaluated personalized CCRC sessions with print materials and follow-up phone calls compared with a comparable General Health Counseling (GHC) intervention. One hundred and seventy-six siblings and children of colorectal cancer patients, living in Hawaii, were assessed at baseline and 4 and 12 months after intervention. Physician verification of colorectal cancer screening reports supplemented survey data.","The CCRC intervention had a significant treatment effect at 4 months (13% greater increase than for GHC) that plateaued to a trend at 12 months. For those who were nonadherent at baseline, the CCRC led to a 17% net increase in screening adherence. Participants rated the CCRC intervention better than GHC for the amount and usefulness of new information.","Using a study design that compared risk counseling to an attention-matched and tailored control condition provided a rigorous test of CCRC that emphasized the relevance of family experience with colorectal cancer. The combination face-to-face, phone, and small media risk counseling intervention for people with a family history of colorectal cancer should be considered for adoption in health care and public health settings."
709,29776873,"Our aim was to investigate the effect of reflexology and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercises on pain, fatigue, and quality of life (QoL) of gynecologic cancer patients during chemotherapy.","Eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: reflexology, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercises, both (reflexology\u00a0+\u00a0PMR), or a control group.

710,17265529,"Although smoking and alcohol consumption are the major risk factors for upper aerodigestive tract cancers, observational studies indicate a protective role for fruits, vegetables, and antioxidant nutrients.","The authors examined whether daily supplementation with 50 mg dl alpha-tocopheryl acetate and/or 20 mg beta-carotene reduced the incidence of or mortality from oral/pharyngeal, esophageal, and laryngeal cancers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial conducted in southwestern Finland. A total of 29,133 male smokers, aged 50-69 years and free of cancer at baseline, were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to the supplementation regimen for 5-8 years (median, 6.1 years). Incident cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (n = 65), esophagus (n = 24), and larynx (n = 56) were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry. Intervention effects were assessed using survival analysis and proportional hazards models.","There was no effect of either agent on the overall incidence of any upper aerodigestive tract cancer. For larynx, however, exploratory subgroup analyses were suggestive of a protective effect of beta-carotene supplementation on the incidence of early stage malignancies (stage I, relative risk [RR], 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10-0.75). Neither agent affected mortality from these neoplasms.","The results do not provide support for a protective effect of vitamin E or beta-carotene supplementation on upper aerodigestive tract cancers, although beta-carotene supplementation may impact the incidence of some subtypes of laryngeal tumors."
711,23632235,The aims of this study were to determine the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) supplementation on inflammatory factors and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes in rectal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiothetrapy.,"In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study, 34 volunteer patients with rectal cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy assigned into the CLA group (n = 16), receiving 3 g CLA/d, and placebo group (n = 18) receiving placebo capsules (sunflower oil) for 6 weeks. The supplementation began 1 week before starting RT (loading period) and continued every day during treatment. Before and after intervention, serum tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, MMP-2, MMP-9, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and immunoturbidimetric method, respectively. Independent t tests and paired t tests were used to compare parameters between and within groups, respectively.","In the CLA group, the mean serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, hsCRP, MMP-9, and MMP-2 levels reduced insignificantly. However, significant changes in TNF-\u03b1 (P = 0.04), hsCRP (P = 0.03), and MMP-9 (P = 0.04) concentrations were observed in the CLA group when compared with the placebo group. The mean serum IL-6 level remained unchanged in the CLA group but increased remarkably in the placebo group.","According to our results, CLA supplementation improved inflammatory factors, MMP-2, and MMP-9 as biomarkers of angiogenesis and tumor invasion. It seems that CLA may provide new complementary treatment by reducing tumor invasion and resistance to cancer treatment in patients with rectal cancer."
712,15723745,"The effect of fish oil (FO), melatonin (MLT), or their combination and dietary advice on cachexia and biochemistry variables reflecting cachexia were investigated in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer.","Twenty-four patients not amenable to standard anticancer treatment and with documented weight loss and/or decreased serum albumin were included.

Clinical benefit was measured using an 8-item validated Patient Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ) during and up to 11 months after RT.",301 patients completed one or more PBQ assessments. Amifostine patients had significantly better PBQ scores (p &lt; 0.05) than controls. The improvement in PBQ scores was most significant during chronic xerostomia.,"Amifostine use results in improved Patient Benefit Questionnaire (PBQ) scores, which is indicative of improved oral toxicity related outcomes and improved clinical benefit. Less oral toxicity should lead to preservation of late dental and oral health, and improvements in activities such as diet, nutrition, and sleep."
714,11966630,To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback with verbal instructions as learning tools of pelvic muscle exercises (PMEs) in the early management of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.,"Forty-two consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, sd 4.2), with urinary incontinence after radical retropubic prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer, were randomized to receive biofeedback (group A, 28 men) or verbal feedback (group B, 14 men) as learning tools for PMEs immediately after catheter removal. Group A received 15 sessions of EMG biofeedback (three times weekly, 30 min each) and group B verbal instructions. Evaluation at baseline and 1, 2, 3 and 6 months included the 1-h pad-test and a questionnaire (number of pads/day and incontinence episodes).","By the last follow-up, 27 patients had received biofeedback and 15 verbal instructions. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Urine loss as assessed by the 1-h pad-test at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months was 39, 18, 7, 4 and 3 g for group A and 31, 11, 3, 1 and 0 g for group B, respectively (P &gt; 0.05). The number of pads/day was 3.9, 3.4, 1.2, 0.8 and 0.4 for group A and 3.6, 1.8, 0.9, 0.4 and 0.2 for group B, respectively (P &gt; 0.05). The overall continence rate at 6 months was objectively (urine loss &gt; 1 g) 91% and subjectively (0-1 pad/day) 95%.",Intensive verbal instructions and biofeedback were both very effective behavioural methods and learning tools for PMEs in the early management of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.
715,21272319,Cruciferous vegetable intake is inversely associated with the risk of several cancers. Isothiocyanates (ITC) are hypothesized to be the major bioactive constituents contributing to these cancer-preventive effects. The polymorphic glutathione-S-transferase (GST) gene family encodes several enzymes which catalyze ITC degradation in vivo.,"We utilized high throughput proteomics methods to examine how human serum peptides (the &quot;peptidome&quot;) change in response to cruciferous vegetable feeding in individuals of different GSTM1 genotypes. In two randomized, crossover, controlled feeding studies (EAT and 2EAT) participants consumed a fruit- and vegetable-free basal diet and the basal diet supplemented with cruciferous vegetables. Serum samples collected at the end of the feeding period were fractionated and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry spectra were obtained. Peak identification/alignment computer algorithms and mixed effects models were used to analyze the data.","After analysis of spectra from EAT participants, 24 distinct peaks showed statistically significant differences associated with cruciferous vegetable intake. Twenty of these peaks were driven by their GSTM1 genotype (i.e., GSTM1+ or GSTM1- null). When data from EAT and 2EAT participants were compared by joint processing of spectra to align a common set, 6 peaks showed consistent changes in both studies in a genotype-dependent manner. The peaks at 6700 m/z and 9565 m/z were identified as an isoform of transthyretin (TTR) and a fragment of zinc \u03b12-glycoprotein (ZAG), respectively.","Cruciferous vegetable intake in GSTM1+ individuals led to changes in circulating levels of several peptides/proteins, including TTR and a fragment of ZAG. TTR is a known marker of nutritional status and ZAG is an adipokine that plays a role in lipid mobilization. The results of this study present evidence that the GSTM1-genotype modulates the physiological response to cruciferous vegetable intake."
716,18299490,We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of patient decision support Web sites on decision quality for men considering prostate cancer screening.,"Men older than 50 years (N = 611) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 Internet conditions: traditional didactic decision aid providing information about prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening options and outcomes; chronic disease trajectory model for prostate cancer followed by a time-trade-off exercise; both the didactic decision aid and the chronic disease trajectory model; or links to public prostate cancer-specific Web sites from credible sources (control condition). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline and after their physical examination. Primary outcome measures were PSA test choice, prostate cancer treatment preferences, knowledge and concern about prostate cancer, and decisional conflict.","Participants assigned to view public Web sites were less likely to review information (116 participants [76.8%] reviewed) than those assigned to experimental groups (399 [86.7%] reviewed; P = .004). Greater reductions in PSA screening from pretest to posttest were observed among participants assigned to the traditional decision aid (-9.1%) or chronic disease trajectory model (-8.7%), compared with participants assigned to the combination (-5.3%) or control (-3.3%) groups (P = .047). Preferences for watchful waiting increased significantly in all 4 groups (baseline, 219 [35.8%]; follow-up, 303 [66.2%]; P &lt; .001). Knowledge scores were lowest for those assigned to public Web sites (mean [SD] score, 7.49 [0.19] of questions correct) and highest for the traditional decision aid (8.65 [0.18] of questions correct; P = .005).",Public Web sites about prostate cancer provide less effective decision support than a specially designed Internet decision aid.
717,11477859,To observe the effect of Chinese herbal medicine on the salivary glands of patients with head and neck cancer during radiotherapy (RT).,"Fifty cases with head and neck cancer were randomly divided into observation group treated with RT plus Chinese herbal medicine and control group treated with RT alone. The level of mouth dryness, the flow and secretion speed of salivary amylase were measured before and during the RT.","The severity of mouth dryness increased and the flow and secretion speed of salivary amylase declined during RT. The mouth dryness curve of patients in Chinese medicine group was significantly more flattened than that of the control group after RT. The flow and the secretion speed of salivary amylase of the observation group were significantly higher than those of the control group at 20 Gy, 40 Gy and 60 Gy.",Chinese herbal medicine used in this study was effective to relieve the severity of mouth dryness and to protect the salivary glands of patients with head and neck cancer during RT.
718,22411387,The beneficial effect of eicosapentaenoic acid in cancer patients is widely described especially in relation to its role in tumour cachexia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of administration of a new oral powder supplement enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid compared to a standard liquid supplement in cancer patients.,"A total of 61 cancer patients, aged more than 18 years, were randomized to receive during a month a bonus of 600 kcal/ day to their regular diet with an oral powder supplement enriched with eicosapentaenoic acid (1.5 g) (RSI) or with a standard liquid supplement (RE). The following data were collected at baseline and after one month: the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (pg-SGA), anthropometric measurements (skin folds, circumferences and bioimpedance), dietary parameters (3-day food record), biochemical and inflammatory parameters (basic biochemistry, cytokines, prealbumin and Reactive C Protein). Quality of life was evaluated using the SF-36 questionnaire. At the end, scales were used to asses sensory perception, tolerance and satiety induced by the products and motivation to eat.","40 patients completed the study. After intervention, anthropometric parameters do not change and prealbumin values increased significantly in both groups (RSI 16.11 \u00b1 5.66 mg/dl vs. 19.81 \u00b1 6.75 mg/dl p &lt; 0.05 and RE 6.13 \u00b1 16.55 mg/dl vs. 19.03 \u00b1 5.47 mg / dl p &lt; 0.05). RSI group significantly decreased interferon gamma (INF-\u03b3) values (0.99 \u00b1 0.95 vs. 0.65 \u00b1 0.92 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, RE group increased INF-\u03b3 after intervention (1.62 \u00b1 1 27 vs. 2.2 \u00b1 3.19 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in hunger, appetite, satiety and intake capacity in both groups. The SF-36 scores improved in both groups.",Supplementation based on an oral powder formula enriched with 1.5 g EPA during one month in cancer patients improved certain inflammatory parameters. This product may be a novel and valuable option to be added to the nutritional intervention strategies used for cancer patients.
719,16766775,Higher plasma micronutrient levels have been associated with decreased cancer risks. The objective of this study was to determine the relative effects of reduced fat and/or increased fruit-vegetable (FV) intakes on plasma micronutrient levels.,"Healthy, premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer (n = 122) were randomized across four diet arms for one year in a 2 x 2 factorial design study: control, low-fat, high fruit-vegetable and combination low-fat/high FV diets. Levels of plasma micronutrients were measured in plasma at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months.","The high FV intervention, regardless of fat intake, significantly increased alpha-carotene, beta-carotene and vitamin C levels in plasma. Only the combination high FV, low-fat intervention significantly increased plasma beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin levels over time. Although alpha-tocopherol was not affected, a potential concern is that the low-fat intervention resulted in significantly decreased both gamma-tocopherol dietary intakes and plasma levels, regardless of whether or not FV intakes were concomitantly increased.","Unlike alpha-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol plasma levels were decreased by a low fat diet, perhaps because gamma-tocopherol is not generally added to foods nor widely used in vitamin E supplements. The decreased dietary intakes and plasma levels of gamma-tocopherol with a low-fat diet may have implications for health risks since the biological functions of the different tocopherol isomers have been reported to be distinct."
720,12529346,"Results of several studies have suggested that diet during adolescence may influence the risk of breast cancer in adulthood. We evaluated whether an intervention to lower fat intake among adolescent girls altered their serum concentrations of sex hormones that, in adults, are related to breast cancer development.","We conducted an ancillary hormone study among 286 of the 301 girls who participated between 1988 and 1997 in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children, in which healthy, prepubertal, 8- to 10-year-olds with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were randomly assigned to usual care or to a behavioral intervention that promoted a low-fat diet. Median time on the intervention was 7 years. Blood samples collected before randomization and at the year 1, year 3, year 5, and last visits were assayed to determine the girls' serum levels of sex hormones. All P values are two-sided.","At the year 5 visit, girls in the intervention group had 29.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.4% to 47.9%; P =.02) lower estradiol, 30.2% (95% CI = 7.0% to 47.7%; P =.02) lower non-sex hormone binding globulin-bound estradiol, 20.7% (95% CI = 4.7% to 34.0%; P =.02) lower estrone, and 28.7% (95% CI = 5.1% to 46.5%; P =.02) lower estrone sulfate levels during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and 27.2% (95% CI = 5.7% to 53.1%; P =.01) higher testosterone levels during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle than did girls in the usual care group. At the last visit, the luteal phase progesterone level was 52.9% (95% CI = 20.0% to 72.3%) lower for girls in the intervention group than for girls in the usual care group (P =.007).",Modest reductions in fat intake during puberty are associated with changes in sex hormone concentrations that are consistent with alterations in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Whether these changes influence breast cancer risk is currently unknown.
721,30077574,To evaluate the effects of combined aerobic\u202f+\u202fresistance training on body composition and metabolic markers in older breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy.,"Older breast cancer survivors were randomized to an exercise [resistance\u202f+\u202faerobic training]: n\u202f=\u202f18, or placebo control group: n\u202f=\u202f18. Body composition (measured by DXA) and blood markers of lipid and glucose were measured at baseline, and at 12, 24, and 36\u202fweeks. The exercise group performed 40\u202fmin of resistance exercises on machines followed by 30\u202fmin of aerobic training on a treadmill, three times per week. Separate 2 (group)\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 (time) repeated-measure ANOVAs were used to compare groups over time.","Significant group\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime interactions were found for total and trunk fat mass (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001 and p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and % body fat (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.001), where women in the exercise group lost fat compared to slight gains among women in the stretching control group. There were no significant differences between groups for lean mass, hip or spine BMD, metabolic markers, or CRP.","Our aerobic\u202f+\u202fresistance exercise program prevented fat gain, but may not have been sufficient to improve metabolic or bone health markers in older breast cancer survivors undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy."
722,29470705,"Cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) is a long-term side effect of breast cancer therapy. Both calcitriol and weight-bearing exercise improve bone metabolism for osteoporotic patients, but are unproven in a breast cancer population. We used a novel high-dose calcitriol regimen with an individualized exercise intervention to improve bone metabolism in breast cancer survivors.","We accrued 41 subjects to this open label, 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 factorial, randomized feasibility trial. Breast cancer survivors were randomized to receive the following: (1) calcitriol (45 micrograms/week), (2) individualized exercise with progressive walking and resistance training, (3) both, or (4) a daily multivitamin (control condition) for 12\u00a0weeks. Primary outcomes included changes in biomarkers of bone formation, bone resorption, and the bone remodeling index, a composite measure of bone formation and resorption. Safety measures included clinical and biochemical adverse events. A main effect analysis was used for these endpoints.","Hypercalcemia was limited to three grade I cases with no grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 cases. Among exercisers, 100% engaged in the prescribed aerobic training and 44.4% engaged in the prescribed resistance training. Calcitriol significantly improved bone formation (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.64; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01), resulting in a non-significant increase in the bone remodeling index (Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.21; p\u2009=\u200931). Exercise failed to improve any of the bone biomarkers.","Both calcitriol and exercise were shown to be feasible and well tolerated. Calcitriol significantly improved bone formation, resulting in a net increase of bone metabolism. Compliance with the exercise intervention was sub-optimal, which may have led to a lack of effect of exercise on bone metabolism."
723,10719136,The present study evaluated the feasibility and potential immunological benefit of a presurgical intervention for breast cancer patients.,"Forty-one newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were randomized into control (standard care) and intervention groups. In addition to standard care, intervention group members received a two-session psychosocial intervention. Blood was drawn at three timepoints: (1) at preintervention; (2) at postintervention/presurgery; and (3) at postsurgery.","Examination of the immunological data revealed evidence of suppression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the control group over time, but not in the intervention group. Secondary findings related to psychological assessment generally paralleled the IFN-gamma results.",The relevance and applicability of these findings to future breast cancer intervention research is detailed.
724,17396040,The aim of this study was to compare a conventional oncological inpatient rehabilitation programme with an inpatient step-by-step rehabilitation programme with regard to quality of life in breast cancer patients.,"Women with the diagnosis of breast cancer were randomly assigned to either the step-by-step programme (group A: 3-week rehabilitation plus 4 and 8 months later a 1-week sojourn each time) or the conventional rehabilitation programme (group B: 4- week stay and no further interventions afterwards). Quality of life was assessed with the QLQ-C30 of the EORTC at t0 (beginning of the study), t1 (end of 3- or 4-week stay) and t2 (12 months after t0, end of study).","Between t0 and t1, a tendency (0.1 &gt; p = 0.05) could be shown in group B towards better improvement in global quality of life and emotional function. In the subgroup of patients that had impaired functions of quality of life at t0, superiority in group B reached significance (p &lt; 0.05) for emotional and cognitive function at t1. Between t1 and t2, cognitive function improved further in group A, but diminished in group B. For the subgroup of patients with impaired cognitive function at t0, this difference between both groups became significant (p = 0.0098).","Although not generally superior to conventional inpatient rehabilitation programmes, the analysed step-by- step rehabilitation provided marked benefits for patients with cognitive impairments."
725,20697941,"To observe the clinical effectiveness of a topical application of Xiaozheng Zhitong: Paste (, XZP) in alleviating the cancerous pain of patients with middle/late stage cancer","By: adopting a random number table, 124 patients enrolled were randomized into the treatment group (64 patients) and the control group (60 patients). In addition to the basic therapy [including the three-ladder (3L) analgesia] used in both groups, topical application of XZP was given to patients in the treatment group for pain alleviation. The analgesic efficacy was recorded in terms of pain intensity, analgesia initiating time and sustaining time, and the optimal analgesic effect revealing time. Meanwhile, the quality of life (QOL) and adverse reactions that occurred in patients were recorded as well.","The total effective rate in the treatment group was: 84.38% (54/64), and in the control group it was 88.33% (53/60), showing no significant difference between them (P&gt;0.05), but the analgesia initiating time and the optimal analgesia effect revealing time in the treatment group were significantly shorter (both P&lt;0.01). Moreover, XZP was better in improving patients' QOL, showing more significant improvements in the treatment group than those in the control group in aspects of mental condition, walking capacity, working capacity, social acceptability, sleep and joy of living (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). Lower incidence of adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, mouth dryness, dizziness, etc., especially constipation, was noted in the treatment group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01).","Applying an external compress: of XZP showed a synergistic action with 3L analgesia for shortening the initiating time and the optimal effect revealing time, and could evidently enhance patients' QOL with fewer adverse reactions."
726,23650803,To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at different time-points after cervical carcinoma surgery on urinary bladder function of uroschesis patients so as to determine the optimum time of acupuncture intervention.,"Sixty cervical cancer post-operation patients with catheter due to uroschesis were randomly and equally divided into late treatment group (acupuncture intervention was given from the over 15th day on after surgery) and early treatment group (acupuncture was given from the 7th day to the 14th day after surgery). Bilateral Shangliao (BL 31), Ciliao (BL 32), Zhongliao (BL 33), Xialiao (BL 34), Zhibian (BL 54), Yinlingquan (SP 9) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6) were punctured with filiform needles combined with electrical stimulation of bilateral BL 31 and BL 34 for 30 min, once daily for 10 sessions. The residual urine volume was measured before treatment and after 5 and 10 sessions of treatment separately.","After 5 and 10 sessions of treatment, the average residual urine volumes of both late treatment and early treatment groups were decreased significantly ( P&lt; 0.05), and the residual urine volume level of the early treatment group was markedly lower than that of the late treatment group (P &lt; 0.05). After 5 sessions of acupuncture treatment, of the two 30 cases in the late treatment and early treatment groups, 8 and 17 had an automatic micturition, 22 and 13 needed catheter retention, and following 10 sessions of treatment, 22 and 27 had an automatic micturition, and 8 and 3 still needed catheter retention, respectively. Regarding the functional recovery state of the urinary bladder, of the two 30 cases in the late treatment and early treatment groups, 6 and 14 were good, 24 and 16 poor respectively following 5 sessions of treatment; 15 and 22 were good, 15 and 8 were poor respectively following 10 sessions of treatment. The therapeutic effects of the early treatment group were apparently superior to those of the late treatment group. The number of the treatment sessions for recovering the bladder function was obviously fewer in the early treatment group than in the late treatment group (P &lt; 0.05).",Early acupuncture intervention is significantly better than late treatment for reducing residual urine volume and promoting bladder function recovery for uroschesis patients undergoing cervical cancer operation.
727,17144438,"Over 15% of children aged 6 to 11 yr are overweight, more than three times as high as a generation earlier. Overweight children are at higher risk for diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and orthopedic problems, as well as psychological problems. Overweight children are also more likely to become overweight adults, with higher risks for heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and some types of cancers. In response to this epidemic, Health Management Consultants of VA, Inc., funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, developed MetaKenkoh, an Internet-based, activity-contingent game for children 9-11 yr of age. The game promotes physical activity through the use of pedometers that are used to relate game performance to children's own daily activity.",We conducted a clinical trial in which children aged 9-11 were randomized to groups that either played the game (Intervention Group - IG) or that monitored only (Control Group - CG).,"Preliminary data indicate that underweight and normal weight children in the IG (n=22) show an increase in activity at one week, as measured by pedometer, whereas there is a drop in steps reported by children in the CG (n=24). In the overweight and at-risk groups, both the IG (n=16) and the CG (n=15) show a slight increase in activity levels.","Activity-contingent games may have the potential to facilitate increased physical activity in children.

731,11943795,"Melanoma is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and incidence is increasing. Survival after treatment is inversely related to the thickness of the tumour at diagnosis. Population screening has the potential to reduce mortality but there is no conclusive evidence of benefit. Such evidence can come best from a randomised trial. Here we describe the design of a community based randomised trial of a population screening programme for melanoma in Queensland, Australia and early results of the first phase of the trial.","A total of 44 communities (aggregate population 560 000 adults aged 30 years or more) will be randomised to receive either a community based screening programme for 3 years or normal practice. The screening programme promotes thorough skin self examination and whole body skin examination by a doctor and provides open access skin cancer screening clinics. In its first phase, the trial is underway in nine intervention and nine control communities. The primary outcome measure is mortality from melanoma during 15 years of follow up.","The first phase of the trial has shown the feasibility of implementing a population skin screening programme including regular skin cancer screening clinics, and has shown the strong support of communities and doctors for the programme. There has been a significant 2.5-fold increase in participation in screening in the intervention communities in this first phase after the first 12 months of the trial and no significant increase in participation in screening in control communities during this period.",The design of a community based randomised trial of screening for melanoma has been successfully peer reviewed and the intervention has been shown to be feasible in practice. This randomised trial may be one of the last opportunities to develop the evidence required for public health recommendations for population screening for melanoma.
732,20186874,To identify the components of a human papillomavirus (HPV) message contributing to reducing the stigma of HPV in cervical cancer.,"294 ethnic Chinese women attending a community-based clinic in Hong Kong were randomly allocated to read one of three written HPV messages: Group 'lr+hrHPV': low-risk and high-risk HPVs facts, Group 'hrHPV': high-risk HPV facts only and Group 'ds+hrHPV': high-risk HPV facts and de-stigmatising components, namely being anti-stereotypical, motivational and low in complexity. Main outcome measures were high-risk HPV-related sexual stigma, knowledge, attitude towards message, and intention to be HPV-tested measured by self-administered questionnaires immediately before and after reading.","Message allocation had a significant effect on sexual stigma (F = 5.219, p = 0.006). Participants who read message ds+hrHPV showed the least stigma, and were significantly less likely to believe that high-risk HPV infection implicated promiscuity, non-monogamy or that monogamy offered complete protection against high-risk HPV. The genital HPV-focused message was more stigmatising than cervical cancer-focused messages. Of all participants, 93% (237/254) and 97% (260/269) indicated a positive intention to be HPV-tested before and after reading, respectively. There were no between-group differences noted in terms of knowledge and intention to be HPV-tested before or after reading.","Our findings show that an HPV message containing specific de-stigmatising components may reduce public stigma towards high-risk HPV. Also, focusing solely on high-risk HPV in the context of cervical cancer helps to avoid the stigmatising effect of genital warts from tainting perceptions about high-risk HPV infection."
733,15971198,"Trials of cognitive-behavioral interventions (CBI) designed to reduce symptom severity or improve dimensions of quality of life seldom consider how the side effects of treatment or the complications imposed by the disease or treatment may moderate the impact of the trial on the designated outcome. To address this issue, the moderating effect of neutropenia on the impact of a CBI for reducing symptom severity was evaluated among patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.","The authors described the impact of a randomized trial of a 10-contact, 20-week CBI on symptom severity, as well as the moderating effect of a neutropenic episode on symptom severity at 20 weeks. Severity scores were based on sum scores (0-10) for 15 symptoms.","There was an effect for age (younger) and group on severity at 20 weeks and an interaction between neutropenia and group. Among patients with no evidence of neutropenia, those in the experimental arm had a 9-point lower severity score at 20 weeks. Among patients who experienced neutropenia, differences in symptom severity by arm of the trial were &lt; 3 points. Further, fatigue, fever, and pain were more prevalent among patients with neutropenia.",Patients who experienced neutropenia did not benefit from a CBI to lower symptoms. The overall effect of this intervention came almost exclusively from patients without neutropenia.
734,10155659,To describe a theoretic approach and rationale for the integration of health protection and health promotion in worksite cancer prevention programs and to describe an intervention study designed to implement this integration.,"Twenty-four worksites were recruited to participate in this randomized, controlled study. The theoretically based intervention model integrates health promotion and health protection through (1) joint worker-management participation in program planning and implementation, (2) consultation on worksite changes, and (3) educational programs targeting health behavior change.","Although the primary purpose of this paper is to describe a theoretic approach to the integration of health promotion and health protection, preliminary results are also noted. In these predominantly manufacturing worksites, many workers faced the double jeopardy of exposures to occupational carcinogens and personal risks such as smoking or poor dietary habits. Production workers' job responsibilities frequently limited their full participation. Barriers to participation were identified early in the project, and strategies were developed to facilitate maximal worker involvement and worksite changes.",Lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation or dietary changes may be more effectively promoted among blue collar audiences when programs also encourage management actions to reduce occupational exposures. Public health professionals trained in health promotion and health protection must work together to effectively address the health concerns of this population.
735,12196367,To evaluate the impact of an educational booklet on women's knowledge of and willingness to participate in a randomized clinical trial of treatment for breast cancer.,"Women undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer were randomized to receive, or not, an information booklet explaining the need for and manner in which randomized trials are conducted.","Eighty-three women with newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer completed a questionnaire assessing attitudes to random clinical trials (RCTs) and were randomized to receive usual information treatment options provided from their oncologist, or the educational booklet in addition to usual information from their oncologist (42 usual information, 41 booklet). Fewer women who received the clinical trials booklet (40% versus 47%) would consider participating in the hypothetical clinical trial (P = 0.6). Mean knowledge scores increased for both groups; moreover, women who did not receive the booklet showed similar improvements to women who received the booklet [mean difference 0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.66 to 0.83]. In a multivariate analysis women who would consider participating in the clinical trial were more anxious [odds ratio (OR) 5.9, P = 0.02] had involved lymph nodes (OR 5.8, P = 0.02) and were less influenced by negative aspects of clinical trials (OR 7.7, P = 0.0001). After adjustment for these variables women who received the educational booklet were significantly less likely to consider trial participation (OR 0.22, P = 0.05).",Educating women about clinical trials in this manner appears ineffective in improving recruitment to RCTs. Women appear to be more influenced by their perception of risk than understanding. This finding has ethical implications for communication of information about RCTs.

Although flushes decreased less in the EA group than in the HT group, HRQoL improved at least to the same extent maybe due to other effects of EA, not induced by HT, e.g. on anxiety, vitality and sleep, supported by subscale analyses. EA should be further evaluated as treatment for women with breast cancer and climacteric complaints, since HT no longer can be recommended for these women."
737,17473199,"This phase I study evaluated the effect of folate supplementation on the toxicity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. It also examined two different types of vitamin supplementation and whether the extent of prior myelosuppressive therapy affected pemetrexed tolerability.","Patients received a 10-min infusion of 600 to 14,00 mg/m(2) pemetrexed every 3 weeks. Patients were stratified into cohorts by pretreatment status [lightly pretreated (LPT) or heavily pretreated (HPT)] and were supplemented with intermittent high-dose folic acid (HDFA) or with continuous daily multivitamins (MVI) containing nutritional doses of folic acid. Pemetrexed plasma pharmacokinetics were evaluated for cycle 1.","Sixty-two HDFA patients (28 HPT and 34 LPT) were treated with 204 cycles of pemetrexed, and 43 MVI patients (20 HPT and 23 LPT) were treated with 182 cycles. Hematologic dose-limiting toxicities included grade 4 neutropenia (5 of 105 patients), grade 4 thrombocytopenia (4 of 105 patients), and febrile neutropenia (3 of 105 patients). Nonhematologic toxicities included fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Pemetrexed doses of 800 and 1,050 mg/m(2) were well tolerated when administered with vitamin supplementation to HPT and LPT patients, respectively. There were no clinically relevant differences in toxicities or pemetrexed pharmacokinetics for LPT versus HPT patients or for patients receiving HDFA versus daily MVI supplementation.","The pemetrexed doses tolerated in this study with vitamin supplementation were significantly higher than those tolerated in earlier studies without supplementation, and toxicities were independent of the type of vitamin supplementation or prior myelosuppressive treatment. The recommended dose of pemetrexed is 1,050 mg/m(2) in LPT patients and 800 mg/m(2) in HPT patients, irrespective of the type of vitamin supplementation."
738,30400784,"Higher levels of physical activity (PA) after treatment are associated with beneficial effects on physical and psychosocial functioning of cancer survivors. However, survivors often do not meet the recommended levels of PA. In order to promote PA, we developed a closed internet-based program. The aim of the study is to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of an internet-based PA-promotion program, alone or combined with physiotherapy counselling, compared to usual care, on PA-levels of breast or prostate cancer survivors. In this multicenter randomised controlled trial (RCT), breast or prostate cancer survivors who completed their primary treatment 3-12\u00a0months earlier, will be randomised to either 6-months access to a fully-automated internet-based intervention alone, an internet-based intervention plus remote support by a physiotherapist, or a control group. The intervention is based on the Transtheoretical Model and includes personalized feedback, information, video's and assignments. Additionally, in a second arm, physiotherapy counselling is provided through monthly scheduled and on-demand telephone calls. The control group will receive usual care and a leaflet with PA guidelines.","At baseline, 6 and 12\u00a0months, the primary outcome (PA) will be measured during 7 consecutive days by accelerometers.

739,29808340,"Informal family caregivers (FCG) are an integral and crucial human component in the cancer care continuum. However, research and interventions to help alleviate documented anxiety and burden on this group is lacking. To address the absence of effective interventions, we developed the electronic Support Network Assessment Program (eSNAP) which aims to automate the capture and visualization of social support, an important target for overall FCG support. This study seeks to describe the preliminary efficacy and outcomes of the eSNAP intervention.","Forty FCGs were enrolled into a longitudinal, two-group randomized design to compare the eSNAP intervention in caregivers of patients with primary brain tumors against controls who did not receive the intervention. Participants were followed for six weeks with questionnaires to assess demographics, caregiver burden, anxiety, depression, and social support. Questionnaires given at baseline (T1) and then 3-weeks (T2), and 6-weeks (T3) post baseline questionnaire.","FCGs reported high caregiver burden and distress at baseline, with burden remaining stable over the course of the study. The intervention group was significantly less depressed, but anxiety remained stable across groups.","With the lessons learned and feedback obtained from FCGs, this study is the first step to developing an effective social support intervention to support FCGs and healthcare providers in improving cancer care."

While there is a growing body of research into phytotherapeutic agents in this cohort, with some promising results, as yet no definitive recommendations can be made. This pilot study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a fully-powered study to examine the effects of this phytotherapeutic intervention (containing turmeric, resveratrol, green tea and broccoli sprouts) on PSA doubling time in men with biochemical recurrence with a moderate PSA rise rate.","A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial was conducted with 22 men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate rise rate (PSA doubling time of 4-15 months and no evidence of metastases from conventional imaging methods). Patients were randomized to either the active treatment arm or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoints were feasibility of study recruitment and procedures, and measurement of proposed secondary endpoints (prostate symptoms, quality of life, anxiety, and depression as measured on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR-25, the IPSS and HADS). Data were collected to estimate PSA-log slopes and PSA-doubling times, using a mixed model, for both the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods.","Adherence to study protocol was excellent, and the phytotherapeutic intervention was well-tolerated, with similar numbers of mild-to-moderate adverse events in the active and placebo arms. Both the intervention and data collection methods were acceptable to participants. No statistical difference between groups on clinical outcomes was expected in this pilot study. There was between-subject variation in the PSA post treatment, but on average the active treatment group experienced a non-significant increase in the log-slope of PSA (pre-treatment doubling time\u2009=\u200910.2 months, post-treatment doubling time\u2009=\u20095.5 months), and the placebo group experienced no change in the log-slope of PSA (pre-treatment doubling time\u2009=\u200910.8 months, post-treatment doubling time\u2009=\u200910.9 months).","The findings suggest that a fully powered study of this combination is feasible in men with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer and a moderate PSA rise rate.

754,11783254,To investigate the clinical value of Fuzheng Yiai Decoction (FZYAD) in postoperational large intestinal Cancer after treatment.,Thirty-eight cases treated by FZYAD combined with chemotherapy in the treated group were observed and compared with 30 patients in the control group treated with chemotherapy alone.,"After treatment, patients' physical strength of the treated group was better than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.01), meanwhile, the median survival time was longer (31.4 months vs 18 months, P &lt; 0.01), the survival rate higher (P &lt; 0.05), and the recurrence rate lower (21.05% vs 48.34%, P &lt; 0.05) in comparison of the treated group and the control group. Moreover, the cellular immune function of the treated group was improved after treatment.","In treatment of postoperational large intestinal cancer, the effect of FZYAD combined chemotherapy is better than that of chemotherapy alone in immune function regulation, cancer inhibition, relapse prevention and survival time prolongation."
755,25691084,The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for radioactive iodine (RAI)-induced anorexia in thyroid cancer patients.,"Fourteen thyroid cancer patients with RAI-induced anorexia were randomized to a true acupuncture or sham acupuncture group. Both groups were given 6 true or sham acupuncture treatments in 2 weeks. Outcome measures included the change of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia and Cachexia Treatment (FAACT; Anorexia/Cachexia Subscale [ACS], Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), weight, body mass index (BMI), ACTH, and cortisol levels.","The mean FAACT ACS scores of the true and sham acupuncture groups increased from baseline to exit in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses; the true acupuncture group showed higher increase but with no statistical significance. Between groups, from baseline to the last treatment, statistically significant differences were found in ITT analysis of the Table of Index (TOI) score (P = .034) and in PP analysis of the TOI (P = .016), FACT-G (P = .045), FAACT (P = .037) scores. There was no significant difference in VAS, weight, BMI, ACTH, and cortisol level changes between groups.","Although the current study is based on a small sample of participants, our findings support the safety and potential use of acupuncture for RAI-induced anorexia and quality of life in thyroid cancer patients."
756,27338125,"To report on the cost-effectiveness of the Exercise for Health trial, comparing an exercise intervention with usual care during and following treatment for women with breast cancer.","Women with breast cancer were randomized to an 8-month exercise intervention (involving regular contact with an exercise physiologist over the phone, n\u00a0=\u00a067, or home delivered face to face, n\u00a0=\u00a067) or usual care (n\u00a0=\u00a060) group and were assessed pre-intervention (5\u00a0weeks post-surgery), mid-intervention (6 months post-surgery), and 10\u00a0weeks post-intervention (12\u00a0months post-surgery). The benefit measures were &quot;number of improvers&quot; in quality of life (FACT-B+4) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on provider, patient, and government costs were used to consider 2 cost scenarios: (1) a service provider model and (2) a private model.","There were 69 improvers in the intervention group compared with 21 in the usual care group (odds ratio 2.09, 95% confidence interval 1.08, 4.01; P\u00a0=\u00a0.033). The incremental cost per improver was A$2282 to A$2644. Quality-adjusted life years gain for the intervention group versus the usual care group was 0.009, with incremental cost per QALY gain for models 1 and 2 being A$105\u00a0231 and A$90\u00a0842, respectively. However, sensitivity analyses indicate that incremental cost per QALY gained was volatile to EuroQol-5D-3L weights.","Findings suggest that a pragmatic exercise intervention yields more women with markedly improved quality of life after breast cancer than usual care and may be cost-effective. The results are less certain in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years; however, this may be an inappropriate measure for reflecting exercise benefit for women with breast cancer."
757,16375040,"The incidence of skin cancer is rising in many populations around the world. In Australia, men have both the highest incidence of thick melanoma and an increased risk of dying from this disease. Skin screening may provide a method for detecting lesions at an earlier stage. This study sought to assess the impact of two methods of encouraging men to attend free open-access skin screening clinics.","A randomised controlled trial of two recruitment methods. Subjects comprised all men aged 30 to 79 years (n=1,322) from a rural community. We randomly allocated 50% (661) to receive a personalised letter with the remaining 50% receiving the letter plus an additional brochure.","Both groups were similar in age distribution. A total of 250 men (18.9%) attended the skin screening clinic. Overall, there was no difference in rates of attendance between the two groups. Younger men (30 to 49 years) in the letter and brochure group were more likely to attend a clinic, while men &gt; or =50 years in the letter only group were more likely to attend (p=0.01)",These results indicate that a personalised letter or targeted approach of invitation is effective in encouraging men to attend a skin screening clinic. The addition of health information through the use of a glossy brochure did not increase screening participation among men over 50.
758,15111338,It has been widely shown that the provision of adequate levels of information to patients does have a positive effect on quality of life by reducing anxiety and depression levels. The aim of this study was to show how Italian cancer patients rate the information they are given and whether the use of booklets and videotapes can improve their quality of life.,"Cancer patients aged between 18 and 80 years who were about to receive their first chemotherapy course were randomized to fill in questionnaires on perceived quality of information, level of psychological distress, perceived severity and curability of the disease, and quality of life. The results were evaluated by means of statistical analyses.","Out of 328 consecutive patients enrolled in 21 cancer centers, 86-93% considered the booklets either &quot;very useful&quot; or &quot;useful&quot;. The videotape was regarded as &quot;quite&quot; or &quot;much&quot; more complete than the booklets (87%). According to 81%/87% of patients, the information that had been given had improved their knowledge of the disease/chemotherapy either &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;enough&quot;.","The information patients receive from the oncologist was rated the highest, as long as they were devoted enough time. Booklets and videotapes can partially overcome the lack of oral information given by medical doctors. A better informed patient does help the oncologist save time."
759,15256294,"Women with breast cancer are at risk for elevated depression, anxiety, and decreased natural killer (NK) cell number. Stress has been linked to increased tumor development by decreasing NK cell activity. The objectives of this study included examining massage therapy for women with breast cancer for (1) improving mood and biological measures associated with mood enhancement (serotonin, dopamine), (2) reducing stress and stress hormone levels, and (3) boosting immune measures.","Thirty-four women (M age=53) diagnosed with Stage 1 or 2 breast cancer were randomly assigned postsurgery to a massage therapy group (to receive 30-min massages three times per week for 5 weeks) or a control group. The massage consisted of stroking, squeezing, and stretching techniques to the head, arms, legs/feet, and back. On the first and last day of the study, the women were assessed on (1) immediate effects measures of anxiety, depressed mood, and vigor and (2) longer term effects on depression, anxiety and hostility, functioning, body image, and avoidant versus intrusive coping style, in addition to urinary catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine) and serotonin levels. A subset of 27 women (n=15 massage) had blood drawn to assay immune measures.","The immediate massage therapy effects included reduced anxiety, depressed mood, and anger. The longer term massage effects included reduced depression and hostility and increased urinary dopamine, serotonin values, NK cell number, and lymphocytes.","Women with Stage 1 and 2 breast cancer may benefit from thrice-weekly massage therapy for reducing depressed mood, anxiety, and anger and for enhancing dopamine, serotonin, and NK cell number and lymphocytes."
760,14752074,To describe a randomized trial of a cognitive behavioral intervention on reducing symptom severity among patients diagnosed with solid tumors and undergoing a first course of chemotherapy and to determine whether the intervention had an additive or interactive effect on symptom severity in the presence of supportive care medications.,"Patients (N = 237) were accrued from comprehensive and community cancer centers, interviewed, and randomly assigned to either the experimental intervention (n = 118) or conventional care (n = 119). A symptom severity index, based on summed severity scores across 15 symptoms, was the primary outcome. Each patient's site of cancer, stage at diagnosis, chemotherapy protocols, and use of supportive medications were learned from medical records.","Groups were equivalent at baseline, and attrition by characteristics by group was not different. The proportion of patients not receiving chemotherapy at 10 and 20 weeks did not differ by group. At the 10- and 20-week observations, there was a significant interaction between the experimental group and baseline symptom severity. Patients in the experimental group who entered the trial with higher symptom severity reported significantly lower severity at 10 and 20 weeks. Controlling for chemotherapy treatment status at follow-up and supportive care medications did not alter the effect of the experimental intervention.","Compared with conventional care alone, the experimental intervention was effective among patients who entered the trial with higher levels of symptom severity. Age, sex, site or stage of cancer, and supportive medications did not modify the effect of this cognitive behavioral intervention on symptom severity."
761,18481713,To search for a safe and effective method for alleviating cancer pain.,"Sixty-six cases of late cancer with pain were first divided into 3 different degrees of pain, mild, moderate and severe, and then the patients with pain of each same degree were randomly divided into an acupuncture group treated by acupuncture at 3-5 of the most severe tender points, and a medication group treated with oral administration according to the WHO Three Step Administration Principle, i.e. the patients with mild pain took aspirin, moderate pain took codeine and severe pain took morphine.",Both two methods could effectively control cancer pain. The total effective rate of 94.1% in the acupuncture group was significantly better than 87.5% in the medication group (P&lt;0.05).,"The analgesic effect of acupuncture treatment is better than that of the Three Step Administration, with no adverse effect and addiction of analgesics."
762,27189616,"Evidence from randomized controlled trials is growing that exercise interventions are beneficial in cancer patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). However, information about adherence to exercise interventions and exercise contamination in control groups is lacking. This information is crucial for the interpretation of study results. We therefore examined the determinants of exercise adherence and contamination in different treatment periods during (inpatient) and after (outpatient) allo-HCT.",One hundred fifty-three patients scheduled for allo-HCT were randomized to a 1-year partly supervised exercise intervention (endurance and resistance exercise) or to a control group. Adherence was assessed via exercise logs and contamination via questionnaires.,"Adherence varied between 66\u00a0% (inpatient) and 78\u00a0% (outpatient) in different treatment periods. During (inpatient) transplantation period, higher adherence was significantly associated with lower fatigue (P\u2009=\u20090.004) and with having children at home (P\u2009=\u20090.049). Adherence after discharge was positively associated with endurance performance (P\u2009=\u20090.003); higher adherence after day 100 was associated with exercise activity prior allo-HCT (P\u2009=\u20090.010) and higher adherence after discharge (P\u2009=\u20090.001). Contamination among controls was high with 54\u00a0% and significantly associated with muscle strength (P\u2009=\u20090.025) and fatigue (P\u2009=\u20090.050).","Exercise adherence in different treatment periods was determined by different variables, and contamination among controls was evident. These findings may have important implications for correct interpretation of randomized exercise intervention trials."
763,15061863,To investigate whether primary care patients who claim to smoke tobacco gain greater benefit of a patient information leaflet (PIL) on oral cancer than nonsmokers.,"Two studies were conducted. Study 1 examined the research question initially, and Study 2 acted as a replication and inclusion of additional secondary outcome measures. The leaflet was designed and tested in an earlier study. Knowledge of oral cancer was assessed by a previously validated 36-dichotomous-item scale. A single-item question ascertained self-reported smoking status (kappa = 0.94). Study 1 participants were drawn from 14 practices (6 medical, 8 dental). A randomised control group design was adopted. The experimental group received the leaflet on attendance to the practice and then completed the questionnaire. The control group received the questionnaire only. Complete data were collected from 739 respondents. The design of Study 2 was identical; 786 new respondents from 16 practices (7 medical, 9 dental) were collected.","Both studies confirmed that smokers knew less about oral cancer than nonsmokers (P &lt; 0.05) when access to the leaflet had been denied. On receipt of the leaflet, there was no distinction in oral cancer knowledge between the smoking status categories of respondents. Evidence of reassurance about screening from leaflet exposure was supported by the second study.",This programmed research has demonstrated an effect of a brief PIL to offset the decrement in oral cancer knowledge observed in primary care patients who use tobacco in comparison to their nonsmoking counterparts. The leaflet reduced anxiety about oral health screening in smokers.
764,19194342,"The aim of this pilot double-blind, randomized clinical trial, which initially targeted breast cancer survivors, was to obtain preliminary evidence of the effect of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort extract) compared with placebo on symptoms and quality of life of symptomatic perimenopausal women. We also assessed practical difficulties in recruiting women to such a trial.","Symptomatic perimenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years who experience hot flashes (three or more per day, Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study scale) were randomly assigned to receive ethanolic St. John's wort extract (900 mg TID) or placebo. The women were asked to keep a daily diary during the week before randomization and during the week before the 3-month follow-up (primary outcome) to record hot flash frequency and intensity. A hot flash score (frequency x severity) was calculated. The Menopause-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire was used to assess menopause-specific quality of life.","Forty-seven women were randomized. After 12 weeks of treatment, a nonsignificant difference favoring the St. John's wort group was observed in the daily hot flash frequency (St. John's wort, -2.3 +/- 3.6; placebo, -1.0 +/- 2.2; P = 0.11) and the hot flash score (-3.8 +/- 8.3 and -1.8 +/- 6.5, respectively; P = 0.10). After 3 months of treatment, compared with the placebo group, women in the St. John's wort group reported significantly better menopause-specific quality of life (P = 0.01) and significantly fewer sleep problems (P = 0.05).","Hypericum perforatum may improve quality of life in ways that are important to symptomatic perimenopausal women, but these results need to be confirmed by a larger clinical trial."
765,29888608,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (CRT) in rectal cancer patients is associated with a reduction in physical capacity, lean mass and increased fatigue. As a countermeasure to these treatment-related adverse effects, we examined the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 10-week exercise program during CRT.","Ten rectal cancer patients (7 men, aged 27-70 years, body mass index = 26.4 \u00b1 3.8 kg/m) receiving CRT undertook supervised resistance and aerobic exercise twice weekly. Assessments were undertaken pre- and post-intervention for upper and lower body muscle strength by 1-RM, muscle endurance, physical performance tests, body composition by dual X-ray absorptiometry, quality of life, and fatigue.","There was a significant loss in appendicular skeletal muscle (-1.1 kg, P = .012), and fat mass (-0.8 kg, P = .029) following CRT. Despite the loss in skeletal muscle, leg press ( P = .030) and leg extension ( P = .046) strength improved by 27.2% and 22.7%, respectively, and leg press endurance by 76.7% ( P = .007). Changes in strength were accompanied by improved performance ( P &lt; .05) in 6-m fast walking speed (6.9%) and dynamic balance as determined by the 6-m backwards walk (15.5%). There was minimal change in quality of life and fatigue, and no adverse events related to training.",Exercise during neoadjuvant CRT appears to be feasible and well tolerated in rectal cancer patients and may enhance physical function while minimizing adverse changes in body composition and cancer-related fatigue. These initial findings need to be confirmed in randomized controlled trials.
766,28064386,"The purpose of this paper is to report the results of a negative randomized controlled trial, which piloted brief supportive-expressive therapy (SET) for partners of men with prostate cancer, and to discuss lessons learned for future clinical trials.","Partners of men with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic prostate cancer were randomized to SET (n\u00a0=\u00a045) or usual care (n\u00a0=\u00a032). SET involved six weekly group sessions emphasizing emotional expression, social support, and finding meaning in the cancer experience. Measures of mood disturbance, marital satisfaction, and social support were administered to both partners and patients at baseline, post-program, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.","There were no significant differences between SET and the control group for either patients or their wives on any outcome.

Methodological challenges experienced in implementing this trial yield valuable lessons for future research, including designing interventions relevant to unique problems faced by specific groups, being closely guided by previous research, and the potential utility of screening for distress as an inclusion criteria in intervention trials."
767,16831410,Oxidative stress is implicated in oral carcinogenesis and has been found to be aggravated during radiotherapy. A great deal of attention has been focused on the possible therapeutic implications of selenium as a potent antioxidant. We determined whether selenium supplementation to radiation treated oral cancer patients render improvement in the antioxidant status against oxidative stress.,"Blood samples were collected from stage (III) oral cancer patients before initiating radiotherapy (Group B) (n=63) and this group is bifurcated into Group C-patients given radiotherapy alone (n=27) and Group D-patients given radiotherapy and supplemented with selenium (400 mug/day for 6 months) (n=36). Both Group C and D were followed up for 6 months. We evaluated the plasma selenium concentration, non-enzymatic system including GSH, vitamins E, C, A and ceruloplasmin and enzymatic antioxidant system including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.","The concentrations of selenium, all non-enzymatic antioxidants and the activities of enzymatic antioxidants were found to be lowered in oral cancer patients (Group B), compared to normal (Group A) (p&lt;0.05). Similar decrease in the concentration of selenium and antioxidants status was observed in radiotherapy group (Group C) (p&lt;0.05). On the contrary, selenium group (Group D) showed marked increase in the concentrations of selenium and antioxidant status at 6 months compared to radiation group (Group C) (p&lt;0.05).",The observed result represents the antioxidant property of selenium through the improvement of antioxidant defense system.

Aerobic fitness, body composition, insulin sensitivity, and biomarkers were measured at 0, 6, and 24 months of intervention. PSA doubling time (PSADT) was calculated based on monthly PSA measurements.","Twenty-five patients were enrolled, and 19 patients completed the study. PSADT increased in the training group from 28 to 76 months (p &lt; 0.05) during the first 6 months and was correlated with changes in VO2max (p &lt; 0.01, r (2) = 0.41). The training group lost 3.6 \u00b1 1.0 kg (p &lt; 0.05) exclusively as fat mass, yet the changes in body composition were not associated with the increased PSADT.

774,28578704,"Like many other cancer patients, most pancreatic carcinoma patients suffer from severe weight loss. As shown in numerous studies with fish oil (FO) supplementation, a minimum daily intake of 1.5\u00a0g n-3-fatty acids (n-3-FA) contributes to weight stabilization and improvement of quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients. Given n-3-FA not as triglycerides (FO), but mainly bound to marine phospholipids (MPL), weight stabilization and improvement of QoL has already been seen at much lower doses of n-3-FA (0,3\u00a0g), and MPL were much better tolerated. The objective of this double-blind randomized controlled trial was to compare low dose MPL and FO formulations, which had the same n-3-FA amount and composition, on weight and appetite stabilization, global health enhancement (QoL), and plasma FA-profiles in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer.","Sixty pancreatic cancer patients were included into the study and randomized to take either FO- or MPL supplementation. Patients were treated with 0.3\u00a0g of n-3-fatty acids per day over six weeks. Since the n-3-FA content of FO is usually higher than that of MPL, FO was diluted with 40% of medium chain triglycerides (MCT) to achieve the same capsule size in both intervention groups and therefore assure blinding. Routine blood parameters, lipid profiles, body weight, and appetite were measured before and after intervention. Patient compliance was assessed through a patient diary. Quality of life and nutritional habits were assessed with validated questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ-C30, PAN26). Thirty one patients finalized the study protocol and were analyzed (per-protocol-analysis).","Intervention with low dose n-3-FAs, either as FO or MPL supplementation, resulted in similar and promising weight and appetite stabilization in pancreatic cancer patients. MPL capsules were slightly better tolerated and showed fewer side effects, when compared to FO supplementation.","The similar effects between both interventions were unexpected but reliable, since the MPL and FO formulations caused identical increases of n-3-FAs in plasma lipids of included patients after supplementation. The effects of FO with very low n-3-FA content might be explained by the addition of MCT. The results of this study suggest the need for further investigations of marine phospholipids for the improvement of QoL of cancer patients, optionally in combination with MCT."
775,17785709,"This study examines the impact of yoga, including physical poses, breathing, and meditation exercises, on quality of life (QOL), fatigue, distressed mood, and spiritual well-being among a multiethnic sample of breast cancer patients.","One hundred twenty-eight patients (42% African American, 31% Hispanic) recruited from an urban cancer center were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to a 12-week yoga intervention (n = 84) or a 12-week waitlist control group (n = 44). Changes in QOL (eg, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy) from before random assignment (T1) to the 3-month follow-up (T3) were examined; predictors of adherence were also assessed. Nearly half of all patients were receiving medical treatment.","Regression analyses indicated that the control group had a greater decrease in social well-being compared with the intervention group after controlling for baseline social well-being and covariates (P &lt; .0001). Secondary analyses of 71 patients not receiving chemotherapy during the intervention period indicated favorable outcomes for the intervention group compared with the control group in overall QOL (P &lt; .008), emotional well-being (P &lt; .015), social well-being (P &lt; .004), spiritual well-being (P &lt; .009), and distressed mood (P &lt; .031). Sixty-nine percent of intervention participants attended classes (mean number of classes attended by active class participants = 7.00 +/- 3.80), with lower adherence associated with increased fatigue (P &lt; .001), radiotherapy (P &lt; .0001), younger age (P &lt; .008), and no antiestrogen therapy (P &lt; .02).","Despite limited adherence, this intent-to-treat analysis suggests that yoga is associated with beneficial effects on social functioning among a medically diverse sample of breast cancer survivors. Among patients not receiving chemotherapy, yoga appears to enhance emotional well-being and mood and may serve to buffer deterioration in both overall and specific domains of QOL."
776,18061368,"Many existing models of health behavior advance perceived risk for disease as a key motivator of risk-reduction behavior. Thus evaluating contextual factors that may influence assessment of perceived risk is important. We examined (1) how mode of assessment (mail, telephone, web-based) and numeracy affect reported estimates of perceived risk of colon cancer, and (2) how the amount of missing perceived risk data differs as a function of mode of assessment and numeracy.","Women (N=457; mean age=61.3 years) with and without Internet access participated. Women without Internet access (n=233) were randomized into telephone or mail modes of assessment, and women with Internet access (n=224) were randomized into telephone, mail, or web-based modes of assessment. Numeracy and four different estimates of perceived lifetime risk for colon cancer (personal percentage, population percentage, comparative, binary) were assessed.","No significant differences were found in obtained risk estimates for any of the four risk perception items across the different modes of assessment. Greater numeracy was associated with lower percentage estimates of perceived risk. In general, the telephone mode of assessment yielded less missing data than the mail mode of assessment.","Mode of assessment largely does not matter when it comes to assessing perceived colon cancer risk. However, numeracy does matter and specifically impacts percentage estimates of perceived risk. While web-based, mail, and telephone modes may be used interchangeably when assessing perceived cancer risk; less missing data may result with telephone data collection."
777,15274068,"Advice to rest and take things easy if patients become fatigued during radiotherapy may be detrimental. Aerobic walking improves physical functioning and has been an intervention for chemotherapy-related fatigue. A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was performed to determine whether aerobic exercise would reduce the incidence of fatigue and prevent deterioration in physical functioning during radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma.","Sixty-six men were randomized before they received radical radiotherapy for localized prostate carcinoma, with 33 men randomized to an exercise group and 33 men randomized to a control group. Outcome measures were fatigue and distance walked in a modified shuttle test before and after radiotherapy.","There were no significant between group differences noted with regard to fatigue scores at baseline (P = 0.55) or after 4 weeks of radiotherapy (P = 0.18). Men in the control group had significant increases in fatigue scores from baseline to the end of radiotherapy (P = 0.013), with no significant increases observed in the exercise group (P = 0.203). A nonsignificant reduction (2.4%) in shuttle test distance at the end of radiotherapy was observed in the control group; however, in the exercise group, there was a significant increase (13.2%) in distance walked (P = 0.0003).","Men who followed advice to rest and take things easy if they became fatigued demonstrated a slight deterioration in physical functioning and a significant increase in fatigue at the end of radiotherapy. Home-based, moderate-intensity walking produced a significant improvement in physical functioning with no significant increase in fatigue. Improved physical functioning may be necessary to combat radiation fatigue."
778,9586828,"Dietary calcium and antioxidants have been suggested as protective agents against colorectal cancer. This has been supported by animal experimental studies, case control and cohort studies.","In a prospective intervention study of colorectal adenomas, and intermediary stage in colorectal carcinogenesis, 116 polyp-bearing patients received a placebo-controlled daily mixture of beta-carotene 15 mg, vitamin C 150 mg, vitamin E 75 mg, selenium 101 microg, and calcium (1.6 g daily) as carbonate for a period of 3 years with annual colonoscopic follow-up to test if the mixture was able to reduce polyp growth or recurrence. All polyps of &lt; 10 mm at enrollment or follow-up were left unresected until the end of the study.","87-91% of the patients attended the annual endoscopic follow-up investigations, and 19% of the patients dropped out of the medical intervention. The rest consumed 85% of the total amount of tablets over the 3 years. The fecal calcium concentration was 2.3-2.7 times higher in patients taking active medication compared to the placebo group. Diet registration showed that, when adding the intake of antioxidants and calcium from diet and intervention, there was a significant difference between the intake of these substances in the active and the placebo group. No difference was detected in the growth of adenomas between the active and the placebo group from year to year and for the total study period. Moreover, there was no effect on polyps of &lt; 5 or 5-9 mm, or on polyps in the different colonic segments analyzed separately. A reduced growth of adenomas was found in patients &lt;60 years of age taking active medication (n = 8) compared to those taking placebo (n = 6; mean difference 2.3 mm; 95% CI 0.26-4.36). There was a significantly lower number of patients free of new adenomas in the placebo group compared to those taking active medication as tested by logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test p value 0.035). Subgroup analysis showed that only the group of patients with no family history of colorectal cancer, those with only one adenoma at inclusion, and those &lt;65 years benefitted from the intervention medication.","The study did not find an overall effect on polyp growth. Our data, however, may support a protective role of calcium and antioxidants on new adenoma formation."

However, no interventions have been specifically directed to staff at outdoor swimming pool sites.",We conducted a randomized controlled trial among aquatic staff at 28 outdoor pool sites in Hawaii and Massachusetts. Intervention pools received sun protection education and control pools received education on child injury prevention. Staff in both arms received orientation sessions and led instruction during swim lessons. Analysis of covariance was used to compare and test for changes in outcome variables (sun protection habits and sunburning rates of aquatic staff) and pool protection policies. Surveys were completed at the beginning and end of the summer.,"Surveys were completed by 220 aquatics staff at baseline; 194 surveys were completed at posttest. Compared with staff at control pools, sun protection policies (P &lt; 0.04) and sunburning rates (P &lt; 0.05) improved at sun protection pools from baseline to posttest. However, the difference in the mean score of all sun protection habits between the two study groups was nonsignificant.",The Pool Cool sun protection intervention had significant effects on lifeguards' sunburn rates and pool sun safety policies but did not improve reported sun protection behaviors. More intensive strategies may be needed to influence aquatics workers who have already begun to adopt skin cancer prevention practices.

786,30415637,Higher intake of marine n-3 (also called omega-3) fatty acids has been associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer in several observational studies. Whether supplementation with n-3 fatty acids has such effects in general populations at usual risk for these end points is unclear.,"We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, with a two-by-two factorial design, of vitamin D (at a dose of 2000 IU per day) and marine n-3 fatty acids (at a dose of 1 g per day) in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among men 50 years of age or older and women 55 years of age or older in the United States. Primary end points were major cardiovascular events (a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes) and invasive cancer of any type. Secondary end points included individual components of the composite cardiovascular end point, the composite end point plus coronary revascularization (expanded composite of cardiovascular events), site-specific cancers, and death from cancer. Safety was also assessed. This article reports the results of the comparison of n-3 fatty acids with placebo.","A total of 25,871 participants, including 5106 black participants, underwent randomization.

Primary MM cells from 11 patients were tested for B-inducible NF-\u03baB activation.","Seventy-six percent of subjects were refractory to previous treatment, 39% refractory to bortezomib. Median cycles received were 5. CR + PR for the entire group were 53% and did not differ between groups. Incidence of \u22653 PN was 32% in the BDD group versus 15 % in the BDD-A group (p = ns). Patient-reported fatigue and PN measured by FACT-GOG-TX increased throughout the treatment period in the BDD-A group, although time to complete GP testing declined. In a sub-study examining constitutive bortezomib-inducible NF-\u03baB activity in primary subject-specific MM cells, the presence of NF-\u03baB activation correlated with lower likelihood of response.",Addition of ALCAR to BDD did not alter the incidence or severity of PN in relapsed MM patients receiving a B-based regimen. Bortezomib-inducible NF-\u03baB activation in patient-derived primary MM cells may be associated with poorer response.

793,17227997,Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Histopathologic studies have identified a sequence of changes in the gastric mucosa that mark the slow progression from normal tissue to carcinoma. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables could be a protective factor against this disease. This effect may be mediated through antioxidant vitamins.,"A randomized, double-blind chemoprevention trial was conducted among 1980 subjects in Tachira State, Venezuela (whose population is at high risk for gastric cancer), to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene on the progression and regression of precancerous gastric lesions. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of vitamin C (750 mg/day), vitamin E (600 mg/day), and beta-carotene (18 mg/day) or placebo for 3 years. Changes in the gastric mucosa were determined by histologic diagnosis based on five biopsies taken from prespecified areas of the stomach at baseline and annually for 3 years. All biopsies were reviewed by a single expert pathologist. Progression rates (and regression rates) were calculated by comparing the first and last available gastroscopies for each subject and dividing the number of subjects whose diagnoses increased (decreased) in severity by the total follow-up time. Overall rate ratios were calculated by Poisson regression, controlling for baseline diagnosis. All statistical tests were two-sided.","Median plasma vitamin levels were increased in the treatment group between baseline and 1 year after randomization from 0.43 micromol/L (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.26-0.69) to 2.89 micromol/L (IQR = 1.76-4.22) for beta-carotene, from 26.7 micromol/L (IQR = 23.1-31.2) to 54.9 micromol/L (IQR = 42.8-67.6) for alpha-tocopherol, and from 47.70 micromol/L (IQR = 36.9-58.5) to 61.9 micromol/L (IQR = 52.2-72.7) for vitamin C. Overall progression rates per 100 person-years were 74.3 in the placebo group and 67.8 in the group randomly assigned to vitamins. Overall regression rates were 109.4 in the placebo group and 116.5 in the group randomly assigned to vitamins. There was no statistically significant difference in progression rate (rate ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 1.15) or regression rate (rate ratio = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.90 to 1.33) between vitamin and placebo groups.",Supplementation with antioxidant micronutrients is not an effective tool for gastric cancer control in this high-risk population. The results of this trial are consistent with previous findings on the lack of effect of nutritional supplementation on precancerous gastric lesions.

796,22099039,"To investigate whether magnesium oxide during external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer reduces intrafraction prostate motion in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial.","At the Department of Radiotherapy, prostate cancer patients scheduled for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (77 Gy in 35 fractions) using fiducial marker-based position verification were randomly assigned to receive magnesium oxide (500 mg twice a day) or placebo during radiotherapy. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with clinically relevant intrafraction prostate motion, defined as the proportion of patients who demonstrated in \u2265 50% of the fractions an intrafraction motion outside a range of 2 mm. Secondary outcome measures included quality of life and acute toxicity.","In total, 46 patients per treatment arm were enrolled. The primary endpoint did not show a statistically significant difference between the treatment arms with a percentage of patients with clinically relevant intrafraction motion of 83% in the magnesium oxide arm as compared with 80% in the placebo arm (p = 1.00). Concerning the secondary endpoints, exploratory analyses demonstrated a trend towards worsened quality of life and slightly more toxicity in the magnesium oxide arm than in the placebo arm; however, these differences were not statistically significant.","Magnesium oxide is not effective in reducing the intrafraction prostate motion during external-beam radiotherapy, and therefore there is no indication to use it in clinical practice for this purpose."
797,25918291,"We evaluated the effectiveness of a low-intensity, home-based physical activity program (Onco-Move) and a moderate- to high-intensity, combined supervised resistance and aerobic exercise program (OnTrack) versus usual care (UC) in maintaining or enhancing physical fitness, minimizing fatigue, enhancing health-related quality of life, and optimizing chemotherapy completion rates in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.","We randomly assigned patients who were scheduled to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy (N = 230) to Onco-Move, OnTrack, or UC. Performance-based and self-reported outcomes were assessed before random assignment, at the end of chemotherapy, and at the 6-month follow-up. We used generalized estimating equations to compare the groups over time.","Onco-Move and OnTrack resulted in less decline in cardiorespiratory fitness (P &lt; .001), better physical functioning (P \u2264 .001), less nausea and vomiting (P = .029 and .031, respectively) and less pain (P = .003 and .011, respectively) compared with UC. OnTrack also resulted in better outcomes for muscle strength (P = .002) and physical fatigue (P &lt; .001). At the 6-month follow-up, most outcomes returned to baseline levels for all three groups. A smaller percentage of participants in OnTrack required chemotherapy dose adjustments than those in the UC or Onco-Move groups (P = .002). Both intervention groups returned earlier (P = .012), as well as for more hours per week (P = .014), to work than the control group.","A supervised, moderate- to high-intensity, combined resistance and aerobic exercise program is most effective for patients with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. A home-based, low-intensity physical activity program represents a viable alternative for women who are unable or unwilling to follow the higher intensity program."
798,15022300,The efficacy of energy conservation and activity management (ECAM) for fatigue reduction and maintenance of functional performance has never been evaluated in adults with cancer who are undergoing treatment.,"A randomized clinical trial compared an ECAM intervention with a control intervention focused on nutrition. Individuals initiating chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or concurrent therapy for cancer were randomized to receive either the semistructured ECAM intervention (n = 200) or the control intervention (n = 196). Participants in each group participated in 3 telephone sessions with an oncology nurse during the first 5 weeks of treatment. Data on fatigue and limitation of functioning were obtained before cancer treatment and at two follow-up points that coincided with times of high fatigue for each type of treatment. The outcomes of interest included perception of fatigue and functional performance.","A repeated-measures analysis of covariance using the type of cancer treatment as a covariate revealed a significant study group-by-time interaction indicating that the ECAM group experienced a greater decrease in fatigue over time compared with the control group (F(2,544) = 4.5; P = 0.01). The intervention was not associated with changes in overall functional performance.","Individuals who received the ECAM intervention derived a modest but significant benefit from it. To achieve a more robust clinical benefit from the intervention, it may be necessary to manage other key symptoms in addition to fatigue. Research is needed to examine symptom clusters or combinations associated with negative outcomes as well as combination strategies for symptom management."

However, a definite conclusion on whether it can improve patients' survival has not yet been reached. The present study aimed to test possibilities of improving survival of patients with decompensated cirrhosis by using a BCAA preparation that is suitable for long-term oral administration.","A multicenter, randomized, and nutrient intake-controlled trial on the comparative effects of BCAA orally administered at 12 g/day for 2 years versus diet therapy with defined daily food intake (1.0-1.4 g protein kg(-1) day(-1) including BCAA preparation and 25-35 kcal kg(-1) day(-1)) was conducted in 646 patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The primary end point was a composite of death by any cause, development of liver cancer, rupture of esophageal varices, or progress of hepatic failure (event-free survival). The secondary end points were serum albumin concentration and health-related quality of life (QOL) measured by Short Form-36 questionnaire.","The incidence of events comprising the primary end point significantly decreased in the BCAA group as compared with the diet group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.93; P = .015; median observation period, 445 days). Serum albumin concentration increased significantly in the BCAA group as compared with the diet group (P = .018). The &quot;general health perception&quot; domain in Short Form-36 measures was also improved (P = .003). Patients' adherence to the prescription was favorable.","Oral supplementation with a BCAA preparation that can be administered for a long period improves event-free survival, serum albumin concentration, and QOL in patients with decompensated cirrhosis with an adequate daily food intake."

And 21 days consisted of 1 therapeutic course, 4 courses in total. All of them underwent CTP of primary tumor and routine thoracic CT examination (plain CT and enhancement CT) 3 times (before therapy, after 2 and 4 cycles). CT findings were analyzed for tumor size and perfusion parameters [blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), permeability surface (PS), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TP) before and after treatment, and relationship between perfusion parameters and prognosis was also assessed.","In 87 cases, 7 dropped out and 80 cases were available, 40 in the treatment group and 40 in the control group. (1) The relief rate was 47.5% (19/40) and the total stable rate was 77.5% (31/40) in the treatment group, and they were 40.0% (16/40) and 65.0% (26/40) in the control group, with no statistical difference between the two groups (\u03c7\u00b2 = 0.672, 1.227; P &gt; 0.05).

802,11170129,alpha-tocopherol supplementation significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer in the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. Sex hormones are thought to be involved in the etiology of prostate cancer. We examined whether long-term supplementation with alpha-tocopherol modified serum hormone levels.,"Men who were cancer-free consumed &gt; or = 90% of the study capsules, and who had both baseline and follow-up blood available, were eligible for the study. One hundred men who received alpha-tocopherol were matched on age, study center, and length of time between blood draws to 100 men who received a placebo. Multivariate linear regression models which allowed for a separate intercept for each matched pair were used to evaluate the effect of alpha-tocopherol supplementation on follow-up hormone concentrations.","Compared to men who received a placebo, we found significantly lower serum androstenedione (P = 0.04) and testosterone (P = 0.04) concentrations among men who received alpha-tocopherol, after controlling for baseline hormone level, follow-up serum cholesterol concentration, body mass index, smoking, and fasting time. Geometric mean (95% confidence interval; CI) androstenedione concentration among men who received alpha-tocopherol was 145 ng/dl (CI, 137-153) after adjusting for covariates, compared to 158 ng/dl (CI, 148-167) among men who received a placebo. Mean testosterone concentrations for men who received alpha-tocopherol and placebo were 539 (CI, 517-562) and 573 (CI, 549-598) ng/dl, respectively.","These results suggest that long-term alpha-tocopherol supplementation decreases serum androgen concentrations, and could have been one of the factors contributing to the observed reduction in incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in the alpha-tocopherol treatment group of the ATBC Study."

Subjects were randomly allocated to receive individually tailored or standardized mammography recommendation letters mailed from physicians to patients' homes. Follow-up interviews were conducted 8 months later.","Tailored letter recipients were more likely to remember and to have read more of their letters than standardized version recipients. After controlling for baseline status, tailored letter receipt was associated with more favorable follow-up mammography status for women with incomes below $26,000 and for Black women.",Tailored messages are a more effective medium for physicians' mammography recommendations; tailoring may be especially important for women of low socioeconomic status.
804,26231554,We examined whether an intervention combining pelvic floor muscle exercise and symptom self-management would improve urinary continence and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer.,"In a randomized, controlled, longitudinal clinical trial 279 patients with prostate cancer with persistent urinary incontinence were randomized to 1 of 3 groups, including biofeedback pelvic floor muscle exercise plus a support group, the biofeedback exercise plus telephone contact and usual care without intervention. The biofeedback plus support and plus telephone groups received 1 session of biofeedback assisted exercise and 6 biweekly sessions of problem solving therapy. This delivered symptom management skills through a peer support group or telephone contacts for 3 months. All subjects were assessed in blinded fashion at baseline, and 3 and 6 months for urinary leakage frequency, leakage amount and disease specific quality of life.","A total of 244 subjects completed the study. The biofeedback plus support and biofeedback plus telephone groups had a lower frequency of daily urinary leakage than the group with usual care without intervention at 3 months (p=0.019 and p\u22640.001, respectively) but not at 6 months. The biofeedback plus support group but not the biofeedback plus telephone group had 13.3 gm lower leakage at 6 months than the usual care group (p=0.003). Overall the biofeedback plus support and plus telephone groups reported less symptom severity (p\u22640.001) and fewer incontinence problems (p\u22640.01) than the usual care group at 6 months.",Study findings show that pelvic floor muscle exercise practice plus symptom self-management in a peer support setting can significantly improve urinary continence and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer.
805,16416368,"Patients with cancer are characterized by a profound impairment of glucose utilization, with lipids being the preferred metabolic fuel. In contrast, the energy needs of malignant tumors are almost entirely met by glucose. We therefore studied the effects of a high-fat diet, particularly on body composition.","Twenty-three moderately malnourished patients with gastrointestinal carcinomas were randomized to receive either a conventional diet supplying 35 nonprotein kcal and 1.1 g of protein/kg per day (group A, n = 11) or a fat-enriched artificial liquid diet (20 nonprotein kcal/kg per day) plus normal meals (group B, n = 12) for a period of eight weeks, i.e., from the first to the third chemotherapy cycle. The fat content of the artificial diet was 66% of the nonprotein calories. The day before the nutritional interventions, and again after four and eight weeks, body compartments were determined using bioelectrical impedance analysis, lymphocyte subpopulations were quantified using flow cytometry, and some aspects of the quality of life were rated using four linear analog self-assessment (LASA) scales. The statistical calculations were done as an exploratory data analysis.","The consumption of non-protein calories did not differ significantly between the two patient groups. An average weight gain in group B contrasted with an average weight loss in group A after four (P &lt; 0.01) and eight weeks (P &lt; 0.05). Fat-free mass showed an intergroup difference in favor of group B after eight weeks (P &lt; 0.05). Body cell mass was maintained throughout the study in group B, but declined significantly up to weeks 4 and 8 in group A (intergroup difference: P &lt; 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). A decrease in the total lymphocyte count by 559 cells/mul occurred with the fat-enriched diet (P &lt; 0.05). Several aspects of the quality of life were rated to be better in group B than in group A, although not all differences reached statistical significance.","In patients with cancer, a high-fat diet may possibly support the maintenance of both body weight and body cell mass. However, monitoring the lymphocyte count is advisable."
806,16765428,"Promoting public awareness of cancer risk factors is an important public health goal, but there is concern that it could heighten anxiety. This study examined the impact of mailed information about colorectal cancer on awareness of risk factors, emotional well-being, and interest in attending screening in a population not previously exposed to screening.","Individuals (3,185) aged 45-66 years registered with general practitioners in South-West England in 2004 were randomized to (1) control group (no information), (2) information on colorectal cancer risk factors, or (3) information on risk factors and colorectal screening. All participants were sent a questionnaire assessing knowledge, anxiety, worry about colorectal cancer, and interest in screening.","Questionnaires (1,945; 61%) were returned. As expected, participants receiving information had significantly greater knowledge than the control group. Anxiety scores were in the normal range and neither anxiety nor worry about cancer differed significantly between the groups.

Body composition, dietary intake and quality of life were measured at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks.","On average, there were significant differences in energy intake (501 kcal), protein intake (25.4 g) and weight (1.7 kg) between patients who were compliant with the nutrition prescription compared to noncompliant patients controlling for n-3 fatty acid randomisation, baseline weight and quality of life. Over the 8-week period, there was significant improvement in weight only. There was no significant difference in the energy intake from meals of the total group over the 8 weeks.","Compliance with the prescription of 1.5 cans of a protein and energy dense, oral nutrition supplement +/-n-3 fatty acids improved nutrition related outcomes in untreated pancreatic cancer patients. This level of supplement intake does not inhibit meal intake."
814,17290062,To test the effectiveness of supplementing usual supportive care with aromatherapy massage in the management of anxiety and depression in cancer patients through a pragmatic two-arm randomized controlled trial in four United Kingdom cancer centers and a hospice.,"Two hundred eighty-eight cancer patients, referred to complementary therapy services with clinical anxiety and/or depression, were allocated randomly to a course of aromatherapy massage or usual supportive care alone.","Patients who received aromatherapy massage had no significant improvement in clinical anxiety and/or depression compared with those receiving usual care at 10 weeks postrandomization (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.7; P = .1), but did at 6 weeks postrandomization (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9; P = .01). Patients receiving aromatherapy massage also described greater improvement in self-reported anxiety at both 6 and 10 weeks postrandomization (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 6.7; P = .04 and OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 6.6; P = .04), respectively.","Aromatherapy massage does not appear to confer benefit on cancer patients' anxiety and/or depression in the long-term, but is associated with clinically important benefit up to 2 weeks after the intervention."
815,17376044,"Despite the progression of therapeutic approaches, a high frequency of recurrence is what determines the long-term prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the chemopreventive effects of vitamin K2 on the recurrence and survival of patients with HCC after curative therapy were evaluated.",Sixty patients who were diagnosed to be free of HCC after radiofrequency ablation therapy or surgery were randomly assigned to either the vitamin K2 group (n = 30 patients) or the control group (n = 30 patients). All patients were positive for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen positive patients were excluded from this study. Patients in the vitamin K2 group received an oral dose of menatetrenone at 45 mg per day. Disease recurrence and the survival rates were analyzed in patients with HCC.,"The cumulative recurrence-free rates in the vitamin K2 group were 92.3% at 12 months, 48.6% at 24 months and 38.8% at 36 months; and those in the control group were 71.7%, 35.9% and 9.9%, respectively (P = 0.045). The cumulative survival rates in the vitamin K2 group were 100% at 12 months, 95.0% at 24 months and 77.5% at 36 months; and those in the control group were 95.8%, 90.2% and 66.4%, respectively (P = 0.70).","Vitamin K2 may have a suppressive effect on the recurrence of HCC and a beneficial effect on tumor recurrence. However, there was no significant difference in the survival rates. The chemopreventive effects of vitamin K2 are not sufficient. The development of a further regimen such as combination therapy is required."
816,18286527,Onycholysis occurs in approximately 30% of patients treated with docetaxel. The efficacy and safety of an Elasto-Gel frozen sock (FS) was investigated for the prevention of docetaxel-induced nail and skin toxicity of the feet.,Patients receiving docetaxel at a dose of 70 to 100 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks were eligible for this matched case-control study. Each patient wore an FS for 90 minutes on the right foot. The unprotected left foot acted as control. Nail and skin toxicities were assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3) and compared using a 2-sample Wilcoxon matched-pairs rank test adjusted for tied values.,"Fifty consecutive patients were included between April 2005 and January 2007. Nail toxicity was significantly lower in the FS-protected foot compared with the control foot (grade 0: 100% versus 79%; and grade 1 and 2: 0% versus 21%, respectively) (P= .002). Skin toxicity was grade 0: 98% versus 94%; and grade 1 and 2: 2% versus 6% in the FS-protected and the control feet, respectively. The median times until toxicity occurrence were not found to differ significantly between the groups. One patient experienced discomfort because of cold intolerance.","Cold therapy using FS significantly reduced the incidence of docetaxel-induced foot nail toxicity, as previously demonstrated using frozen gloves for the hands."
817,22293042,The goal of this study was to evaluate a mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral intervention for sexual dysfunction in gynecologic cancer survivors compared to a wait-list control group.,"Thirty-one survivors of endometrial or cervical cancer (mean age 54.0, range 31-64) who self-reported significant and distressing sexual desire and/or sexual arousal concerns were assigned either to three, 90-minute mindfulness-based cognitive behavior therapy sessions or two months of wait-list control prior to entering the treatment arm. Validated measures of sexual response, sexual distress, and mood, as well as laboratory-evoked physiological and subjective sexual arousal were assessed at pre-, one month post-, and 6-months following treatment.","There were no significant effects of the wait-list condition on any measure. Treatment led to significant improvements in all domains of sexual response, and a trend towards significance for reducing sexual distress. Perception of genital arousal during an erotic film was also significantly increased following the intervention despite no change in physiologically-measured sexual arousal.","A brief mindfulness-based intervention was effective for improving sexual functioning. Geographic restrictions permitted only a select sample of survivors to participate, thus, the generalizability of the findings is limited. Future studies should aim to develop online modalities for treatment administration to overcome this limitation."
818,16519641,"Postoperative ileus is common after colorectal resection and can prolong hospital stay. Gum chewing, a type of sham feeding, may to stimulate gut motility via cephalic-vagal stimulation, and thereby reduce the length of ileus. This study aimed to determine whether gum chewing in the immediate postoperative period facilitated recovery from ileus following resection for left-sided colorectal cancer.","In a prospective randomized control trial, 38 patients undergoing open surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer were allocated to standard postoperative care (control group, n = 19) or to standard postoperative care plus the immediate use of chewing gum (treatment group, n = 19).","Control patients passed flatus by mean of 2.7 days (SD 1.0) and faeces by 3.9 days (SD 1.5); for the treatment group, this was 2.4 days (SD 1.0) and 3.2 days (SD 1.5) respectively, (NS, P = 0.56 and P = 0.38). Length of hospital stay was 11.1 days (SD 7.3) in control group and 9.4 days (SD 2.5) in the treatment group (NS, P = 0.75).",The addition of gum chewing to a standardized postoperative regimen did not reduce the period of postoperative ileus or shorten length of stay following open surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer.
819,11020090,The objective of this study was to assess the effects of participation in a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction program on mood disturbance and symptoms of stress in cancer outpatients.,"A randomized, wait-list controlled design was used. A convenience sample of eligible cancer patients enrolled after giving informed consent and were randomly assigned to either an immediate treatment condition or a wait-list control condition. Patients completed the Profile of Mood States and the Symptoms of Stress Inventory both before and after the intervention. The intervention consisted of a weekly meditation group lasting 1.5 hours for 7 weeks plus home meditation practice.","Ninety patients (mean age, 51 years) completed the study. The group was heterogeneous in type and stage of cancer. Patients' mean preintervention scores on dependent measures were equivalent between groups. After the intervention, patients in the treatment group had significantly lower scores on Total Mood Disturbance and subscales of Depression, Anxiety, Anger, and Confusion and more Vigor than control subjects. The treatment group also had fewer overall Symptoms of Stress; fewer Cardiopulmonary and Gastrointestinal symptoms; less Emotional Irritability, Depression, and Cognitive Disorganization; and fewer Habitual Patterns of stress. Overall reduction in Total Mood Disturbance was 65%, with a 31% reduction in Symptoms of Stress.","This program was effective in decreasing mood disturbance and stress symptoms in both male and female patients with a wide variety of cancer diagnoses, stages of illness, and ages. cancer, stress, mood, intervention, mindfulness."
820,15774238,"To assess the effect of a nutritional supplement containing vitamin E, selenium, vitamin C and coenzyme Q10 on changes in serum levels of PSA in patients with hormonally untreated carcinoma of the prostate and rising serum PSA levels.","Eighty patients were randomised to receive a daily supplement with either vitamin E, selenium, vitamin C, coenzyme Q10 (intervention group) or placebo over 21 weeks. Serum levels of PSA were assessed at baseline (-2, -1, 0 weeks) and after 6, 13, 19, 20 and 21 weeks. Mean changes in log serum level of PSA, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, luteinizing hormone and sex hormone binding globulin over 21 weeks between the verum and the placebo group were compared by analysis of covariance.","Seventy patients completed the study (36 verum; 34 placebo). Compliance was &gt;90% in all patients. In the intervention group, plasma levels of vitamin E, selenium and coenzyme Q10 increased significantly over the 21 weeks study period. No significant differences in serum levels of PSA, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, luteinizing hormone or sex hormone binding globulin (p&gt;0.2) were observed between the intervention and control group.","Our results indicate that supplementation of a combination of vitamin E, selenium, vitamin C and coenzyme-Q10 does not affect serum level of PSA or hormone levels in patients with hormonally untreated carcinoma of the prostate."
821,11598430,": Previous studies of cancer patients investigated the effect of psychological treatment on basal endocrine and immune values. Using a randomized experiment, we explored the effect of a 13-week experiential-existential group psychotherapy (EEGP) program on the reactivity to a speech task in breast cancer patients. We explored whether changes in cardiovascular and immune reactivity to a speech task over the 3-month period correlated with changes in psychological distress and emotional expression.","Patients who had been treated for early-stage breast cancer and who were diagnosed as having either positive axillary lymph nodes or distant metastases were randomly assigned to either EEGP or a waiting list control (WLC) condition. We continuously recorded heart rate (HR), diastolic (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in response to the speech task before and after treatment. We also measured lymphocyte proliferation to pokeweed (PWM) and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), and natural killer cell activity (NKCA) as well as peripheral blood lymphocyte distributions in blood samples that were drawn before, during and after the speech task.","Patients in EEGP had smaller increases in natural killer (NK) cells induced by the speech task after treatment versus task-induced values observed at study entry and greater than pre-/posttreatment changes seen in patients randomized to the WLC. A similar pattern emerged with respect to NKCA over the intervention period, which was independent of the changes in NK cells. There were no differences between patients assigned to EEGP and WLC in HR, DBP and SBP responses as well as in changes in PWM- and PHA-induced lymphocyte proliferation in response to the speech task measured before and after the 3-month intervention period. Individual differences in pre-/posttreatment increases in emotional expression but not in psychological distress were significantly associated with smaller changes in the number and function of NK cells over the 3-month period.","These findings may indicate that emotional expression during EEGP may render breast cancer patients more comfortable expressing their emotional responses to the speech challenge, which, in turn, results in smaller stress-induced changes in NK cells and function."
822,30159789,"Although aromatase inhibitors (AIs) prolong survival in post-menopausal breast cancer (BC) patients, AI-associated arthralgia can lead to discontinuation. Obese patients have higher rates of AI arthralgia than non-obese patients, but treatment options are limited. Omega-3 fatty acid (O3-FA) treatment for AI arthralgia has produced mixed results.","We performed an exploratory analysis of SWOG S0927, a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of O3-FA use for AI arthralgia. Post-menopausal women with stage I-III BC taking an AI were randomized to 24 weeks of O3-FAs or placebo. Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaires and fasting serum were collected at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks. The BPI assessment included worst pain, average pain, and pain interference scores (range 0-10).","Among the 249 participants, 139 had BMI\u2009&lt;\u200930\u00a0kg/m (56%) and 110 had BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0kg/m (44%).

Similarly, O3-FA use was associated with lower BPI average pain and pain interference scores at 24 weeks compared with placebo among obese patients, but no significant difference between treatment arms in non-obese patients (interaction p\u2009=\u20090.005 and p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively).","In obese BC patients, O3-FA use was associated with significantly reduced AI arthralgia compared to placebo."
823,15337807,"This randomized clinical trial tests the hypothesis that a psychological intervention can reduce emotional distress, improve health behaviors and dose-intensity, and enhance immune responses.","We studied 227 women who were surgically treated for regional breast cancer. Before adjuvant therapy, women completed interviews and questionnaires assessing emotional distress, social adjustment, and health behaviors. A 60-mL blood sample was drawn for immune assays. Patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or assessment only group. The intervention was conducted in small patient groups, with one session per week for 4 months. The sessions included strategies to reduce stress, improve mood, alter health behaviors, and maintain adherence to cancer treatment and care. Reassessment occurred after completion of the intervention.","As predicted, patients receiving the intervention showed significant lowering of anxiety, improvements in perceived social support, improved dietary habits, and reduction in smoking (all P &lt;.05). Analyses of adjuvant chemotherapy dose-intensity revealed significantly more variability (ie, more dispersion in the dose-intensity values) for the assessment arm (P &lt;.05). Immune responses for the intervention patients paralleled their psychological and behavioral improvements. T-cell proliferation in response to phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A remained stable or increased for the Intervention patients, whereas both responses declined for Assessment patients; this effect was replicated across three concentrations for each assay (all P &lt;.01).","These data show a convergence of significant psychological, health behavior, and biologic effects after a psychological intervention for cancer patients."
824,28872752,"To explore if duration of previous exposure to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer (PCa) undertaking a year-long exercise programme moderates the exercise response with regard to body composition and muscle performance, and also to explore the moderator effects of baseline testosterone, time since ADT, and baseline value of the outcome.","In a multicentre randomized controlled trial, 100 men who had previously undergone either 6 months (short-term) or 18 months (long-term) of ADT in combination with radiotherapy, as part of the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial, were randomized to 6 months supervised exercise, followed by a 6-month home-based maintenance programme, or to printed physical activity educational material for 12 months across 13 university-affiliated exercise clinics in Australia and New Zealand. The participants were long-term survivors of PCa with a mean age of 71.7 \u00b1 6.4 years, and were assessed for lower extremity performance (repeated chair rise), with a subset of men (n = 57) undergoing additional measures for upper and lower body muscle strength and body composition (lean mass, fat mass, appendicular skeletal muscle [ASM]) by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Data were analysed using generalized estimating equations.","Time on ADT significantly moderated the exercise effects on chair rise (\u03b2 = -1.3 s, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.6 to 0.0), whole-body lean mass (\u03b2 = 1194 g, 95% CI 234 to 2153) and ASM mass (\u03b2 = 562 g, 95% CI 49 to 1075), and approached significance for fat mass (\u03b2 = -1107 g, 95% CI -2346 to 132), with greater benefits for men previously on long-term ADT. At 6 months, the intervention effects on chair rise time -1.5 s (95% CI -2.5 to -0.5), whole-body lean mass 824 g (95% CI 8 to 1640), ASM mass 709 g (95% CI 260 to 1158), and fat mass -1377 g (95% CI -2156 to -598) were significant for men previously on long-term ADT, but not for men on short-term ADT. At 12 months, the intervention effects for men on long-term ADT remained significant for the chair rise, with improved performance (-2.0 s, 95% CI -3.0 to -1.0) and increased ASM (537 g, 95% CI 153 to 921). Time on ADT did not moderate the exercise effects on muscle strength, nor did time since ADT cessation moderate any intervention effects. Similarly, testosterone and baseline values of the outcome had negligible moderator effects.","Men with PCa previously treated long-term with ADT respond more favourably to exercise in terms of lower body muscle performance and body composition (lean and fat mass, and ASM) than those with short-term ADT exposure. As a result, men who were formerly on long-term androgen suppression regimens should be especially prescribed exercise medicine interventions to alleviate residual treatment-related adverse effects."
825,16114063,"Phytoestrogens have been suggested to reduce the risk of prostate cancer (CaP), but no data exists on how oral phytoestrogen supplementation influences phytoestrogen concentrations in prostate tissue.","Forty men with CaP, assigned for radical prostatectomy, received 240 mg of clover phytoestrogens or placebo daily for a 2-week period before their operation in a prospective and randomized study. Phytoestrogens were measured in plasma and prostate tissue by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA).","All patients had low baseline phytoestrogen concentrations and only 35% had a detectable plasma concentration of equol. Oral supplementation with phytoestrogens induced a statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) 23- and 7-fold increase in prostate tissue concentrations of the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein, respectively. Supplemented patients demonstrated prostate tissue genistein and daidzein concentrations that were over twofold higher than their plasma. Interestingly, even though the placebo group did not receive phytoestrogen challenge, they also demonstrated twofold prostate tissue genistein and daidzein concentrations compared to their plasma values, suggesting that the prostate can concentrate available phytoestrogens. In addition, after the supplementation, 90% of the supplemented patients had a detectable plasma equol concentration.",We conclude that prostate tissue can concentrate genistein and daidzein. Significant elevation of intraprostatic genistein and daidzein concentrations can be achieved with a short-term dietary phytoestrogen supplementation.
826,9634050,To test if supplemental dietary selenium is associated with changes in the incidence of prostate cancer.,A total of 974 men with a history of either a basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma were randomized to either a daily supplement of 200 microg of selenium or a placebo. Patients were treated for a mean of 4.5 years and followed for a mean of 6.5 years.,"Selenium treatment was associated with a significant (63%) reduction in the secondary endpoint of prostate cancer incidence during 1983-93. There were 13 prostate cancer cases in the selenium-treated group and 35 cases in the placebo group (relative risk, RR=0.37, P=0.002). Restricting the analysis to the 843 patients with initially normal levels of prostate-specific antigen (&lt; or = 4 ng/mL), only four cases were diagnosed in the selenium-treated group and 16 cases were diagnosed in the placebo group after a 2 year treatment lag, (RR=0.26 P=0.009). There were significant health benefits also for the other secondary endpoints of total cancer mortality, and the incidence of total, lung and colorectal cancer. There was no significant change in incidence for the primary endpoints of basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In light of these results, the 'blinded' phase of this trial was stopped early.","Although selenium shows no protective effects against the primary endpoint of squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin, the selenium-treated group had substantial reductions in the incidence of prostate cancer, and total cancer incidence and mortality that demand further evaluation in well-controlled prevention trials."
827,10971166,"In addition to nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy treatment, cancer patients can experience these side effects prior to a treatment session, the so-called anticipatory nausea and vomiting.

At each time point, participants also completed 24-hour dietary recalls and questionnaires focusing on their physical activity levels.","A total of 217 women participated in baseline and 12-month follow-up. Three fourths were Hispanic. All three intervention groups showed an increase in self-reported weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, with no significant differences between the groups. Significantly more women who received the comprehensive intervention of provider counseling, health education, and CHW support progressed to eating five fruits and vegetables per day, compared with participants who received only provider counseling or provider counseling plus health education.","All three interventions increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity but not fruit and vegetable consumption.

830,12385925,To determine whether supplemental amounts of a polysaccharide/oligosaccharide complex obtained from a shiitake mushroom extract (SME) would lower the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in patients with prostate cancer.,"A total of 62 men (mean age 73.2 years, range 53.6 to 85.5) with histologically proven prostate cancer who had two consecutive elevated PSA readings were accrued to the study during a 3-month period. This was an open-label study in which the patients received oral administration of capsules containing SME given three times daily for 6 months. The endpoint for the trial was the lowering of the PSA levels.","Of the 62 men enrolled in the study, 61 were assessable. At 4 months, 1 patient withdrew because of unrelated surgery and 7 withdrew because of disease progression; none had responded with a decrease of greater than 50% in the PSA level. By 6 months, a total of 23 patients had progression and none had responded. Thirty-eight patients had stable PSA levels after 6 months. Although not the primary endpoint of the study, in other studies these patients could have been included as responders. When the patients' rates of PSA rise before study entry were analyzed, 4 (7%) had stabilized disease while taking SME. Thus, the final results for our study patients were 0 with a complete response, 0 with a partial response, 4 (7%) with stable disease, and 23 of 61 with progression while taking SME.",SME alone is ineffective in the treatment of clinical prostate cancer.
831,30121789,"Acute leukemia (AL) and its initial treatment can impair physical functioning and capacity significantly. Exercise as a countermeasure has been investigated in few studies confirming its feasibility and safety during intensive induction chemotherapy, but the relative effects of diverse exercise programs have not been analyzed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate independent effects of endurance and resistance training on physical capacity and quality of life (QOL).","Twenty-nine adult AL patients were randomly allocated to an endurance (EG), resistance (RG), or control (CG) group. The intervention took place during induction chemotherapy with three exercise sessions per week for 30-45\u00a0min each. Endurance capacity at individual anaerobic threshold, maximum knee extension and flexion strength, standardized phase angle (SPA), and QOL were measured at baseline prior to induction chemotherapy and before discharge.","Endurance capacity changed in neither the EG, RG, or CG (P\u2009=\u20090.104); descriptively, the EG (-\u20090.05\u00a0W/kg) and RG (-\u20090.04\u00a0W/kg) exhibited a smaller decrease than CG (-\u20090.22\u00a0W/kg). We noted a significant difference in knee extension strength (P\u2009=\u20090.002); RG improved their maximum strength (+\u20090.14\u00a0Nm/kg), while the EG's (-\u20090.13\u00a0Nm/kg) and CG's (-\u20090.19\u00a0Nm/kg) was significantly reduced. QOL and SPA revealed no change after the intervention.","We conclude that resistance training is a key component when exercising during induction chemotherapy: it improved maximum strength, but also influenced endurance capacity even during intensive treatment. Considering the prognostic value of physical function, we strongly propose integrating exercise, especially resistance-based training, already during induction chemotherapy to preserve AL patients' physical capacity and functional status."
832,12609560,To examine the effect of Cimicifuga racemosa (CR BNO 1055) on hot flushes caused by tamoxifen adjuvant therapy in young premenopausal breast cancer survivors. This treatment presents an off-label use of CR BNO 1055.,"Between May 1999 and December 2001, we accrued 136 breast cancer survivors aged 35-52 years.

Duration of treatment was 5 years for tamoxifen, according to international standards for adjuvant therapies, and 12 months for CR BNO 1055. Follow-up included clinical assessment every 2 months; the primary endpoint was to record the number and intensity of hot flushes.","Comparing patients assigned to usual-care group with those assigned to intervention group, the number and severity of hot flushes were reduced after intervention. Almost half of the patients of the intervention group were free of hot flushes, while severe hot flushes were reported by 24.4% of patients of intervention group and 73.9% of the usual-care group (P&lt;0.01).",Hot flushes were the most frequent adverse reaction to tamoxifen adjuvant therapy in breast cancer survivors. The combined administration of tamoxifen plus CR BNO 1055 for a period of 12 months allowed satisfactory reduction in the number and severity of hot flushes.

Few studies have examined whether community-based participatory research can effectively address Asian immigrants' health problems. This article reports the preliminary evaluation of 1 such project.,"A coalition of 11 organizations in Santa Clara County, California worked with university researchers to design and simultaneously implement a media education (ME) campaign and a lay health worker outreach (LHWO) program to increase Vietnamese-American women's cervical cancer awareness, knowledge, and screening. Two agencies each recruited 10 lay health workers (LHWs), who, in turn, each recruited 20 women who were then randomized into 2 groups: 10 to LHWO+ME (n = 200) and 10 to ME alone (n = 200). LHWs organized meetings with women to increase their knowledge and to motivate them to obtain Pap tests. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires.","At post-intervention, significantly more LHWO+ME women understood that human papillomavirus and smoking cause cervical cancer. The number of women who had obtained a Pap test increased significantly among women in both LHWO+ME and ME groups, but substantially more in the LHWO+ME group. Significantly more LHWO+ME women said they intended to have a Pap test.","Media education campaigns can increase Vietnamese women's awareness of the importance of Pap tests, but lay health workers are more effective at encouraging women to actually obtain the tests. Lay health workers are effective because they use their cultural knowledge and social networks to create change. Researchers, community members, and community-based organizations can share expert knowledge and skills, and build one another's capacities."
834,11106679,"Previous research has identified a high risk of gastric carcinoma as well as a high prevalence of cancer precursor lesions in rural populations living in the province of Nari\u00f1o, Colombia, in the Andes Mountains.","A randomized, controlled chemoprevention trial was conducted in subjects with confirmed histologic diagnoses of multifocal nonmetaplastic atrophy and/or intestinal metaplasia, two precancerous lesions. Individuals were assigned to receive anti-Helicobacter pylori triple therapy and/or dietary supplementation with ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, or their corresponding placebos. Gastric biopsy specimens taken at baseline were compared with those taken at 72 months. Relative risks of progression, no change, and regression from multifocal nonmetaplastic atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were analyzed with multivariate polytomous logistic regression models to estimate treatment effects. All statistical tests were two-sided.","All three basic interventions resulted in statistically significant increases in the rates of regression: Relative risks were 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-14.2) for anti-H. pylori treatment, 5. 1 (95% CI = 1.7-15.0) for beta-carotene treatment, and 5.0 (95% CI = 1.7-14.4) for ascorbic acid treatment in subjects with atrophy. Corresponding relative risks of regression in subjects with intestinal metaplasia were 3.1 (95% CI = 1.0-9.3), 3.4 (95% CI = 1.1-9.8), and 3.3 (95% CI = 1.1-9.5). Combinations of treatments did not statistically significantly increase the regression rates. Curing the H. pylori infection (which occurred in 74% of the treated subjects) produced a marked and statistically significant increase in the rate of regression of the precursor lesions (relative risks = 8.7 [95% CI = 2.7-28.2] for subjects with atrophy and 5.4 [95% CI = 1.7-17.6] for subjects with intestinal metaplasia).","In the very high-risk population studied, effective anti-H. pylori treatment and dietary supplementation with antioxidant micronutrients may interfere with the precancerous process, mostly by increasing the rate of regression of cancer precursor lesions, and may be an effective strategy to prevent gastric carcinoma."
835,11199242,"The objective was to determine the impact of a multimedia device offering information about malignant melanoma on public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.","Two municipalities in Sweden, Dalby and S Sandby, were chosen. The population of Dalby was exposed to the multimedia program during 1994-97, whereas the S Sandby population was not. A questionnaire was sent to random samples of the populations (10% of those aged 20-59 years) before (1994, n = 373 and n = 409, respectively) and after the intervention (1996, n = 375 and n = 418, respectively). Response rates were 74-89%.","The groups were well balanced at baseline. In both areas women scored higher both at baseline and in 1996. Dalby women showed less fear of skin cancer in 1996 than in 1994 (2.13 vs 2.27, p &lt; 0.01). This was not so in the controls. There was no major change in &quot;sun behavior&quot; in Dalby, whereas there was a negative change in S Sandby. After the intervention Dalby men had more &quot;knowledge&quot; (from 2.64 to 2.70, p &lt; 0.05) and a tendency to better &quot;sun behavior&quot; (from 1.77 to 1.85, p = 0.076). There was no significant change over time in the S Sandby men.","The multimedia program had a modest effect. The population in Dalby had more knowledge and changed its attitudes in a sun-protective direction. In the control area, the two-year follow-up sun behavior score was lower than at baseline. There was also significantly less fear of skin cancer after the intervention."
836,15480814,"Up to 90% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients suffer cognitive dysfunction. Since donepezil and vitamin E have been somewhat successful in treating other dementias, this study tested the hypothesis that these agents can prevent cognitive decline in SCLC patients. Because accrual was poor, this trial also offered opportunities for suggesting other study designs for future clinical trials on cognitive dysfunction in this group of patients.","This double blind, placebo controlled trial tested oral donepezil 5 mg/day (with dose escalation to 10 mg after 1 month) and oral vitamin E 1,000 IU/day in SCLC patients after completion of all cancer therapy, including prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Cognition, adverse events, and quality of life were assessed throughout the study period.","Only nine of 104 patients enrolled over 15 months (four donepezil and vitamin E-treated versus five placebo-exposed), and thus no definitive conclusions could be drawn. Nonetheless, the only patient who manifested a precipitous decline in cognition was taking donepezil and vitamin E. There was also a slight trend of increased gastrointestinal side effects among donepezil and vitamin E-treated patients. There were no notable differences in cognitive stability, adverse events, or quality of life between treatment arms.",These preliminary findings do not provide enthusiasm for testing donepezil and vitamin E in the manner undertaken here for preventing cognitive dysfunction in SCLC patients. Eligibility criteria and timing of trial intervention are discussed as potential impediments to successful trial completion.
837,18626666,Patients with head and neck cancer have complex needs that affect many basic functions of life and contribute to substantial psychosocial problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a problem-focused intervention for patients with psychosocial dysfunction who had completed treatment for head and neck cancer.,"Using a quasi-experimental design, 54 participants who were above pre-determined cutoff points for psychosocial dysfunction (hospital and depression scale, work and social adjustment scale) were given the opportunity to self-select into either the experimental group for the psychosocial intervention programme which was delivered in an individualised format, with bibliotherapy as an adjunct, or the control group for usual care.","Analysis of covariance results demonstrated a reduction in psychological distress (anxiety, p = 0.001; depression, p = 0.005), improving social functioning (p = 0.048) and quality of life scores (p = &lt;0.05) for the experimental group, all of which were sustained into the 3-month follow-up period. No such improvements were evident for the control group.","This study suggests that head and neck cancer patients with post-treatment psychosocial dysfunction can benefit from a problem-focused psychosocial intervention. Such evidence can inform practice, policy and future research, aimed at improving post-treatment quality of life for patients with head and neck cancer."
838,8989634,"The five-year survival rate for African American women with breast cancer is notably lower than the rate for white women; thus, appropriate cancer education and screening efforts are needed to increase mammography and breast self-examination practices by African American women.","The Witness Project is a theory-based intervention designed to provide culturally sensitive messages, from African American breast cancer survivors, in churches and community organizations. These messages emphasize the importance of early detection to improve survival.",Intervention research in eastern Arkansas with 204 African American women demonstrated a significant increase in the practice of breast self-examination (p &lt; 0.001) and mammography (p &lt; 0.001) after participation in the Witness Project. There was no significant difference between the pre- and postintervention scores for scaled items for the health-belief model and locus of control.,Results demonstrate that culturally appropriate cancer education programs are able to change behavior by meeting the beliefs of participants rather than attempting to change their beliefs.
839,16086914,Radiation-induced tissue fibrosis is a common adverse effect of curative treatment for pelvic cancer. Pilot studies testing alpha-tocopherol and pentoxifylline provide evidence of clinical regression of superficial radiation fibrosis after radiotherapy.,"Twenty-seven eligible research volunteers with a minimum of one grade 3 or 4 disability (LENT SOMA) due to previous radiotherapy were entered into the study. Volunteers were given dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate 500 mg twice a day orally plus pentoxifylline 400mg twice a day orally over a period of 6 months. Clinical assessment of late side effects recorded using LENT SOMA scales was selected as the primary endpoint, taken at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-registration. Patient self-assessment of function and quality of life was assessed as a secondary endpoint using the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire and the EORTC QLQ-CR38 pelvic module. Magnetic resonance imaging was undertaken in 13/23 evaluable volunteers before and after 6 months of therapy.","At 12 months post-registration there were 4 out of 23 responders. At 6 months post-registration there was a statistically significant improvement (i.e. reduction) in the median of the LENT SOMA summed scores in all areas assessed apart from 'male sexual dysfunction', 'vulva' and 'vagina' which were unchanged at 6 months. The median total LENT SOMA score at baseline and 6 months was 49 and 34, respectively, with a median change in total LENT SOMA score between baseline and 6 months of 9 (IQR 7-18) (P&lt;0.001). The maximum LENT SOMA scores improved over the study period, with a total number of 82 maximum grade 3 or 4 normal tissue scores at baseline (median of four complications per person) reduced to a total number of 67 maximum grade 3 or 4 scores at 6 months post-registration (median of 3 complications per person), i.e. a median reduction in severe complications of one per person. LENT SOMA scores at 12 months were similar to those observed at 6 month suggesting no further improvement nor deterioration in late side effects. These findings were, however, not reflected in the patient self-assessment of function and quality of life, raising question about the possibility of observer bias in recording LENT SOMA scores. No significant changes were reported on magnetic resonance images at 6 months from baseline.","Despite only seeing four a priori defined responders in this pilot study testing dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate plus pentoxifylline in patients suffering complications of pelvic radiotherapy, changes in LENT SOMA scores suggest beneficial effects. However, we are not convinced that these effects are real, since no significant changes in symptoms and functional status were recorded by detailed prospective patient self-assessments."
840,20605898,Alterations in circulating steroids are believed to be important mediators of the impact that diet and exercise have on breast cancer risk and changes in bone density. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that moderate exercise training combined with caloric restriction would produce significant menstrual disturbances and alterations in ovarian steroids in premenopausal women.,"Sedentary premenopausal women (25-40 years; body mass index: 23.6 +/- 0.6 kg/m(2)) assigned to either a light conditioning (LC, n = 9) or an exercise combined with caloric restriction group (EX + CR, n = 24) were studied for one screening, one baseline and four intervention periods equivalent to the length of subjects' menstrual cycles. Exercise consisted of supervised training sessions, i.e. two LC or four EX + CR times per week, 30-60 min at a moderate intensity. The EX + CR group was prescribed a diet representing a caloric restriction of 20-35% below baseline energy requirements, whereas the LC group remained eucaloric. Ovarian steroid exposure was determined with daily urinary estrone-1- and pregnanediol glucuronides (E1G and PdG, respectively) and mid-cycle urinary LH measures. Fitness, body composition, and serum sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and serum estradiol (E2) were assessed repeatedly.","The intervention produced significant increases in VO(2) max and decreases in both body weight (-3.7 +/- 0.5 kg; ranged from -8.8 to +1.8 kg) and percent body fat (-4.5 +/- 0.7%; ranged from -12 to +0.3%), which were attributable primarily to changes in the EX + CR subjects (time x group; P &lt; 0.05). Serum E2 and urinary E1G and PdG concentrations declined significantly across the intervention period (time; P &lt; 0.05), whereas SHBG increased transiently (time; P &lt; 0.05) in the EX + CR subjects, with no significant changes observed in the LC group. The decrease in E1G area under the curve was significantly related to the daily energy deficit (R =0.61; P = 0.003), not the amount of weight lost. There was no significant impact of the intervention on menstrual cyclicity or the incidence of menstrual disturbances in either group.",A moderate aerobic exercise training program combined with modest weight loss in accordance with recommended guidelines produces significant reductions in ovarian steroid exposure without disrupting menstrual cyclicity in premenopausal women aged 25-40 years. Exposure to a daily energy deficit is a stronger predictor of the decline in estrogen exposure than decreases in body weight.
841,18166837,Only 3 to 5% of new adult cancer patients participate in clinical trials nationwide. The lack of knowledge and awareness about clinical trials is a significant barrier to clinical trials participation. A randomized trial was conducted to test the effect of an educational video on positively changing patients' knowledge and attitudes regarding clinical trials and thereby increasing enrollment rates.,"Lung cancer patients were randomized to viewing either an 18-minute video about clinical trials before first clinic appointment or to standard care. Participants completed a baseline and 2-week postintervention survey to assess their knowledge and attitudes toward trials participation. Fisher's exact test tests, t tests, and regression were used to compare patient characteristics and outcomes between arms.","Of 145 subjects randomized, 126 (63/arm) satisfied all inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. A linear regression showed that the video intervention was significantly associated with patients' self-assessed likelihood to enroll score measured at 2-week follow-up (p = 0.019). Although statistically insignificant, enrollment rates were found to be higher in the intervention arm for therapeutic trials alone (17.5% versus 11.1%) and for therapeutic and nontherapeutic trials combined (25.4% versus 15.9%).","The brief educational video seems to be effective in positively changing lung cancer patients' attitudes about participation in clinical trials. Higher enrollment rates were also observed in the intervention group but the differences did not reach statistical significance. These findings suggest a potential impact of the educational video on clinical trial enrollment; however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings."
842,21608221,"To observe clinical efficacy of Huazhuo Jiedu Recipe (HJR) on chronic atrophic gastritic precancerosis (CAGP), and its effect on contents of lactic acid, total acid, free acid, and nitrite in the gastric juice, as well as tumor markers in gastric juice and blood.","Two hundred and twenty-nine patients with CAGP were randomly assigned to two groups, the 119 patients in the treated group orally took HJR and the 110 patients in the control group orally took Weifuchun Tablet. The therapeutic course for all was three months, two courses in total. The therapeutic efficacy, changes of gastric acid contents before and after treatment were observed, and the tumor markers in the gastric juice and blood were detected using electrochemical luminescence immunoassay.","The pathological effective rate was 83.2% (99/119) in the treated group and 60.9% (67/110) in the control group, showing significant difference between the two groups (P &lt;0.05). The total acids and free acids in the gastric juice were significantly improved, contents of lactic acid and nitrite were significantly lowered in the two groups. Both contents of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen19-9 (CA19-9), carbohydrate antigen72-4 (CA72-4), and carbohydrate antigen125 (CA125) in the gastric juice and serum were significantly lowered after treatment in the treated group (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the normal control group, the therapeutic effect was more obvious in the treated group (P&lt;0.05).","HJR could stimulate the gastric membranous secretion, enhance contents of total acids and free acids. It could prevent the further progress of CAGP by decreasing contents of lactic acid and nitrite in the gastric juice, and lowering contents of CEA, CA19-9, CA72-4, and CA125 in the gastric juice and serum."
843,12050092,Markers of genetic susceptibility to tobacco-related cancers could personalize harms of smoking and motivate cessation. Our objective was to assess whether a multicomponent intervention that included feedback about genetic susceptibility to lung cancer increased risk perceptions and rates of smoking cessation compared with a standard cessation intervention.,"Our design was a two-arm trial with eligible smokers randomized in a 1:2 ratio to Enhanced Usual Care or Biomarker Feedback (BF). Surveys were conducted at baseline, 6, and 12 months later. The setting was an inner city community health clinic. African-American patients who were current smokers (n = 557) were identified by chart abstraction and provider referral. All smokers received a self-help manual and, if appropriate, nicotine patches. Smokers in the BF arm also were offered a blood test for genotyping the GST(3) gene (GSTM1), sent a test result booklet, and called up to four times by a health educator. Prevalent abstinence was assessed by self-report of having smoked no cigarettes in the prior 7 days at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups and sustained abstinence, i.e., not smoking at either follow-up or in-between.","Smoking cessation was greater for the BF arm than the Enhanced Usual Care arm (19% versus 10%, respectively; P &lt; 0.006) at 6 months but not at 12 months.","Smokers agreed to genetic feedback as part of a multicomponent cessation program. Although the program increased short-term cessation rates compared with standard intervention, genetic feedback of susceptibility may not benefit smokers with high baseline risk perceptions."
844,28001305,"Colorectal cancer screening rates for African American patients remain suboptimal. Patient decision aids designed with an entertainment-education approach have been shown to improve saliency and foster informed decision making. The purpose of this study was to assess whether an entertainment-education decision aid tailored for African American patients improved patients' decision making, attitudes, intentions, or colorectal cancer screening behavior.","Eighty-nine participants were randomized to view 1) a patient decision aid video containing culturally tailored information about colorectal cancer screening options and theory-based support in decision making presented in an entertainment-education format or 2) an attention control video about hypertension that contained similarly detailed information. Participants met with their clinician and then completed follow-up questionnaires assessing their knowledge, decisional conflict, self-advocacy, attitudes, perceived social norms, and intentions. At 3 months, completion of screening was assessed by chart review.","Viewing the culturally tailored decision aid significantly increased African American patients' knowledge of colorectal cancer screening recommendations and options. It also significantly reduced their decisional conflict and improved their self-advocacy. No significant differences were observed in participants' attitudes, norms, or intentions. At three months, 23% of all patients had completed a colonoscopy.","Designing targeted, engaging patient decision aids for groups that receive suboptimal screening holds promise for improving patient decision making and self-advocacy. Additional research is warranted to investigate the effectiveness of such aids in clinical practices with suboptimal screening rates and on downstream behaviors (such as repeat testing).

845,16579250,Major surgery is often followed by fatigue and reduced physical function. We wished to study if postoperative physical training reduced fatigue and improved physical function.,"Randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blinded study. Participants were unselected patients &gt; or = 60 years undergoing elective colorectal surgery without disseminated cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Group A trained muscular strength and work capacity. Group B performed relaxation exercises and received hot wrappings and massage. Main outcome measures were: fatigue (visual analogue scale), muscular strength, walking speed, physical performance test, and physical function questions (SF-36).","Preoperatively the two groups were similar except that A was more fatigued than B. By postoperative day seven fatigue had increased compared to preoperatively, more in B than A, but by day 30 and 90 there were no significant differences between groups. All indices of physical function decreased postoperative day seven and were at the preoperative level day 90 with no significant differences between groups in change in function. Day seven the change in knee extension strength tended to be lower in B than A but by day 30 changes were similar in both groups.","Postoperative training did not improve physical function, but reduced fatigue in hospital."
846,17450417,Modifying multiple behavior risks is a promising approach to reduce cancer risk. Primary prevention advices of the European Code against Cancer were included in an educational intervention (EI) using social cognitive theories for motivating families with cancer experiences to adopt six cancer prevention behaviors.,"A randomized clinical controlled trial recruited 3,031 patients from Primary Care among cancer patients' relatives. The experimental group (EG) received four EI, one EI every six months, focused on tobacco, alcohol, diet, weight, sun and work, and based on social cognitive models. The impact of the first three EI was calculated measuring at baseline and 18 months later: (a) The percentage of people with each risk behavior; (b) The score reached in a Total Cancer Behavioral Risk (TCBR) indicator; (c) The Odds Ratios at the post-test.","Five risk behaviors decreased significantly more (p&lt;0.01) in the EG than in the CG: Smoking (OR=0.662), drinking (OR=0.504), diet (OR=0.542), weight (OR=0.698), and sun (OR=0.389). The TCBR indicator also decreased an average of nearly 5 points (28.42 vs. 23.82), significantly more (p&lt;0.001) in the EG.",Families with cancer experiences changed five cancer risk behaviors when approached in Primary Care with interventions based on social cognitive models.
847,19949016,Androgen suppression therapy (AST) results in musculoskeletal toxicity that reduces physical function and quality of life. This study examined the impact of a combined resistance and aerobic exercise program as a countermeasure to these AST-related toxicities.,"Between 2007 and 2008, 57 patients with prostate cancer undergoing AST (commenced &gt; 2 months prior) were randomly assigned to a program of resistance and aerobic exercise (n = 29) or usual care (n = 28) for 12 weeks. Primary end points were whole body and regional lean mass. Secondary end points were muscle strength and function, cardiorespiratory capacity, blood biomarkers, and quality of life.","Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline values and potential confounders. Patients undergoing exercise showed an increase in lean mass compared with usual care (total body, P = .047; upper limb, P &lt; .001; lower limb, P = .019) and similarly better muscle strength (P &lt; .01), 6-meter walk time (P = .024), and 6-meter backward walk time (P = .039). Exercise also improved several aspects of quality of life including general health (P = .022) and reduced fatigue (P = .021) and decreased levels of C-reactive protein (P = .008). There were no adverse events during the testing or exercise intervention program.","A relatively brief exposure to exercise significantly improved muscle mass, strength, physical function, and balance in hypogonadal men compared with normal care. The exercise regimen was well tolerated and could be recommended for patients undergoing AST as an effective countermeasure to these common treatment-related adverse effects."
848,27494528,To assess the moderating role of demographic and clinical variables on the efficacy of a video-based cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (VCBT-I) among breast cancer patients.,"As part of a randomized controlled trial, 80 women received VCBT-I.","Patients with a more advanced breast cancer were less likely to show reductions on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and increased sleep efficiency at posttreatment. Patients using an antidepressant medication showed a larger reduction of ISI scores and a higher rate of insomnia remission. Remission of insomnia was also significantly more likely in individuals with a higher annual income. When using a multivariate binary classification tree analysis, the best and unique predictor of insomnia remission was having a less severe baseline ISI score.","Although efficacious in general, VCBT-I does not appear to be an optimal format for everybody."
849,9863121,To seek for the effective therapeutical method in treating non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).,"One hundred and sixty seven patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomly divided into two groups, the treatment group, which consisted of 112 cases using Chinese herbs combined with chemotherapy and 55 cases of control group were treated by chemotherapy only.","The effective rate (CR + PR) in the combined group was 91.96% and survival rates of 1-, 3- and 5-year were 85.7%, 54.5% and 29.5% respectively, and median survival time was 554 days. In control group the effective rate was 72.73% and 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 76.4%, 38.2% and 18.2% respectively, and the median survival time was 465 days. The difference of effective rates or 3-year survival rates between two groups was significant (P &lt; 0.05). In the combined group the activity of NK cell, OKT3, OKT4 and ratio of OKT4/OKT8 were obviously raised after treatment (P &lt; 0.01). And the level of platelet adhesion rate and the blood viscosity markedly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), but in the control group the values of these indexes did not distinctly change.",Chinese herbs could enhance the immunologic function and improve the viscosity of blood of the patients with NHL. The side effect in the combination therapy group was less and milder than that in the chemotherapy group. These showed that Chinese herbs combined with chemotherapy was a safe and effective method for treating NHL and deserve to be recommended.
850,29736007,"Testicular cancer survivors (TCS) are at increased risk of cancer-related fatigue (CRF), psychosocial impairment, and poor mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

Mediation by cardiorespiratory fitness and moderation by clinical characteristics suggests opportunities for targeted exercise interventions to optimise PROs in TCS.
851,30062572,Some studies suggest that telomere shortening may be associated with increased breast cancer risk and mortality. Obesity is also associated with increased breast cancer risk and mortality. Few studies have examined changes in telomere length in overweight or obese breast cancer survivors. The purpose of our study was to examine the effect of a 6-month diet- and exercise-induced weight loss intervention versus usual care on telomere length in breast cancer survivors.,"151 breast cancer survivors with body mass index (BMI)\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0kg/m were randomly assigned to a 6-month weight loss intervention (n\u2009=\u200993) or to usual care (n\u2009=\u200958). Fasting blood samples, height, weight, physical activity, and diet were measured at baseline and 6-months. Relative telomere length (RTL) was measured by quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) done on buffy coat-extracted genomic DNA. Mean baseline to 6-month changes were compared between groups (intention-to-treat) using generalized estimating equations.","Complete telomere data were available in 125 participants. Women were 58\u2009\u00b1\u20098 years, with BMI 33.0\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2\u00a0kg/m and were 2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20092.5\u00a0years from diagnosis; 90% were non-Hispanic white, and 76% had stage 0/I breast cancer. After 6 months, women randomized to weight loss had 3% telomere lengthening compared to 5% shortening in the usual care group (p\u2009=\u20090.12). Among women with stage 0/I, the intervention group experienced 7% telomere lengthening compared to 8% shortening in the usual care group (p\u2009=\u20090.01). No intervention effect was observed in women with stage II/III breast cancer.","Our findings suggest a weight loss intervention in stage 0 and 1 breast cancer survivors may lead to telomere lengthening, compared to a shortening in their usual care counterparts."
852,21464779,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate bowel-cleansing methods for colonic preparation, based on the findings of PET-computed tomographic (CT) scans.","A total of 175 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients with medical histories of colorectal cancer, abdominal operation, or abdominal malignancies were excluded from this study. The patients were divided into three groups according to the three kinds of bowel-cleansing methods used: (i) no laxatives or dietary restriction (control group), (ii) dietary restriction (low-residue diet), and (iii) a combination of contact laxatives (Dulcolax) and dietary restriction (low-residue diet). Colonic standardized uptake value data were recorded. The hot spots that influenced the interpretation of images or the localization of true lesions were classified as positive (+), whereas data that did not influence clinical diagnosis were classified as negative (-).","In the first group, 22.2% of the patients with positive colonic hot spots were detected in whole-body PET-CT scans. In the second group, a 34.9% positive rate of colonic hot spots was visible. In the third group, a 73.5% positive rate was detected. The positive rate in the third group is significantly higher than the percentages detected in the first and the second groups (P&lt;0.01).","The findings indicated that a low-residue diet is not beneficial to colonic preparation. Moreover, contact laxatives cause diagnostic confusion when PET-CT images are interpreted. Therefore, although PET-CT scans are capable of adding precision to functional imaging, and to focal localization, the researchers concluded that avoiding contact laxatives is necessary to decrease intestinal artifacts."
853,24629504,This randomized controlled trial of outpatients with breast cancer (stage I or II) evaluated the effects of a 3-week educational intervention on patient levels of fatigue.,"Norwegian outpatients were randomized into an intervention group (n = 79) and a control group (n = 81). Women with fatigue (&gt;2.5 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale, NRS) completed the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ) and the Lee Fatigue Scale (LFS) at baseline (after treatment) (T1), immediately after intervention (T2) and 3 months after intervention (T3).","The mean fatigue score (NRS) at study entry was 6.1 (SD 1.7) and 36% (n = 57) had a score \u22657.

Using an NRS cut-off of 5, there was a borderline difference for women who scored &lt;5 for chronic fatigue on FQ (p = 0.062) and a significant difference for energy on LFS (p = 0.042) where the women in the intervention group had less fatigue. Using an NRS cut-off score of 6, there was a borderline difference for women who scored &lt;6 for fatigue on FQ (p = 0.062) and a significant difference for energy on LFS (p = 0.021) where women in the intervention group had more energy than those in the control group.",Further research is needed to identify psycho-educational interventions to reduce levels of fatigue and to tailor an intervention based on the level of fatigue. Fatigue measurements should be chosen more carefully.
854,16135471,To evaluate the efficacy of a psychoeducational intervention in improving cancer-related fatigue.,"This randomized controlled trial involved 109 women commencing adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I or II breast cancer in five chemotherapy treatment centers. Intervention group patients received an individualized fatigue education and support program delivered in the clinic and by phone over three 10- to 20-minute sessions 1 week apart. Instruments included a numeric rating scale assessing confidence with managing fatigue; 11-point numeric rating scales measuring fatigue at worst, average, and best; the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue and Piper Fatigue Scales; the Cancer Self-Efficacy Scale; the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30; and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. For each outcome, separate analyses of covariance of change scores between baseline (T1) and the three follow-up time points (T2, T3, and T4) were conducted, controlling for the variable's corresponding baseline value.","Compared with the intervention group, mean difference scores between the baseline (T1) and immediate after the test (T2) assessments increased significantly more for the control group for worst and average fatigue, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue, and Piper fatigue severity and interference measures. These differences were not observed between baseline and T3 and T4 assessments. No significant differences were identified for any pre- or post-test change scores for confidence with managing fatigue, cancer self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, or quality of life.","Preparatory education and support has the potential to assist women to cope with cancer-related fatigue in the short term. However, further research is needed to identify ways to improve the potency and sustainability of psychoeducational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue."
855,14966096,"To examine the effects on process of care and patient well-being, of the regular collection and use of health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) data in oncology practice.","In a prospective study with repeated measures involving 28 oncologists, 286 cancer patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (regular completion of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Core Quality of Life Questionnaire version 3.0, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale on touch-screen computers in clinic and feedback of results to physicians); attention-control group (completion of questionnaires, but no feedback); or control group (no HRQL measurement in clinic before encounters). Primary outcomes were patient HRQL over time, measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General questionnaire, physician-patient communication, and clinical management, measured by content analysis of tape-recorded encounters. Analysis employed mixed-effects modeling and multiple regression.","Patients in the intervention and attention-control groups had better HRQL than the control group (P =.006 and P =.01, respectively), but the intervention and attention-control groups were not significantly different (P =.80). A positive effect on emotional well-being was associated with feedback of data (P =.008), but not with instrument completion (P =.12). A larger proportion of intervention patients showed clinically meaningful improvement in HRQL. More frequent discussion of chronic nonspecific symptoms (P =.03) was found in the intervention group, without prolonging encounters. There was no detectable effect on patient management (P =.60). In the intervention patients, HRQL improvement was associated with explicit use of HRQL data (P =.016), discussion of pain, and role function (P =.046).","Routine assessment of cancer patients' HRQL had an impact on physician-patient communication and resulted in benefits for some patients, who had better HRQL and emotional functioning."
856,24612414,"Early oral feeding (EOF) following colorectal surgery can accelerate patient recovery and shorten hospital stay. However, some patients are intolerable to postoperative early oral feeding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerability of EOF following laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery and the effects of intravenous lidocaine.","The cohort in this randomized, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01346917) comprised of 77 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. For patients randomized to the lidocaine group, a loading dose of 1\u2009mg/kg lidocaine prior to skin incision, and a continuous dose of 1\u2009mg/kg/h lidocaine with 90\u2009mg ketorolac (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) (in normal saline, total 240\u2009mL) was administered for 24\u2009h. Patients randomized to the placebo group received a loading dose of 5\u2009mL saline and a continuous dose of 90\u2009mg ketorolac in 240\u2009mL saline. The primary outcome measure was prevalence of postoperative nausea/vomiting and intolerance to EOF.","Altogether, 68 patients completed the study and were analyzed. Postoperative nausea and vomiting were higher in the control group but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.054). Tolerability of EOF was 96.9% in the lidocaine group and 91.7% in the control group (P = 0.62). There was no difference in postoperative pain, opioid consumption, bowel function recovery or postoperative hospital stay.","Perioperative intravenous lidocaine administered for laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery might reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, a high tolerability to EOF following colorectal surgery can be achieved by laparoscopic surgery alone without other supportive treatment."
857,17031805,Erythrocyte changes from aerobic exercise training were examined during radiation treatment of breast cancer.,"Twenty sedentary females with breast carcinoma who were ages 35 to 65 years were randomized to aerobic exercise (AE) of walking for 20 to 45 minutes, 3 to 5 times per week, at 50% to 70% of measured maximum heart rates or to placebo stretching (PS) activities 3 to 5 days per week during 7 weeks of radiation treatment. Measures were obtained 1 week before and after the radiation regimen. Serum blood analyses, through complete blood counts, measured red blood cell counts (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), and hemoglobin (HB). Peak aerobic capacity (peak VO(2)) was measured by exercise testing with oxygen uptake analysis to assess training. A Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test examined changes between groups (P &lt; or = .05 for significance).",AE peak VO(2) increased by 6.3% (P = .001) and PS decreased by 4.6% (P = .083). RBC increased in AE from 4.10 to 4.21 million cells/microL and declined in PS from 4.30 to 4.19 million cells/microL; the between-group differences were significant (P = .014). HCT increased in AE from 38.0% to 38.8% and declined in PS from 37.40% to 36.50%; the between-group differences were significant (P = .046). HB increased in AE from 12.3 to 12.4 g/dL and declined in PS from 12.25 to 11.77 g/dL; the between-group differences were significant (P = .009).,"The results of the current study suggest that moderate intensity aerobic exercise appears to maintain erythrocyte levels during radiation treatment of breast cancer compared with the declines observed in nontraining individuals. These findings suggest a safe, economical method to improve fitness and maintain erythrocytes in women during radiation treatment of breast cancer."
858,28181128,"Sleep problems frequently affect breast cancer patients during and after treatment and reduce their quality of life. Treatment strategies are mostly unknown. Thus, we assessed within a randomized controlled trial whether a 12-week exercise program starting with the radiotherapy influences sleep trajectories.","Sleep quality and problems were assessed via self-report in 160 breast cancer patients before, during, and 2, 6, and 12\u00a0months after participation in a trial investigating resistance exercise versus a relaxation control group concomitant with radiotherapy. As additional comparison group, 25 age-matched healthy women exercised and followed identical study procedures. Ordinal logistic regression analyses were used.","The exercise intervention significantly decreased sleep problems compared to the relaxation control group (scale: 0-100, with between-group mean differences of -10.2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) from baseline to the end of radiotherapy and -10.9 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) to the end of the intervention), with sleep problems decreasing in the exercise group and increasing in the control group. At 12\u00a0months, differences were still observed but statistically non-significant (mean difference\u00a0=\u00a0-5.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.20). Further adjustment for potential confounders did not change the results. Several determinants of sleep problems at baseline were identified, e.g., previous chemotherapy and higher body mass index.","Our randomized exercise intervention trial confirmed results from earlier but mostly smaller studies that radiotherapy aggravates sleep problems in breast cancer patients and that exercise can ameliorate these effects. Considering that sleep quality can be a major predictor of quality of life, our findings are of substantial importance to many breast cancer patients."
859,21977863,To study the effect of acupuncture on depression and insomnia of malignant tumor patients.,"Eighty cases of cancer related depression and sleep disorders were randomly divided into 2 groups: treatment 1 group (acupuncture n = 40) and control group (Fluoxetione n = 40). All patients were assessed by Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Hemilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) after treatment for 30 days.","Before treatment the SDS and HAMD scores of the trial group were 64.12 +/- 5.34 and 20.92 +/- 2.38, those of the control group were 64.24 +/- 4.98 and 20.72 +/- 2.74, after treatment the SDS and HAMD scores of the trial group were 43.64 +/- 5.28 and 9.88 +/- 1.27 respectively, significantly lower than those of the control group (50.76 +/- 5.42 and 13.72 +/- 2.05 respectively, both P &lt; 0.05). Before treatment the PSQI score of the trial group and the control group were 14.48 +/- 1.71 and 13.92 +/- 2.59, after treatment the PSQI score of the trial group was 7.92 +/- 1.22 after treatment, significantly lower than those of the control group (11.44 +/- 1.89, P &lt; 0.01).","Acupuncture can effectively reduce malignant-related depression, improve sleep quality, and help to improve the quality of life of cancer patients."
860,7826445,"Although continuing medical education (CME) has long been used to inform physicians and teach specific skills, its efficacy in many areas is not well established. This randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of differing educational techniques on the cancer-control skills of 57 physicians.","The CME program was part of the Cancer Prevention in Community Practice Project in Hanover, New Hampshire, and was implemented in 1988. The program used several methods in its presentation, including interactive small-group discussion, role playing, videotaped clinical encounters, lecture presentations, and trigger tapes. Measurements included cross-sectional observations made by unannounced standardized patients (SPs) who, one year after the CME program, assessed 25 physicians who had participated in the program and 32 physicians who had not. To measure consistency in the SPs' performances and accuracy in assessing the physicians' performances, most interactions were audiotaped using a hidden microphone. Pearson chi-square, Fisher exact two-tailed test, and kappa coefficients were used for analysis.","Significantly higher ratings were found for the CME physicians in two areas: breast cancer risk-factor determination (determined maternal history: 80% versus 52%, p = .03; determined age at first period: 16% versus 0%, p = .02), and smoking cessation counseling (providing written material: 32% versus 9%, p = .03). The CME physicians were rated higher on all 19 study variables in the target areas of early detection of breast cancer and smoking cessation. The results show that the physicians' performance were better in those areas where the CME program had used performance-based learning, such as role playing or viewing and discussing a videotaped role-play encounter.",The educational techniques that rehearsed or portrayed clinical applications seem to have increased the physicians' performances of cancer-control clinical activities. The standardized-patient instrument seems to be particularly useful in evaluating interventions that address specific skills training.
861,27908546,"Maintenance of liver function is important for better outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of oral branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation on liver function, intrahepatic recurrence rate, and incidence of complications after RFA for HCC.","Patients with cirrhosis who underwent RFA were enrolled between August 2009 and April 2012, randomized to oral supplementation with Aminoleban EN (BCAA group) or diet\u00a0alone (control group), and followed to determine changes in serum parameters and health status. Patients in the BCAA group were instructed to ingest a packet of Aminoleban EN twice daily. Levels of physical and mental stress were assessed using the Short Form-8 health survey. Oral BCAA and dietary interventions were initiated 2\u00a0wk before local therapy, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed every 3\u00a0mo to assess recurrence.","We evaluated 25 patients in the BCAA group and 26 in the control group. The median follow-up period was 3.9\u00a0y (736-1818\u00a0d). There were no significant differences between the two groups in basal characteristics. Complications were less frequent in the BCAA group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Event-free survival was significantly higher in the BCAA group, whereas the intrahepatic recurrence rate was significantly lower (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and 0.036, respectively). A significant improvement in the Short Form-8 mental component score was observed in the BCAA group only (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01).",Aminoleban EN may be beneficial for cirrhotic patients after RFA to relieve mental stress and reduce the risks for intrahepatic recurrence and complications.
862,16708359,"Few studies have evaluated cognitive-behavioral interventions as an adjunct treatment for chronic cancer-related pain. A randomized clinical trial was performed evaluating the efficacy of 3 brief cognitive-behavioral techniques: relaxation, distraction, and positive mood interventions.","Fifty-seven patients with chronic cancer-related pain taking opioid medications were randomly assigned to either the relaxation, distraction, positive mood, or waiting-list control group. The patients in the 3 intervention groups received audiotapes of the cognitive-behavioral technique and were asked to practice regularly at home. The tapes were supplemented with written instructions and follow-up telephone calls.","Patients in the relaxation and distraction groups reported significantly reduced pain intensity immediately after listening to the tapes. The pain reduction was not maintained, however. At the 2-week follow-up assessment, no significant differences in pain intensity or interference were found among the treatment groups. The groups also did not differ with regard to secondary outcome measures assessing quality of life, mood, self-efficacy, and other symptoms. The results of qualitative interviews indicated that patients often had difficulty focusing on the audiotapes and preferred their own methods of pain reduction.",Brief relaxation and distraction audiotape interventions produced immediate pain reductions but not longer-term pain relief. Additional research with a more individualized intervention is needed to evaluate cognitive-behavioral interventions for cancer pain control.
863,12960117,"Green tea and green tea polyphenols have been shown to possess cancer preventive activities in preclinical model systems. In preparation for future green tea intervention trials, we have conducted a clinical study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of green tea polyphenols after 4 weeks of daily p.o. administration of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or Polyphenon E (a defined, decaffeinated green tea polyphenol mixture). In an exploratory fashion, we have also determined the effect of chronic green tea polyphenol administration on UV-induced erythema response.","Healthy participants with Fitzpatric skin type II or III underwent a 2-week run-in period and were randomly assigned to receive one of the five treatments for 4 weeks: 800 mg EGCG once/day, 400 mg EGCG twice/day, 800 mg EGCG as Polyphenon E once/day, 400 mg EGCG as Polyphenon E twice/day, or a placebo once/day (8 subjects/group). Samples were collected and measurements performed before and after the 4-week treatment period for determination of safety, pharmacokinetics, and biological activity of green tea polyphenol treatment.","Adverse events reported during the 4-week treatment period include excess gas, upset stomach, nausea, heartburn, stomach ache, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, and muscle pain. All of the reported events were rated as mild events. For most events, the incidence reported in the polyphenol-treated groups was not more than that reported in the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in blood counts and blood chemistry profiles after repeated administration of green tea polyphenol products. There was a &gt;60% increase in the area under the plasma EGCG concentration-time curve after 4 weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at a dosing schedule of 800 mg once daily. No significant changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of EGCG after repeated green tea polyphenol treatment at a regimen of 400 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of the conjugated metabolites of epigallocatechin and epicatechin were not affected by repeated green tea polyphenol treatment. Four weeks of green tea polyphenol treatment at the selected dose and dosing schedule did not provide protection against UV-induced erythema.",We conclude that it is safe for healthy individuals to take green tea polyphenol products in amounts equivalent to the EGCG content in 8-16 cups of green tea once a day or in divided doses twice a day for 4 weeks. There is a &gt;60% increase in the systemic availability of free EGCG after chronic green tea polyphenol administration at a high daily bolus dose (800 mg EGCG or Polyphenon E once daily).
864,16116148,"Cancer survivors smoke at rates that are only slightly lower than the general population. This article reports on the final outcomes of Partnership for Health, a smoking cessation intervention for smokers in the Childhood Cancer Survivors Study (CCSS).","This study is a randomized control trial with follow-up at 8 and 12 months that involved smokers (n = 796) enrolled onto the CCSS cohort. Participants were randomly assigned to either a self-help or a peer-counseling program that included up to six telephone calls from a trained childhood cancer survivor, tailored and targeted materials, and free nicotine replacement therapy. The intervention was delivered by telephone and postal service mail.","The quit rate was significantly higher in the counseling group compared with the self-help group at both the 8-month (16.8% v 8.5%; P &lt; .01) and 12-month follow-ups (15% v 9%; P &lt; or = .01). Controlling for baseline self-efficacy and readiness to change, the intervention group was twice as likely to quit smoking, compared with the self-help group. Smoking cessation rate increased with an increase in the number of counseling calls. The cost of delivering the intervention was approximately 300 dollars per participant. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with controls was 5,371 dollars per additional quit.","Interventions to prevent future illnesses are of critical importance to childhood cancer survivors. The Partnership for Health intervention resulted in a doubling of smoking cessation quit rates. Because of the seriousness of smoking among childhood cancer survivors, this intervention model may be appropriate as a multicomponent treatment program for survivors who smoke."
865,16816226,"The aim of family focused grief therapy is to reduce the morbid effects of grief among families at risk of poor psychosocial outcome. It commences during palliative care of terminally ill patients and continues into bereavement. The authors report a randomized, controlled trial.","Using the Family Relationships Index, the authors screened 257 families of patients dying from cancer: 183 (71%) were at risk, and 81 of those (44%) participated in the trial. They were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to family focused grief therapy (53 families, 233 individuals) or a control condition (28 families, 130 individuals). Assessments occurred at baseline and 6 and 13 months after the patient's death. The primary outcome measures were the Brief Symptom Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Social Adjustment Scale. The Family Assessment Device was a secondary outcome measure. Analyses allowed for correlated family data and employed generalized estimating equations based on intention to treat and controlling for site.","The overall impact of family focused grief therapy was modest, with a reduction in distress at 13 months. Significant improvements in distress and depression occurred among individuals with high baseline scores on the Brief Symptom Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory. Global family functioning did not change. Sullen families and those with intermediate functioning tended to improve overall, whereas depression was unchanged in hostile families.",Family focused grief therapy has the potential to prevent pathological grief. Benefit is clear for intermediate and sullen families. Care is needed to avoid increasing conflict in hostile families.
866,11291370,This article reports findings from a peer-delivered intervention designed to increase use of breast and cervical cancer screening.,"Twenty-six worksites were randomly assigned to the intervention or comparison group. The 16-month intervention consisted of group discussions, outreach, and educational campaigns. Data were collected from a random sample of women employees stratified by age (baseline n = 2943; final n = 2747). Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of the intervention on screening behaviors.","Relative to comparison worksites, the intervention group experienced greater increases in the percentage of women who reported a recent mammogram (7.2% vs 5.6%), clinical breast examination (5.8% vs 2.1%), and Papanicolaou (Pap) test (4.7% vs 1.9%). After worksite cluster and age strata were controlled for, the observed increase in Pap tests was significantly greater in the intervention group (odds ratio [OR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.62); however, differences in mammography screening rates (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.90, 1.44) and clinical breast examination (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 0.96, 1.49) were not statistically significant.","Intervention activities produced a modest increase in cervical cancer screening, but they did not accelerate breast cancer screening rates above the observed secular trend."
867,19295227,Various types of art therapy increasingly gain importance in psycho-oncology. The aim of this article is to determine whether art therapy may help decrease psychological distress and increase coping skills in cancer patients.,"An art therapy course for use in psycho-oncological care for outpatients was developed and implemented in a prospective observation study of the Department of Social Medicine,Leipzig University. Participants' levels of psychological distress (HADS) as well as their coping skills (TSK) were quantitatively evaluated before (t1) and after (t2) the intervention.","After completion of the course mean anxiety of the participants(n = 18) had significantly decreased from 11.06 to 9.33 (p &lt; 0.04). On average, however, participants reported more anxiety both before and after the intervention than a representative comparison group of n = 48 cancer patients (anxiety: mean= 5.51). Regarding depression no significant change could be observed after completion of the intervention (t1 = 6.94, t2 =6.22; p &lt; 0.32). Also in relation to the comparison group (mean= 5.24) no significant difference in depression could be detected (t1: p &lt; 0.066, t2: p &lt; 0.519). No significant change in participants' coping skills could be observed.",The level of psychological distress among cancer patients in outpatient care is above average. This underlines the need for psycho-oncological aftercare services. Art therapy interventions can make an important contribution to the psychological well-being of cancer patients.
868,30007894,Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and potentially dose-limiting side-effect of neurotoxic chemotherapy for cancer patients. We evaluated the preliminary efficacy of acupuncture in preventing worsening CIPN in patients receiving paclitaxel.,"In this phase IIA single-arm clinical trial, we screened stage I-III breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant/adjuvant weekly paclitaxel for development of CIPN. The primary objective was to assess acupuncture's efficacy in preventing the escalation of National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.0, grade II CIPN to higher grades. Acupuncture was deemed worthy of further study if 23 or more of the 27 enrolled patients did not develop grade III CIPN. Outcome measures (NCI-CTCAE CIPN grade, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity [FACT/GOG-Ntx], Neuropathic Pain Scale [NPS]) were obtained weekly during the intervention.","Of 104 patients screened, 37 developed grade II CIPN (36%), and 28 (27%) enrolled into the intervention phase; one was removed due to protocol violation. Of the 27 patients receiving acupuncture, 26 completed paclitaxel treatment without developing grade III CIPN, meeting our prespecified success criteria for declaring acupuncture worthy of further study. FACT/GOG-Ntx and NPS scores remained stable during the intervention while continuing weekly paclitaxel. Acupuncture treatment was well tolerated; 4 of 27 (15%) patients reported grade I bruising.",Acupuncture was safe and showed preliminary evidence of effectiveness in reducing the incidence of high grade CIPN during chemotherapy. A follow-up randomised controlled trial is needed to establish definitive efficacy in CIPN prevention for patients at risk.

A larger randomized trial of longer duration is required to elucidate its potential for improvement in longer term outcomes.
870,15912493,"Shark cartilage has been a popular complementary or alternative medicine intervention. The basis for this popularity is the claim that sharks rarely get cancer because of the high proportion of cartilage in the shark's body. However, early studies were equivocal. Therefore, a clinical trial was conducted to look at the impact of shark cartilage in patients with advanced cancer. The primary goal of this trial was to determine whether a shark cartilage product improved overall survival for patients with advanced cancer who were getting standard care. Secondary research goals were to evaluate toxicities, tolerability, and quality of life associated with this shark cartilage product.","The study was a two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial. Patients with incurable breast or colorectal carcinoma had to have good performance status and organ function. Patients could be receiving chemotherapy. Patients were all to receive standard care and then to be randomly selected to receive either a shark cartilage product or an identical-appearing and smelling placebo 3 to 4 times each day.","Data on a total of 83 evaluable patients were analyzed. There was no difference in overall survival between patients receiving standard care plus a shark cartilage product versus standard care plus placebo. Likewise, there was no suggestion of improvement in quality of life for patients receiving the shark cartilage, compared with those receiving placebo.",This trial was unable to demonstrate any suggestion of efficacy for this shark cartilage product in patients with advanced cancer.

Assessments were made of dietary intake, QOL, and PSA at baseline, after intervention (11 weeks), and 3 months after intervention.","The intervention group showed significant reductions in the consumption of saturated fat and increased consumption of vegetable proteins with accompanying reductions in animal proteins, including dairy products. They also showed increased QOL. Although no significant change was found in the rate of PSA increase between the two groups, the mean PSA doubling time for the intervention group was substantially longer at the 3-month follow-up visit than that of the controls.","Men with a increasing PSA level after primary treatment were able to make a change to a prostate-healthy diet, accompanied by increases in QOL. No significant difference was found in the log PSA slope between the two groups; however, the PSA doubling time increased substantially in the intervention group compared with that in the controls. Future trials should examine the effect of the prostate-healthy diet with a larger sample of men for a longer period."
873,21254914,"The incidence of thyroid cancer is four to five times higher in women than in men, suggesting a role for estrogen (E\u2082) in the pathogenesis of thyroid proliferative disease (TPD) that comprises cancer and goiter. The objective of this study was to investigate the antiestrogenic activity of 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), a bioactive compound derived from cruciferous vegetables, in patients with TPD.","In this limited phase I clinical trial study, patients found to have TPD were administered 300\u2009mg of DIM per day for 14 days. Patients subsequently underwent a total or partial thyroidectomy, and tissue, urine, and serum samples were collected. Pre- and post-DIM serum and urine samples were analyzed for DIM levels as well as estrogen metabolites. DIM levels were also determined in thyroid tissue samples.","DIM was detectable in thyroid tissue, serum, and urine of patients after 14 days of supplementation. Urine analyses revealed that DIM modulated estrogen metabolism in patients with TPD. There was an increase in the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrones (C-2) to 16\u03b1-hydroxyestrone (C-16), consistent with antiestrogenic activity that results in more of C-2 product compared with C-16.",Our data suggest that DIM enhances estrogen metabolism in TPD patients and can potentially serve as an antiestrogenic dietary supplement to help reduce the risk of developing TPD. The fact that DIM is detected in thyroid tissue implicates that it can manifest its antiestrogenic activity in situ to modulate TPD.
874,18646345,"African American men have a significantly higher incidence of prostate cancer, are diagnosed at younger ages and more advanced stages, and have higher mortality rates from prostate cancer than do White men.","This community-based intervention study employed a quasiexperimental delayed-control (crossover) design with randomization at the church level. Forty-five African American churches were randomly assigned to two study groups: early intervention and delayed intervention. A convenience sample of 430 African American male volunteers (ages 40-70) was enrolled through the churches, and 350 men remained in the study through wave 3. The intervention was a culturally tailored group educational program, which included a video and a question-and-answer session with an African American physician.","Within each group, knowledge, perceived threat, and screening prevalence all increased significantly. However, the magnitude of increases was similar, so the groups did not differ significantly at wave 2. Knowledge at wave 2 was associated with greater odds of having a digital rectal exam by wave 3 only for the early-intervention group. The early-intervention group was two times more likely to have talked to a physician about prostate cancer screening by wave 3.","The findings suggest that the delayed-intervention group did not function as a pure control and may have unintentionally received a partial intervention. This finding demonstrated that a low-cost prostate cancer awareness campaign within a church may be enough to affect prostate cancer knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among African American men. Further research should examine the church-specific intervention elements, cultural appropriateness of the messages, and whether group sessions provide additional effect."
875,12296509,This study investigated the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation on the incidence of gastric cancer.,"A total of 29,133 male smokers, aged 50-69 years, participated in a placebo-controlled prevention trial, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study in southwestern Finland between 1985 and 1993. The men were randomly assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol (50 mg/day) or beta-carotene (20 mg/day) supplementation in a 2 x 2 factorial design. We identified 126 gastric cancer cases during the median follow-up of six years. Of these, 122 were adenocarcinomas: 75 of intestinal type, 30 of diffuse type, and 17 of mixed type.","There was no significant effect for either supplementation on the overall incidence of gastric cancer: relative risk (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-1.74 for alpha-tocopherol, and RR 1.26, 95% Cl 0.88-1.80 for beta-carotene. Subgroup analyses by histologic type suggested an increased risk for beta-carotene on intestinal type cancers, RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.99-2.56. There were no differences across anatomic locations (cardia/noncardia) in the effects of alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplementation.",Our study found no overall preventive effect of long-term supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene on gastric cancer in middle-aged male smokers.
876,18532895,Radiotherapy-induced xerostomia seriously reduces the quality of life (QOL) for patients with head and neck cancer. This study aimed to investigate the effects of manual acupuncture on objective and subjective assessment of symptom changes in patients with cancer who have with radiation-induced xerostomia.,Twelve (12) patients with radiation-induced xerostomia were randomized into 2 groups (real or sham acupuncture). Acupuncture was conducted twice weekly for 6 weeks in a single-blind setting. The effect was evaluated by measuring whole salivary flow rates (stimulated and unstimulated) and questionnaire-based assessment of subjective symptoms pre- and post-treatment (3 and 6 weeks after acupuncture treatment).,"Both groups showed a slight increase in whole salivary flow rates, with no significant difference between them. However, real acupuncture markedly increased unstimulated salivary flow rates, and improved the score for dry mouth according to the xerostomia questionnaire, by 2.33 points versus 0.33 in the controls.",Our results showed the significantly meaningful amelioration of the subjective sensation of xerostomia closely associated with QOL in patients with head and neck cancer treated with irradiation.
877,24909376,Patient information in cancer clinical trial is challenging. The value of audio-recording interventions for patients considering participating in clinical trials is unclear. The primary aim of this randomized study was to investigate effects of audio-recorded information on knowledge and understanding in patients considering participation in a clinical trial.,"Patients scheduled for information about a phases 2 or 3 trial by one of the 13 participating oncologists at the Department of Oncology during the study period (2008-2013) were eligible. The intervention consisted of an audio-recording on compact disc (CD) of the information at the medical consultation in which the patients were informed about a trial. Knowledge and understanding was measured by the questionnaire, Quality of Informed Consent.","A total of 130 patients were randomized, 70% of the calculated sample size (n = 186). Sixty-seven patients were randomized to the intervention. In total, 101 patients (78%) completed questionnaires. No statistical significant differences were found between the groups with respect to knowledge and understanding. The level of knowledge was relatively high, with the exceptions of the risks associated with, and the unproven nature of, the trial. Overall, patients who declined participation scored statistically significant lower on knowledge.","The present study was underpowered and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Still, 130 patients were included with a response rate of 78%. A CD including the oral information about a clinical trial did not show any effects on knowledge or understanding. However, the levels of knowledge were high, possible due to the high levels of education in the study group. Information on risks associated with the trial is still an area for improvement."
878,25577501,The purpose of this study is to explore the applicability of a psychosocial intervention in childhood cancer patients.,"This individualized structured psychosocial program to enhance social-emotional functioning and coping with disease-related effects includes six sessions for children and two sessions for parents. This program was part of a combined intervention with physical exercise. Questionnaires are used to evaluate completion of the psychosocial intervention, coping and satisfaction with the psychosocial intervention by patients and psychologists, and ranking of the individual topics by patients, parents, and psychologists.","Of the 30 patients (mean age 13.0 (SD 3.0); 53.3 % male; 30 % still on treatment) who participated in the psychosocial intervention, two dropped out due to medical complications and one due to lack of time; 90 % completed the psychosocial intervention. Overall, patients liked participation in the intervention (4.2 on a 5-point scale; SD 0.8) and were positive about the psychologists (8.1 on a 10-point scale; SD 1.3). Psychologists rated the intervention on several points (e.g., clarity of the manual and content of the intervention), and mean scores ranged from 7.1 (SD 1.1) to 8.6 (SD 0.9) on 10-point scales. Minor adaptations were suggested by patients and psychologists, including customizing according to age and a more patient-tailored approach.","This psychosocial intervention for childhood cancer patients appears to be applicable. Future studies need to establish whether this intervention combined with a physical exercise intervention actually improves psychosocial functioning of childhood cancer patients. When proven effective, this combined intervention can be offered to childhood cancer patients and may enhance their physical health and quality of life."
879,7695460,To compare three approaches for improving compliance with breast cancer screening in older women.,"Randomized controlled trial using three parallel group practices at a public hospital. Subjects included women aged 65 years and older (n = 803) who were seen by residents (n = 66) attending the ambulatory clinic from October 1, 1989, through March 31, 1990. All provider groups received intensive education in breast cancer screening. The control group received no further intervention. Staff in the second group offered education to patients at their visit. In addition, flowsheets were used in the &quot;Prevention Team&quot; group and staff had their tasks redefined to facilitate compliance.","Medical records were reviewed to determine documented offering/receipt of clinical breast examination and mammography. A subgroup of women without previous clinical breast examination (n = 540) and without previous mammography (n = 471) were analyzed to determine the effect of the intervention. During the intervention period, women without a previous clinical breast examination were offered an examination significantly more often in the Prevention Team group than in the control group, adjusting for age, race, and comorbidity and for physicians' gender and training level. The patients in the Prevention Team group were offered clinical breast examination (31.5%) more frequently than those in the patient education or control groups, but this was not significant after adjusting for the above covariates. Likewise, mammography was offered more frequently to patients in the Prevention Team and in the patient education group than to patients in the control group, after adjusting for the factors above using logistic regression.","The results provide support for patient education and organizational changes that involve nonphysician personnel to enhance breast cancer screening among older women, particularly those without previous screening."
880,10898562,"This paper describes the methods used in &quot;High 5,&quot; a school-based study to increase fruit and vegetable consumption for cancer risk reduction.","Twenty-eight elementary schools were matched and randomized to intervention or control conditions. All students were assessed based on diet and psychosocial variables at baseline and one and two years post-baseline. The intervention included classroom, parent, and environmental components.","The study recruited 1,698 families and retained 85%. The two conditions were equivalent at baseline; 50% female students, 81% to 84% European-American students, and 2.9 servings of fruit and vegetables per day. Good completion was achieved across the intervention components (e.g., 90% of lessons taught, 72% of parent materials read, 3.6 servings of fruit and vegetables offered in cafeterias).","The use of school-based programs, with strong evaluation designs, will enhance knowledge about the modification of nutrition behavior and cancer risk in children. Lessons learned from the study are reported."
881,15858816,"Although patients with cancer are often accompanied by a relative during medical interviews, to the authors' knowledge little is known regarding the efficacy of communication skills training programs on physicians' communication skills in this context. The objective of the current study was to assess the efficacy of 6 consolidation workshops, 3 hours in length, that were conducted after a 2.5-day basic training program.","After attending the basic training program, physicians were assigned randomly to consolidation workshops or to a waiting list. Training efficacy was assessed through simulated and actual interviews that were recorded on an audio tape at baseline, after consolidation workshops for the consolidation-workshops group, and 5 months after the end of basic training for the waiting-list group. Communication skills were assessed according to the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop Evaluation Manual. Patients' and relatives' perceptions of and satisfaction with physicians' communication performance were assessed using a 15-item questionnaire.","Sixty-two physicians completed the training program. Compared with physicians who participated to the basic training program, when addressing the patient, physicians who were randomized to the consolidation workshops used more open, open directive, and screening questions (P = 0.011 in simulated patient interviews and P = 0.005 in actual patient interviews) and elicited and clarified psychologic concerns more often (P = 0.006 in simulated patient interviews and P &lt; 0.001 in actual patient interviews). When they addressed the relative, physicians who were randomized to the consolidation workshops gave less premature information (P = 0.032 in simulated patient interviews and P &lt; 0.001 in actual patient interviews). When they addressed the patient and the relative simultaneously, physicians who were randomized to the consolidation workshops used more empathy, educated guesses, alerting to reality, confronting, negotiating, and summarizing (P = 0.003 in simulated patient interviews and P = 0.024 in actual patient interviews). Patients, but not relatives, who interacted with physicians in the consolidation-workshops group were more satisfied globally with the interviews (P = 0.022).",Six 3-hour consolidation workshops resulted in improved communication skills addressed to patients and to relatives. The current results showed that the transfer of skills addressing relatives' concerns remained limited and that consolidation workshops should focus even more systematically on the practice of three-person interviews.
882,21920206,"Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is commonly used to treat musculoskeletal pain, but it may also be indicated for postoperative analgesia. The objective of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effects of TENS on post-thoracotomy.","Thirty patients between 18 and 60 years of age undergoing thoracotomy for lung cancer resection on the second postoperative day were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups (G1 and G2). G1 patients were treated with TENS; and in G2 (without TENS) electrodes were placed but the equipment was not turned on. TENS was maintained for one hour. The visual analogue scale was used to evaluate the analgesic effects on three moments: before TENS (M0), immediately after TENS (M1), and one hour later (M2), with the patient at rest, elevation of the upper limbs, change in decubitus, and coughing.","The intensity of pain at rest was higher in G2 immediately after TENS, but not one hour after the procedure. There was no difference between both groups with elevation of the upper limbs, decubitus change, and coughing.","With the use of TENS for one hour on the second post-thoracotomy day in patients who received fentanyl (50 \u03bcg) associated with bupivacaine (5 mL), a reduction in pain intensity was observed at rest immediately after TENS; with elevation of the upper limbs, change in decubitus, and coughing, a reduction in pain severity was not observed."
883,29547610,"A cancer diagnosis is a serious stressor that is associated with anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and inability to fulfill daily routines. Many pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options are available to help patients with cancer manage anxiety.","This randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of lavender oil aromatherapy on anxiety and sleep quality in patients undergoing chemotherapy.","70 patients were randomly assigned to a lavender oil group, a tea tree oil group, and a control group with no oil. A patient identification form, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Pittsburgh Quality Sleep Index (PSQI) were used to measure anxiety and sleep quality before and after chemotherapy.","State anxiety before and after chemotherapy did not vary among groups. The authors compared trait anxiety values before and after chemotherapy and found a significant difference in the lavender group. In addition, a significant change in PSQI measurements before and after chemotherapy was observed."
884,10757272,"The effectiveness of traditional follow-up programs and the intensive search for disease progression in men with prostate cancer have been questioned. The aims of this randomized multi-centre study were to evaluate medical safety, patient satisfaction and resource utilization in an on-demand follow-up by a specialist nurse compared with traditional follow-up by a urologist.","Four hundred consecutively approached men with newly diagnosed or previously known prostate cancer in any stage at three hospitals in Sweden were randomized to follow-up in the nurse group (NG, 200 patients) or the urologist group (UG, 200 patients). In the NG, the nurse contacted the patient by phone every 6 months unless the patient himself initiated the contact. Patient satisfaction was evaluated twice a year via questionnaire. The questionnaire included the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The costs of all medical interventions and adverse events related to prostate cancer were calculated for all patients.","Medical safety, measured as complication frequency and lag time from symptoms to intervention, during the first 3 years of the observation period, was similar in the NG and the UG. The total number of interventions due to symptoms from prostate cancer was also similar in both groups. The analysis of accessibility and the HAD scale showed no significant differences between the groups. The mean outpatient cost (excluding pharmaceutical costs) per patient was lower in the NG compared to the UG, especially among patients without metastases at inclusion (37% lower cost).","Our study indicates that men with prostate cancer can be safely followed up by a specialist nurse. The study results show that this alternative follow-up is cost-effective, especially in men without metastases."
885,25939017,"Women with breast cancer (BCa) report elevated distress postsurgery. Group-based cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) following surgery improves psychological adaptation, though its key mechanisms remain speculative. This randomized controlled dismantling trial compared 2 interventions featuring elements thought to drive CBSM effects: a 5-week cognitive-behavioral training (CBT) and 5-week relaxation training (RT) versus a 5-week health education (HE) control group.","Women with stage 0-III BCa (N = 183) were randomized to CBT, RT, or HE condition 2-10 weeks postsurgery. Psychosocial measures were collected at baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2). Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) tested whether CBT and RT treatments improved primary measures of psychological adaptation and secondary measures of stress management resource perceptions from pre- to postintervention relative to HE.","Both CBT and RT groups reported reduced depressive affect. The CBT group reported improved emotional well-being/quality of life and less cancer-specific thought intrusions. The RT group reported improvements on illness-related social disruption. Regarding stress management resources, the CBT group reported increased reliability of social support networks, while the RT group reported increased confidence in relaxation skills. Psychological adaptation and stress management resource constructs were unchanged in the HE control group.","Nonmetastatic breast cancer patients participating in 2 forms of brief, 5-week group-based stress management intervention after surgery showed improvements in psychological adaptation and stress management resources compared with an attention-matched control group. Findings provide preliminary support suggesting that using brief group-based stress management interventions may promote adaptation among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients."
886,15199111,"Clinical trials have shown that calcium supplementation modestly decreases the risk of colorectal adenomas. However, few studies have examined the effect of calcium on the risk of different types of colorectal lesions or dietary determinants of this effect.","Our analysis used patients from the Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial among patients with a recent colorectal adenoma. Nine hundred thirty patients were randomly assigned to calcium carbonate (1200 mg/day) or placebo. Follow-up colonoscopies were conducted approximately 1 and 4 years after the qualifying examination. We used general estimating equation (GEE) and generalized linear regression analyses to compute risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the effect of calcium treatment versus placebo on the risk of hyperplastic polyps, tubular adenomas, and more advanced lesions. Additionally, we used GEE analyses to compare the calcium treatment effects for various types of polyps with that for tubular adenomas. We also examined the interaction between calcium treatment and baseline intake of dietary calcium, fat, and fiber. All P values were obtained using Wald tests based on the corresponding models. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.","The calcium risk ratio for hyperplastic polyps was 0.82 (95% CI = 0.67 to 1.00), that for tubular adenomas was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.77 to 1.03), and that for histologically advanced neoplasms was 0.65 (95% CI = 0.46 to 0.93) compared with patients assigned to placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between the risk ratio for tubular adenomas and that for other types of polyps. The effect of calcium supplementation on adenoma risk was most pronounced among individuals with high dietary intakes of calcium and fiber and with low intake of fat, but the interactions were not statistically significant.",Our results suggest that calcium supplementation may have a more pronounced antineoplastic effect on advanced colorectal lesions than on other types of polyps.
887,12610195,The aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of antioxidant supplementation with vitamin E in patients treated with cisplatin chemotherapy.,"Between April 1999 and October 2000, forty-seven patients were randomly assigned to either group one, which received vitamin E supplementation during cisplatin chemotherapy, or to group two, which received cisplatin chemotherapy alone. Alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E; 300 mg/d) was administered orally before cisplatin chemotherapy and continued for 3 months after the suspension of treatment. For preclinical studies, nude mice carrying the human melanoma tumor were treated with cisplatin alone or in combination with vitamin E.","Twenty-seven patients completed six cycles of cisplatin chemotherapy: 13 patients in group one and 14 patients in group two. The incidence of neurotoxicity was significantly lower in group one (30.7%) than it was in group two (85.7%; P &lt;.01). The severity of neurotoxicity, measured with a comprehensive neurotoxicity score based on clinical and neurophysiological parameters, was significantly lower in patients who were supplemented with vitamin E than in patients who were not supplemented with vitamin E (2 v 4.7, P &lt;.01). The results of the preclinical studies showed that when cisplatin was combined with vitamin E, no differences were observed in tumor weight inhibition, tumor growth delay, or life span as compared with treatment with cisplatin alone.",Supplementation of patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy with vitamin E decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral neurotoxicity.
888,12772189,"Prostate cancer is the most common solid-tumor cancer in US males but is rare in Asian males. When Asian men adopt the US lifestyle, clinical prostate cancer increases greatly. Epidemiological data from men in the US indicate that regular activity may reduce the risk for prostate cancer.","Serum was obtained from three groups of similar-aged men, Control, Diet and Exercise, and Exercise alone were used to stimulate LNCaP cells in culture. Growth and apoptosis of tumor cells were measured. Serum samples were also used to measure insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-1.",The Diet and Exercise and the Exercise alone groups had lower serum insulin and IGF-1 but higher IGFBP-1 compared to Controls. LNCaP cell growth was reduced in both groups compared to Control and there was a major increase in apoptosis of tumor cells.,A low-fat diet and/or intensive exercise results in change in serum hormones and growth factors in vivo that can reduce growth and induce apoptosis of LNCaP prostate tumor cells in vitro.
889,16294343,The majority of prostate carcinoma survivors experience enduring sexual difficulties and associated distress in the years after definitive treatment. A counseling intervention aimed at improving levels of sexual satisfaction and increasing successful utilization of medical treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED) was developed and pilot-tested for both the survivor of prostate carcinoma and his partner.,"All male participants were 3-month to 5-year survivors of localized prostate carcinoma who had been treated with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, and were married or in a committed relationship. Couples were randomized to attend four sessions of counseling together or to have the man attend alone. In both groups, partners completed behavioral homework. The sessions included education on prostate carcinoma and sexual function and options to treat ED as well as sexual communication and stimulation skills. Standardized questionnaires at baseline, posttreatment, and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up assessed sexual function, marital adjustment, psychologic distress, and utilization of treatments for ED.","Fifty-one of 84 couples randomized to treatment completed the intervention (61%). Attendance by the partner did not affect outcomes. Participants completing the intervention demonstrated improvement in male overall distress (P &lt; 0.01), male global sexual function (P &lt; 0.0001), and female global sexual function (P &lt; 0.05) at 3-month follow-up, but regression toward baseline was noted at 6-month follow-up. However, utilization of ED treatments increased from 31% at the time of study entry to 49% at the 6-month follow-up (P = 0.003).","The results of this brief pilot counseling intervention demonstrated significant gains in sexual function and satisfaction and increased utilization of treatments for ED. However, modifications are needed in future randomized trials to reduce the rate of premature termination and to improve long-term maintenance of gains."
890,17351987,"Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety, with fatigue as the most prevalent symptom of those undergoing treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether improvement in depression, anxiety or fatigue during chemotherapy following anthroposophy art therapy intervention is substantial enough to warrant a controlled trial.","Sixty cancer patients on chemotherapy and willing to participate in once-weekly art therapy sessions (painting with water-based paints) were accrued for the study. Nineteen patients who participated in &gt; or =4 sessions were evaluated as the intervention group, and 41 patients who participated in &lt; or =2 sessions comprised the participant group. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) were completed before every session, relating to the previous week.","BFI scores were higher in the participant group (p=0.06). In the intervention group, the median HADS score for depression was 9 at the beginning and 7 after the fourth appointment (p=0.021). The median BFI score changed from 5.7 to 4.1 (p=0.24). The anxiety score was in the normal range from the beginning.",Anthroposophical art therapy is worthy of further study in the treatment of cancer patients with depression or fatigue during chemotherapy treatment.
891,27842926,"Patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal surgery often eat poorly post-operatively, despite dietetic input. A pilot study was conducted to examine the benefit of a 6 week nutritional supplementation via a feeding jejunostomy on fatigue, quality of life and independent living.","A feeding jejunostomy was placed routinely at oesophagectomy or total gastrectomy for cancer. At discharge, patients were randomised to nutritional supplementation (600\u00a0kcal/day) via their feeding jejunostomies or no jejunal supplement. Patients were assessed at discharge and 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks following discharge for fatigue (MFI-20), quality of life (QLQ-OES18), health economic analysis (EQ5D) as well as completing a two-day dietary diary.","44 patients (M:F, 29:15) were randomised, 23 received jejunal supplements. There were no differences between the groups. Percentage of calculated energy requirement received was greater in the supplemented group at weeks 3 and 6 (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001). Oral energy intake was not different between the groups at any time period. After hospital discharge, there were no differences in MFI-20, EQ5D and QLQ-OES18 scores at any time point. From hospital discharge fatigue improved and plateaued at 6 weeks (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05 for both groups), independence at 12 weeks (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05 for both groups).

892,12394349,A randomized trial was conducted to test the effects of two counseling methods (genetic counseling and group counseling) against a control no-intervention condition on interest in genetic testing in lower risk women.,"After completing baseline surveys, women (N = 357) were randomized to one of three conditions: to receive individual genetic risk counseling, to receive a group psychosocial group counseling, or to serve as a control group. Participants completed follow-up questionnaires 6 months after randomization.","All participants had some familial history of breast cancer, but none had a family history indicative of autosomal dominant genetic mutation. At baseline over three fourths of the sample judged themselves to be appropriate candidates for testing. By the end of the survey, two thirds (70%) of the women in the counseling group still judged themselves to be appropriate candidates for testing. Findings were similar for interest in genetic testing. Changes in beliefs about genetic testing (e.g., beliefs about potential stigma associated with testing) altered the effects of counseling.",These results indicate that counseling can change interest in genetic testing only slightly and that changing women's beliefs about the properties of testing might be one mechanism of doing so.
893,16170170,"Previous studies suggest that diet may affect recurrence or survival rates in women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between plasma carotenoid concentration, as a biomarker of vegetable and fruit intake, and risk for a new breast cancer event in a cohort of women with a history of early-stage breast cancer.","Participants were 1,551 women previously treated for breast cancer who were randomly assigned to the control arm of a diet intervention trial between March 1995 and November 2000. Outcome events were probed during semiannual interviews and verified by medical record review. During the period under study, 205 women had a recurrence or new primary breast cancer. Plasma carotenoid concentrations were measured in baseline blood samples. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs by quartiles of plasma carotenoids were computed, controlling for tumor stage, grade, and hormone receptor status; chemotherapy and tamoxifen therapy; clinical site; age at diagnosis; body mass index; and plasma cholesterol concentration.","Women in the highest quartile of plasma total carotenoid concentration had significantly reduced risk for a new breast cancer event (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.89), controlled for covariates influencing breast cancer prognosis.","Plasma carotenoids are a biologic marker of intake of vegetables and fruit, so this observation supports findings from previous studies that have linked increased vegetable and fruit intake with greater likelihood of recurrence-free survival in women who have been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer."
894,9817287,"Patients with cancer and chronic inflammatory disorders have used shark cartilage (SC) preparations for many years. Preclinical studies that support their beneficial effects are scanty, and reports of clinical trials have been anecdotal. The proposed mechanisms of antitumor action include direct or indirect inhibition of angiogenesis. Because of the emerging use of SC as an alternative to conventional cancer therapy, this trial was launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SC.","Sixty adult patients with advanced previously treated cancer (breast, 16 patients; colorectal, 16 patients; lung, 14 patients; prostate, eight patients; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, three patients; brain, one patient; and unknown primary tumor, two patients) were enrolled. Eligibility criteria included confirmation of diagnosis, resistance to conventional therapy, objective measurable disease, life expectancy of 12 weeks or greater, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, no recent or concomitant anticancer therapy, no prior SC, and informed consent. Patients underwent evaluation of the extent of disease, quality-of-life score (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G] scale), and hematologic, biochemical, and selected immune function studies at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of SC therapy. The dose of SC was 1 g/kg daily orally in three divided doses. Standard criteria were used to evaluate adverse events and response.","Ten of 60 patients were lost to follow-up(LTFU) or refused further treatment (RFT) before the 6-week evaluation and were not assessable for toxicity and response. Three patients with stable disease at 6 weeks were LTFU or RFT thereafter. Of the 47 fully assessable patients, five were taken off study because of gastrointestinal toxicity or intolerance to SC. Progressive disease (PD) at 6 or 12 weeks occurred in 22 and five patients, respectively. Five patients died of PD while undergoing SC therapy. No complete (CRs) or partial responses (PRs) were noted. Median time to tumor progression in the entire study population was 7+/-9.7 weeks (mean, 11.4 weeks; range, 3.7 to 45.7 weeks). Ten (20%) of 50 assessable patients, or 16.7% of the 60 intent-to-treat patients, had stable disease (SD) for 12 weeks or more. The median time to tumor progression was 27 weeks, the mean was 28.8+/-9.9 weeks, and the range was 18.6 to 45.7 weeks. In this subset, FACT-G scores improved in four patients, were unchanged in four patients, and declined in two patients. Twenty-one adverse events (grade 1, eight events; grade 2, seven events; and grade 3, six events) were recorded, 14 of which were gastroenterologic (nausea, vomiting, constipation).","Under the specific conditions of this study, SC as a single agent was inactive in patients with advanced-stage cancer and had no salutary effect on quality of life. The 16.7% rate of SD was similar to results in patients with advanced cancer treated with supportive care alone."
895,12759389,"In two large, randomized prevention trials, supplementation with beta-carotene increased the risk of lung cancer. Subjects in these studies were predominantly cigarette smokers, and the adverse effects were concentrated among those who also drank alcohol. Although beta-carotene supplementation appeared not to increase the risk of cancer generally, it is not clear if smoking and/or alcohol use alters the effect of beta-carotene on carcinogenesis at sites outside the lung.","We studied the effect of beta-carotene supplementation on colorectal adenoma recurrence among subjects in a multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of antioxidants for the prevention of colorectal adenomas. A total of 864 subjects who had had an adenoma removed and were polyp-free were randomly assigned (in a factorial design) to receive beta-carotene (25 mg or placebo) and/or vitamins C and E in combination (1000 mg and 400 mg, respectively, or placebo), and were followed with colonoscopy for adenoma recurrence 1 year and 4 years after the qualifying endoscopy. A total of 707 subjects had two follow-up examinations and provided smoking and alcohol use data. Adjusted multivariate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the effects of beta-carotene on adenoma recurrence.","Among subjects who neither smoked cigarettes nor drank alcohol, beta-carotene was associated with a marked decrease in the risk of one or more recurrent adenomas (RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.89), but beta-carotene supplementation conferred a modest increase in the risk of recurrence among those who smoked (RR = 1.36, 95% CI = 0.70 to 2.62) or drank (RR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.43). For participants who smoked cigarettes and also drank more than one alcoholic drink per day, beta-carotene doubled the risk of adenoma recurrence (RR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.39 to 3.08; P for difference from nonsmoker/nondrinker RR &lt;.001).",Alcohol intake and cigarette smoking appear to modify the effect of beta-carotene supplementation on the risk of colorectal adenoma recurrence.
896,25543421,To compare the efficacy difference in treatment of depression in breast cancer between the combined therapy of acupuncture and auricular acupressure and western medication.,"Sixty patients were randomized into an observation group and a control group, 30 cases in each one. In the observation group, the combined therapy of acupuncture and auricular acupressure was adopted. The main acupoints of acupuncture were Hegu (LI 4), Tai-chong (LR 3), Baihui (GV 20), Zusanli (ST 36), Qihai (CV 6), etc. The supplementary acupoints were combined according to the syndrome differentiation. The treatment was given once every day, 5 treatments a week, at the interval of 2 days among weeks. The auricular acupressure was applied to gan (CO12, liver), pi (CO13, spleen), neifenmi (CO18, endocrine), etc., once every 4 days, on each side in one treatment. In the control group, fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules were prescribed for oral administration, 20 mg, once a day. The Hamilton depression rating scale (HAMD) was used to assess the disease severity and efficacy before treatment, in 4 and 8 weeks of treatment separately. HAMD factor changes were observed before treatment and at the end of the 8th week. The Asberg antidepressants scale (SERS) was applied to safety assessment.","The total effective rate was 86.7% (26/30) in the observation group, better than 63.3% (19/30) in the control group (P&lt;0.05). At the end of the 4th and 8th weeks, HAMD scores were all reduced apparently in the two groups (all P&lt;0.01). At the end of the 8th week, the scores of the HAMD factor 1 (anxiety/somatic system), factor 5 (retardation) and factor 6 (sleep disturbance) were all reduced as compared with those before treatment in the two groups (all P&lt;0.01); the results in the observation group were better than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01). SERS score in the observation group was lower obviously than that in the control group (P&lt;0.01).",The combined therapy of acupuncture and auricular acupressure achieves the antidepression effect in treatment of depression in breast cancer and has less side effects and high safety. The efficacy is superior to fluoxetine hydrochloride capsules.
897,22573338,The aim of this study is to evaluate a 12-week social cognitive theory (SCT)-based email intervention designed to influence the physical activity of survivors of breast cancer.,"Seventy-four volunteers (intervention group, n\u2009=\u200936; control group, n\u2009=\u200938) were recruited by mass email and written letter solicitation. Participants completed a series of online questionnaires measuring demographic characteristics, physical activity readiness, level of physical activity and selected SCT variables at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. The intervention group received email messages based on SCT designed specifically for breast cancer survivors and targeting physical activity. For the first 6 weeks of the intervention, participants assigned to the intervention group received messages weekly, from weeks 7 to 12, participants received messages every other week and had access to an e-counselor. The control group did not receive email messages, nor did they have access to an e-counselor.",Significant differences in levels of self-reported vigorous physical activity were found between groups at 6 and 12 weeks. Significant differences were also found for self-reported moderate physical activity at 12 weeks.,Email-based interventions based on SCT can significantly influence levels of self-reported physical activity of breast cancer survivors.
898,11164130,"There is increasing evidence that vitamin E (primarily alpha- and gamma-tocopherol) may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers, therefore it is important to understand factors that influence blood levels.","The correlates of serum alpha- and gamma-tocopherol were investigated among participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a 40-site disease prevention trial. Subjects were 1047 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years, who provided fasting blood specimens and detailed information on diet, supplement use, and other factors at entry to the study (1994-96).","Total serum cholesterol and triglycerides were highly correlated with serum alpha- and gamma-tocopherol concentrations and were controlled for in all analyses along with age, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). Alpha and gamma-tocopherol were strongly negatively correlated (partial r = -0.69). The strongest predictor of serum tocopherols was average daily intake of vitamin E from supplements (partial r = 0.60 for alpha, r = -0.54 for gamma). Other factors associated with increased alpha- and/or decreased gamma-tocopherol concentrations were serum retinol and carotenoids, supplemental vitamin C, alpha-tocopherol intake from food, dietary fiber, and Hispanic ethnicity. Factors associated with lower alpha- and/or higher gamma-tocopherol concentrations included gamma-tocopherol intake from food, total fat intake, and BMI. Age, income, hormone use, and geographic location were &quot;spuriously&quot; associated with serum tocopherol levels through their association with supplement use, i.e., there was no such association among the subset of women not taking supplements.","Vitamin E intake from supplements and BMI are the major independent predictors of serum tocopherol levels in women, whereas dietary factors only play a small role."
899,18306372,"Exercise training improves supportive care outcomes in patients with breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant therapy, but the responses are heterogeneous. In this study, the authors examined personal and clinical factors that may predict exercise training responses.","Breast cancer patients who were initiating adjuvant chemotherapy (N=242) were assigned randomly to receive usual care (UC) (n=82), resistance exercise training (RET) (n=82), or aerobic exercise training (AET) (n=78) for the duration of chemotherapy. Endpoints were quality of life (QoL), aerobic fitness, muscular strength, lean body mass, and body fat. Moderators were patient preference for group assignment, marital status, age, disease stage, and chemotherapy regimen.","Adjusted linear mixed-model analyses demonstrated that patient preference moderated QoL response (P= .005). Patients who preferred RET improved QoL when they were assigned to receive RET compared with UC (mean difference, 16.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 4.3-28.7; P= .008) or AET (mean difference, 11; 95% CI, -1.1-23.4; P= .076). Patients who had no preference had improved QoL when they were assigned to receive AET compared with RET (mean difference, 23; 95% CI, 4.9-41; P= .014). Marital status also moderated QoL response (P= .026), age moderated aerobic fitness response (P= .029), chemotherapy regimen moderated strength gain (P= .009), and disease stage moderated both lean body mass gain (P&lt; .001) and fat loss (P= .059). Unmarried, younger patients who were receiving nontaxane-based therapies and had more advanced disease stage experienced better outcomes. The findings were not explained by differences in adherence.","Patient preference, demographic variables, and medical variables moderated the effects of exercise training in breast cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy. If replicated, these results may inform clinical practice."
900,22237121,"Primary lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. It causes great pain and mood disorders to patients, and significantly reduces their quality of life. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effect of Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver combined with psychotherapy on quality of life (QoL) and physical status of patients with primary lung cancer.","A total of 118 patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer were randomly divided into two groups. The 57 patients in the combined therapy group were treated with Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver and psychotherapy combined with chemotherapy, whereas the 61 patients in the control group were treated with chemotherapy only. Both groups were observed for the two treatment courses. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QoL Questionnaire LC-43 (EORTC QLQ-LC43) was used to assess the QoL of every patient in both groups before and after treatment scales. At the same time, physical status was assessed using the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and East Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG).","The scores of physiology function, role function, emotion function, cognize function, society function, and general health in the therapy group were higher than that of the control group. The therapy group also showed better QoL results than the contol group. Significant differences were observed between the two groups (P&lt;0.01). Meanwhile, the scores of fatigue, vomit, pain, polypnea, insomnia, anorexia, constipation, and specific manifestation of lung cancer in the therapy group were obviously lower than that of the control group; more patients were observed to be relieved. Significant differences between the two groups were observed (P&lt;0.01). The KPS and ECOG scores of the patients were observed to have improved and stabilized in the therapy group than that of the control group; the differences were statistically significant (P&lt;0.01).","Feiji Decoction for soothing the liver combined with psychotherapy can alleviate the clinical symptoms, elevate the physical status, and improve the QOL of patients with primary lung cancer. Thus, this therapy has a good clinical therapeutic effect."
901,17357326,"Malnutrition occurs in ca. 60% of all patients with gastric cancer. The obligatory standard for a curative radical oncological procedure is gastrectomy inclusive of regional lymph nodes. Nutritional treatment is expected to decrease possibilities of postoperative complications in patients subjected to curative surgery. The study is aimed at comparing treatment results in patients with gastric cancer subjected to radical surgery, nutritional and non-nutritional treatment respectively.","The study included 176 patients qualified for curative surgery of a total or subtotal gastrectomy. Analysed were 2 groups of patients: group I--not subjected to nutritional treatment, group II--subjected to nutritional treatment, both in the circumoperative period. The groups were compared in respect to: 1) age, 2) sex, 3) nutritional condition, 4) degree of clinical cancer development, 5) histopathological cancer type, 6) kind of surgical procedure performed, 7) antibiotic and antithrombotic prevention. All complications observed in the patients were divided into four kinds: surgical of a high or low risk and general of a high or low risk.","Given the above-mentioned estimation parameters, no statistically significant differences between both groups were recorded. Of 176 patients, 27% showed surgical complications and 40% had general complications. No difference (p = 0.60) in the incidence of a high and low risk surgical complications between groups I and II in the circumoperative period was observed, a significant difference (p = 0.03) was recorded in the incidence of general complications. Low risk general complications (respiratory infections) were shown to occur significantly more often (p = 0.005) in patients receiving either parenteral or enteral nutrition after surgery.","A significant part of the patients with a medium degree and a medium to heavy degree of malnutrition subjected to a curative gastrectomy can pass through the postoperative period without using either parenteral or enteral nutrition and with no violations of all the other principles of the postoperative procedure as well as without provoking any significant increase of surgical complications. In case surgical complications should occur and delay resuming natural feeding, it is necessary that parenteral and/or enteral nutritional treatment be undertaken according to clinical circumstances and condition of the patient concerned; such proceedings increase chances of cure."
902,29315168,The purpose of this study was to explore whether methods adapted from oncology pharmacological trials have utility in reporting adherence (tolerability) of exercise treatment in cancer.,"Using a retrospective analysis of a randomized trial, 25 prostate cancer patients received an aerobic training regimen of 72 supervised treadmill walking sessions delivered thrice weekly between 55% and 100% of exercise capacity for 24 consecutive weeks. Treatment adherence (tolerability) was assessed using conventional (lost to follow-up and attendance) and exploratory (e.g., permanent discontinuation, dose modification, and relative dose intensity) outcomes.","The mean total cumulative &quot;planned&quot; and &quot;completed&quot; dose was 200.7 \u00b1 47.6 and 153.8 \u00b1 68.8 MET\u00b7h, respectively, equating to a mean relative dose intensity of 77% \u00b1 24%. Two patients (8%) were lost to follow-up, and mean attendance was 79%. A total of 6 (24%) of 25 patients permanently discontinued aerobic training before week 24. Aerobic training was interrupted (missing \u22653 consecutive sessions) or dose reduced in a total of 11 (44%) and 24 (96%) patients, respectively; a total 185 (10%) of 1800 training sessions required dose reduction owing to both health-related (all nonserious) and non-health-related adverse events. Eighteen (72%) patients required at least one session to be terminated early; a total of 59 (3%) sessions required early termination.",Novel methods for the conduct and reporting of exercise treatment adherence and tolerability may provide important information beyond conventional metrics in patients with cancer.
903,29136682,"Psychosocial interventions are historically underutilized by cancer caregivers, but support programs delivered flexibly over the Internet address multiple barriers to care. We adapted Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for cancer caregivers, an in-person psychotherapeutic intervention intended to augment caregivers' sense of meaning and purpose and ameliorate burden, for delivery in a self-administered web-based program, the Care for the Cancer Caregiver (CCC) Workshop. The present study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of this program.","Eighty-four caregivers were randomized to the CCC Workshop or waitlist control arm. Quantitative assessments of meaning, burden, anxiety, depression, benefit finding, and spiritual well-being were conducted preintervention (T1), within 2-weeks postintervention (T2), and 2- to 3-month follow-up (T3). In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with a subset of participants.","Forty-two caregivers were randomized to the CCC Workshop. Attrition was moderate at T2 and T3, with caregiver burden and bereavement as key causes of drop-out. At T2 and T3, some observed mean change scores and effect sizes were consistent with hypothesized trends (eg, meaning in caregiving, benefit finding, and depressive symptomatology), though no pre-post significant differences emerged between groups. However, a longitudinal mixed-effects model found significant differential increases in benefit finding in favor of the CCC arm.","The CCC Workshop was feasible and acceptable. Based on effect sizes reported here, a larger study will likely establish the efficacy of the CCC Workshop, which has the potential to address unmet needs of caregivers who underutilize in-person supportive care services."
904,25828172,"To assess the efficacy of cognitive existential couple therapy (CECT) for relationship function, coping, cancer distress and mental health in men with localised prostate cancer and in their partners.","A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 62 couples randomly assigned to the six-session CECT programme or care as usual. The couple's relationship function (primary outcome), and coping, cancer distress and mental health (secondary outcomes) were evaluated at T0 (baseline), T1 (after treatment) and T2 (9 months from T0). A repeated-measures analysis of covariance model, which incorporated T0 measurements as a covariate, was used to compare treatment groups at T1 and T2.","After CECT, patients reported significantly greater use of adaptive coping (P = 0.03) and problem-focused coping (P = 0.01). These gains were maintained at follow-up, while relationship cohesion had improved (P = 0.03), as had relationship function for younger patients (P = 0.01). Younger partners reported less cancer-specific distress (P = 0.008), avoidance (P = 0.04), intrusive thought (P = 0.006), and hyperarousal (P = 0.01). Gains were maintained at follow-up, while relationship cohesion (P = 0.007), conflict resolution (P = 0.01) and relational function (P = 0.009) all improved.","CECT resulted in improved coping for patients and lower cancer-distress for partners. Maintained over time this manifests as improved relationship function. CECT was acceptable to couples, alleviated long-term relationship decline, and is therefore suitable as a preventative mental health intervention for couples facing prostate cancer. Given resourcing demands, we recommend dissemination of CECT be targeted at younger couples, as CECT was more acceptable to the younger group, and they derived greater benefit from it."
905,28150044,The worst-case scenario (WCS) exercise is part of a manualized cognitive-existential group intervention for fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). It requires cancer survivors to describe the scenario they most fear when they think about the possibility of their cancer returning and to re-read the scenario daily for 1\u00a0week as homework. The purpose of this study was to present this novel clinical treatment for FCR and to examine whether at-home repeated exposure to the WCS was related to pre- and post-therapy FCR levels.,Women with breast and gynaecological cancers who received care at The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre were recruited to participate in this follow-up study. Consenting participants provided copies of their WCS exercises.,The WCS of ten female cancer survivors were collected to examine the homework portion of the exercise. Higher adherence to homework was significantly related to lower post-therapy FCR but not to pre-therapy scores.,"Baseline levels of FCR may not be a factor influencing inter-session homework adherence to the WCS, while exposure to the WCS resulting from adherence to the homework exercise may influence post-therapy FCR outcomes. These effects remain to be differentiated from the overall therapeutic effect of the 6-week cognitive-existential intervention for FCR, using a larger sample. This study presents preliminary evidence for an upcoming multi-centre trial in which the WCS exercise will be re-examined with larger sample sizes."
906,11054432,PC-SPES is an herbal supplement for which there are anecdotal reports of anti-prostate cancer activity. This phase II study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and toxicity of PC-SPES in prostate cancer patients.,Thirty-three patients with androgen-dependent prostate cancer (ADPCa) and 37 patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPCa) were treated with PC-SPES at a dose of nine capsules daily. Clinical outcome was assessed with serial serum prostate-specific androgen (PSA) level measurement and imaging studies.,"One hundred percent of ADPCa patients experienced a PSA decline of &gt;/= 80%, with a median duration of 57+ weeks. No patient has developed PSA progression. Thirty-one patients (97%) had declines of testosterone to the anorchid range. Two ADPCa patients had positive bone scans; both improved. One patient with a bladder mass measurable on computed tomography scan experienced disappearance of this mass. Nineteen (54%) of 35 AIPCa patients had a PSA decline of &gt;/= 50%, including eight (50%) of 16 patients who had received prior ketoconazole therapy. Median time to PSA progression was 16 weeks (range, 2 to 69+ weeks). Of 25 patients with positive bone scans, two had improvement, seven had stable disease, 11 had progressive disease, and five did not have a repeat bone scan because of PSA progression. Severe toxicities included thromboembolic events (n = 3) and allergic reactions (n = 3). Other frequent toxicities included gynecomastia/gynecodynia, leg cramps, and grade 1 or 2 diarrhea.",PC-SPES seems to have activity in the treatment of both ADPCa and AIPCa and has acceptable toxicity. Further study is required to determine whether its effects exceed those expected with estrogen therapy.
907,16260434,"To report initial feasibility and outcome from a pilot study of a new three-session intervention for caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer, Surviving Cancer Competently Intervention Program-Newly Diagnosed (SCCIP-ND).","Nineteen families (38 caregivers) were randomly assigned to SCCIP-ND or treatment as usual subsequent to learning of their child's illness. The study design included pre- and 2-month postintervention assessments, with state anxiety and posttraumatic stress symptoms as outcomes. Feasibility was based on therapist feedback and supervision, program evaluations, and data from study-tracking procedures.","SCCIP-ND appears to be an acceptable intervention that can be used successfully with caregivers over the first few months after diagnosis. Recruitment and retention data document feasibility but also highlight challenges. Preliminary outcome data show changes in the desired direction [e.g., reduced anxiety and parental posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)].",The pilot data are supportive of the value and challenges of developing evidence-based family interventions in pediatric psychology.
908,16999640,"Women with a family history of breast cancer have several menopausal therapy options, including tamoxifen, hormone therapy (HT), alternative medications, or no treatment. This complex decision should be based on each woman's risk to develop breast cancer, menopausal symptoms, preferences, and risks for other conditions. The authors determined the effects of a personalized risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention on knowledge, risk perception, and decision making in a group of healthy women who had a first-degree relative with breast cancer.","Forty-eight cancer-free menopausal women age &gt; or =40 years who had at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer were randomized to a genetic counseling intervention or control. Intervention participants were given a personalized risk assessment for breast cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, and uterine cancer based on family history and personal health data. Knowledge, risk perception, and medication usage were measured at baseline, 1 month, and 6 months.","Knowledge was higher in the intervention group at both follow-up time points postintervention. Perceived risk for developing breast cancer was significantly lower and more accurate in the intervention group at 1 and 6 months postintervention than at baseline, as was perceived risk of developing heart disease. Although the counseling intervention did affect both knowledge and risk perception, overall, both groups were reluctant to take any form of menopausal therapy.","A personalized risk assessment and genetic counseling intervention improves patient knowledge and risk perception; however, it is unclear that the intervention influenced menopausal treatment decisions."
909,8475011,Efforts to detect breast cancer in its early stages are necessary to reduce breast cancer-associated mortality. This study evaluated the impact of a multicomponent intervention implemented between 1987 and 1990 to increase a community's utilization of breast cancer screening by women over 50 years of age.,"The study used a pretest/post-test two-community design, with one community assigned as the intervention community and the other as the comparison. The intervention consisted of a comprehensive physician involvement component and a community education effort. To assess the overall impact of the interventions, we measured women's participation in screening via random digit dial telephone surveys at three time points, each approximately 18 months apart.","Over the course of the study, there were dramatic improvements in breast cancer screening participation in both communities. However, the intervention city showed more improvement in selected variables than did the comparison community in the early phases of the project between baseline and midpoint. These included increased advice by physicians to have mammograms, increased awareness that screening is necessary in the absence of symptoms, increased awareness that many women over 50 have mammograms, decreased perception of barriers to clinical breast exam, and an increase in the proportion of women having a clinical breast exam. In addition, significantly fewer women in the intervention city than in the comparison city reported never having had a mammogram at midpoint.","The findings demonstrate limited impact of a community intervention during a period of increasing adoption of mammography screening, in part, due to this rapidly rising secular trend. Additionally, increased activities in the comparison community were documented. Therefore, as incidence of screening increases, targeted activities aimed at population subgroups are warranted, and evaluation designs need to include multiple comparison groups or broader geographic random samples."
910,23282113,"The prevalence of sleep disturbance is high among cancer patients, and the sleep problems tend to last for years after the end of treatment. As part of a large randomized controlled clinical trial (the MICA trial, NCT00990977) of the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on psychological and somatic symptoms among breast cancer patients, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of MBSR on the secondary outcome, 'sleep quality'.","A total of 336 women operated on for breast cancer stage I-III 3-18 months previously were randomized to MBSR (n = 168) or treatment as usual (n = 168); both groups received standard clinical care. The intervention consisted of an eight-week MBSR program (psycho-education, meditation and gentle yoga). Sleep quality was assessed on the Medical Outcome Study sleep scale at baseline, after the intervention and at six- and 12-months' follow-up.","The mean sleep problem scores were significantly lower in the MBSR group than in controls immediately after the intervention. Quantile regression analyses showed that the effect was statistically significant only for the participants represented by the lower percentile of change between baseline and post-intervention, i.e. those who had more sleep problems; the MBSR group had a significantly smaller increase in sleep problems than the control group. After the 12-month follow-up, there was no significant between-group effect of MBSR on sleep quality in intention-to-treat analyses.",MBSR had a statistically significant effect on sleep quality just after the intervention but no long-term effect among breast cancer patients. Future trials in which participation is restricted to patients with significant sleep problems are recommended for evaluating the effect of MBSR on sleep quality.
911,9445198,"The aim of the current prospective, randomized control study was to investigate the effect of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids plus vitamin E on the immune status and survival of well-nourished and malnourished patients with generalized malignancy.","Sixty patients with generalized solid tumors were randomized to receive dietary supplementation with either fish oil (18 g of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFA) or placebo daily until death. Each group included 15 well-nourished and 15 malnourished patients. The authors measured total T cells, T-helper cells, T-suppressor cells, natural killer cells, and the synthesis of interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor by peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and on Day 40 of fish oil supplementation. Karnofsky performance status, nutritional state, and survival were also estimated.","The ratio of T-helper cells to T-suppressor cells was significantly lower in malnourished patients. Omega-3 PUFA had a considerable immunomodulating effect by increasing this ratio in the subgroup of malnourished patients. There were no significant differences in cytokine production among the various groups, except for a decrease in tumor necrosis factor production in malnourished cancer patients, which was restored by omega-3 fatty acids. The mean survival was significantly higher for the subgroup of well-nourished patients in both groups, whereas omega-3 fatty acids prolonged the survival of all the patients.",Malnutrition appears to be an important predictor of survival for patients with end stage malignant disease. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids had a significant immunomodulating effect and seemed to prolong the survival of malnourished patients with generalized malignancy.
912,11689579,"To determine whether making patient-reported cancer needs, quality-of-life (QOL), and psychosocial information available to the health care team, allowing coordinated specifically targeted psychosocial interventions, resulted in reduced cancer needs, improved QOL, and increased satisfaction with care received.","Self-reported cancer needs, QOL, and psychosocial information was collected from 450 people with cancer, using standardized questionnaires via a touch-screen computer. For a randomly chosen two thirds, this information was made available to the health care team who coordinated targeted psychosocial interventions. Information from the remaining one third was not seen. Patients were assessed 2 and 6 months after randomization for changes in their cancer needs, QOL, and psychosocial functioning and satisfaction with overall care received.","There were no significant differences between the two arms with respect to changes in cancer needs, QOL, or psychosocial functioning between the baseline and follow-up assessments, nor with respect to satisfaction with care. However, for the subgroup of patients who were moderately or severely depressed at baseline, there was a significant reduction in depression for the intervention arm relative to the control arm at the 6-month assessment (P =.001).","Making patient-reported cancer needs, QOL, and psychosocial data available to the health care team at a single consultation together with coordinated psychosocial interventions does not seem to reduce cancer needs nor improve QOL, psychosocial functioning, or satisfaction with the care received. However, identification of patients with moderate or severe levels of depression may be valuable in reducing subsequent levels of depression."
913,15533901,Several epidemiologic studies have described protective effects of soy consumption against breast cancer. The goal of this trial among premenopausal women was to examine the effect of soy foods on menstrual cycle length and circulating sex hormone levels.,"This 2-year dietary intervention randomized 220 healthy premenopausal women. The intervention group consumed two daily servings of soy foods containing approximately 50 mg of isoflavones; the control group maintained their regular diet. Five blood samples (obtained in months 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24) were taken 5 days after ovulation as determined by an ovulation kit. The serum samples were analyzed for estrone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin, androstenedione, and progesterone by immunoassay.","At baseline, both groups had similar demographic, anthropometric, and nutritional characteristics. The dropout rates of 15.6% (17 of 109) in the intervention group and 12.6% (14 of 111) in the control group did not differ significantly. According to soy intake logs, 24-hour recalls, and urinary isoflavone excretion, the women closely adhered to the study regimen. Menstrual cycles became slightly shorter in both groups but did not differ by group. Mixed general linear models indicated no significant intervention effect on any of the serum hormones. However, androstenedione and progesterone decreased significantly over time in both groups.",The results of this study suggest that the preventive effects of soy on breast cancer risk in premenopausal women may not be mediated by circulating sex hormone levels.

914,14749092,"This study investigated the relationships between a mindfulness-based stress reduction meditation program for early stage breast and prostate cancer patients and quality of life, mood states, stress symptoms, and levels of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) and melatonin.","Fifty-nine patients with breast cancer and 10 with prostate cancer enrolled in an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program that incorporated relaxation, meditation, gentle yoga, and daily home practice. Demographic and health behavior variables, quality of life, mood, stress, and the hormone measures of salivary cortisol (assessed three times/day), plasma DHEAS, and salivary melatonin were assessed pre- and post-intervention.","Fifty-eight and 42 patients were assessed pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Significant improvements were seen in overall quality of life, symptoms of stress, and sleep quality, but these improvements were not significantly correlated with the degree of program attendance or minutes of home practice. No significant improvements were seen in mood disturbance. Improvements in quality of life were associated with decreases in afternoon cortisol levels, but not with morning or evening levels. Changes in stress symptoms or mood were not related to changes in hormone levels. Approximately 40% of the sample demonstrated abnormal cortisol secretion patterns both pre- and post-intervention, but within that group patterns shifted from &quot;inverted-V-shaped&quot; patterns towards more &quot;V-shaped&quot; patterns of secretion. No overall changes in DHEAS or melatonin were found, but nonsignificant shifts in DHEAS patterns were consistent with healthier profiles for both men and women.","MBSR program enrollment was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms in breast and prostate cancer patients, and resulted in possibly beneficial changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning. These pilot data represent a preliminary investigation of the relationships between MBSR program participation and hormone levels, highlighting the need for better-controlled studies in this area."
915,9181227,"Seromas and impaired shoulder function are well-known complications after modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Early postoperative physiotherapy is a common treatment to avoid shoulder dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the frequency of postoperative seromas could be reduced, without increasing shoulder dysfunction, by delayed postoperative shoulder exercises.",In a prospective study 163 patients with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy were randomized to physiotherapy starting on postoperative day 1 or day 7. Patients were seen by the surgeons and the physiotherapists during hospital stay and in the outpatient department. Seromas and other complications were registered by the surgeons. The physiotherapists instructed the patients pre- and postoperatively and assessed shoulder function.,There was a significantly higher incidence of postoperative seromas in the group of patients that started physiotherapy postoperative day 1 (38%) compared to the group that started physiotherapy postoperative day 7 (22%) (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in the late outcome of shoulder function.,The incidence of seromas after modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer is reduced by delaying shoulder exercises one week postoperatively. Earlier postoperative physiotherapy is not necessary to avoid impaired shoulder function.

In the control group, the intravenous drip of granisetron hydrochloride injection was adopted, 3 mg before and after cisplatin-containing chemotherapy 30 min, continuously for 3 days. 43 to 45\u2103 electrothermal acupuncture at zusanli(ST 36) for 30 min was used on the basis of the treatment as the control group in the trial group,once a day for 3 days. CINV, anti-nausea effects, Karnofsky score, the syndrome score of phlegm-stasis interaction, and relevant indices of safety were observed on the 1st and 7th days of cisplatin-containing chemotherapy separately.","1.Regarding CINV and anti-nausea effect, CINV did not occur before chemotherapy in the patients of the two groups. On the 1st and 7th days of chemotherapy, CINV in the trial group were milder than those in the control group (both &lt;0.05).The anti-nausea effects in the trail group were better than those of the control group.2.Regarding Karnofsky score and the syndrome score of phlegm-stasis interaction, the improvements on the 7th days of chemotherapy in the trial group were better than those in the control group, indicating the significant differences (both &lt;0.05). 3.Regarding the safety indies, there was no adverse reaction during the treatment in the two groups.","The electrothermal acupuncture effectively relieves CINV, and improves self-care dbility and the symptoms of phlegm-stasis interaction."
917,12116072,"Improved cure rates for childhood cancer have produced a growing population of survivors at risk for late toxicities of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Healthy behaviors can modify these risks. We initiated a controlled prospective trial to determine if a multi-component behavioral intervention could induce change in childhood cancer survivors' health knowledge, health perceptions, and practice of health-protective behaviors.",Adolescent cancer survivors attending a long-term follow-up clinic were randomized to receive standard follow-up care or standard care plus the educational intervention. Baseline measures were obtained at randomization (T(0)) and repeated 1 year (T(1)) later during the survivors' annual check-up.,"Of 272 patients enrolled and randomized, 251 are evaluable at both time points. Treatment and control groups were similar in regards to diagnosis, gender, race, and age. The change in outcome measures over the year (T(1)-T(0)) was not significantly different between the two groups as assessed by a two-sample pooled t test. However, additional exploratory analyses indicated a significant gender difference in knowledge with female survivors in the intervention group having higher scores. In addition, patients who choose certain individual health goals, such as breast/testicular self-examination, showed improved practice of the health behavior. In addition, in a very exploratory analysis, a gender difference in response to the intervention was noted, with females exhibiting a greater improvement in knowledge scores than did males.","Although the multi-behavioral educational intervention did not induce change in health knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors of childhood cancer survivors for the treatment group as a whole, gender differences and specific health goal differences were found. These findings suggest that future interventions should be tailored to reflect gender differences and the nature of the health goal under assessment."
918,16826318,Treatment of lymphedema is based on intensive decongestive physiotherapy followed by a long-term maintenance treatment. We analyzed the factors influencing lymphedema volume during maintenance treatment.,"Prospective cohort of 537 patients with secondary arm lymphedema were recruited in a single lymphology unit and followed for 12 months. Lymphedema volume was recorded prior to and at the end of intensive treatment, and at month 6 and month 12 follow-up visits. Multivariate models were fitted to analyze the respective role of the three components of complete decongestive therapy, i.e. manual lymph drainage, low stretch bandage, and elastic sleeve, on lymphedema volume during the 1-year maintenance phase therapy.","Mean volume of lymphedema was 1,054 +/- 633 ml prior and 647 +/- 351 ml after intensive decongestive physiotherapy. During the 1-year maintenance phase therapy, the mean lymphedema volume slightly increased (84 ml-95% confidence interval [CI]: 56-113). Fifty-two percent of patients had their lymphedema volume increased above 10% from their value at the end of the intensive decongestive physiotherapy treatment phase. Non-compliance to low stretch bandage and elastic sleeve were risk factors for an increased lymphedema after 1-year of maintenance treatment (RR: 1.55 [95% CI: 1.3-1.76]; P &lt; 0.0001 and RR: 1.61 (95% CI: 1.25-1.82); P = 0.002, respectively). Non-compliance to MLD was not a risk factor (RR: 0.99 [95% CI: 0.77-1.2]; P = 0.91).","During maintenance phase after intensive decongestive physiotherapy, compliance to the use of elastic sleeve and low stretch bandage should be required to stabilize lymphedema volume."

921,20855414,"Smokers are more prone to develop postoperative complications. Smoking cessation intervention beginning 4-8 weeks prior to surgery improves the postoperative outcome. Cancer patients, however, often undergo surgery less than 4 weeks after diagnosis. The primary objective of this study was therefore to examine if a brief smoking cessation intervention shortly before breast cancer surgery would influence postoperative complications and smoking cessation.",A randomized controlled multicentre trial with blinded outcome assessment conducted at 3 hospitals in Denmark. One hundred and thirty patients were randomly assigned to brief smoking intervention (n = 65) or standard care (n = 65). The intervention followed the principles of motivational interviewing and included personalized nicotine replacement therapy aimed at supporting smoking cessation from 2 days before to 10 days after surgery.,"The overall postoperative complication rate (including seroma requiring aspiration) was 61% in both groups risk ratio (RR) 1.00 (95% CI 0.75-1.33). The wound complication rate was 44% versus 45%. The effect on perioperative smoking cessation was modest, 28% intervention versus 11% control group patients, RR 2.49 (95% CI 1.10-5.60). There was no effect on smoking cessation at 12 months, 13% versus 9%.",Brief smoking intervention administered shortly before breast cancer surgery modestly increased self-reported perioperative smoking cessation without having any clinical impact on postoperative complications. The study adds to the body of evidence indicating that brief intervention has no clinical importance for surgical patients in regard to postoperative morbidity. Future studies should be designed to determine the optimal time of smoking cessation before surgery.

924,20530702,"A clinical trial was designed to test the hypothesis that a psychological intervention could reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Newly diagnosed regional breast cancer patients (n = 227) were randomized to the intervention-with-assessment or the assessment-only arm. The intervention had positive psychological, social, immune, and health benefits, and after a median of 11 years the intervention arm was found to have reduced the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.55; P = 0.034). In follow-up, we hypothesized that the intervention arm might also show longer survival after recurrence. If observed, we then would examine potential biobehavioral mechanisms.","All patients were followed; 62 recurred. Survival analyses included all 62. Upon recurrence diagnosis, those available for further biobehavioral study were accrued (n = 41, 23 intervention and 18 assessment). For those 41, psychological, social, adherence, health, and immune (natural killer cell cytotoxicity, T-cell proliferation) data were collected at recurrence diagnosis and 4, 8, and 12 months later.","Intent-to-treat analysis revealed reduced risk of death following recurrence for the intervention arm (hazard ratio, 0.41; P = 0.014). Mixed-effects follow-up analyses with biobehavioral data showed that all patients responded with significant psychological distress at recurrence diagnosis, but thereafter only the intervention arm improved (P values &lt; 0.023). Immune indices were significantly higher for the intervention arm at 12 months (P values &lt; 0.017).",Hazards analyses augment previous findings in showing improved survival for the intervention arm after recurrence.

926,23803042,"Breast cancer is one of the most frequent diseases in women today. Little information exists on modifiable lifestyle factors including effects of ginger supplements (as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory herbal) and water-based exercise on biomarkers related to oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and adiponectin in obese women with breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the single and concomitant effect of 6-wks water-based exercise and oral ginger supplement on the aforesaid markers in obese women with breast cancer.","Forty women diagnosed with breast cancer (48 \u00b1 5.4 years, 76 \u00b1 9 kg, fat mass 41.8 \u00b1 4%), volunteered to participate in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned into four groups; placebo, water-based exercise, ginger supplement and water-based exercise+ginger supplement groups. Subjects in the ginger supplement group and the water-based exercise+ginger supplement group orally received 4 capsules (each capsule contained 750 mg), 7 days a week for 6 weeks. The water-based exercise program featured progressive increase in intensity and time, ranging from 50% to 75% of heart rate reserve, in a pool with 15 meters width, 4 times a week for 6 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected at pre-test and post-test time points.","The ginger supplementation and or the water-base exercise resulted in an increase of adiponectin, NO and GPx and reduction MDA, as compared to pre-test values. However, the combined intervention (water-base exercise and ginger supplement) group showed significantly a far better effect on the biomarkers related to oxidative stress and adiponectin levels, as compared to the water- base exercise or ginger supplement alone groups and the age-matched placebo group.","Our results revealed that water-base exercise is a non-drug therapeutic strategy to reduce systemic stress in obese women suffering from breast cancer. Further, ginger supplementation alone or in combination with training, also play an important role in the pathogenesis of oxidative stress in obese women diagnosed with breast cancer."
927,25229260,"In head and neck cancer patients undergoing curative radiotherapy, we investigated the benefits and harms of an early exercise regime on trismus.","Patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy were centrally randomised to exercises 5-6 times for 45 minutes during and after radiotherapy supervised by a physiotherapist in addition to usual care versus usual care alone. The primary outcome was change in maximal interincisor distance (MID) measured at 5 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change in cervical ranges of motion, tissue tightness, and health-related quality of life. Mixed model analysis of repeated measures adjusted for tumour size and operation was conducted to assess the effect of early preventive exercises across time periods.","Of the 100 patients included, two patients withdrew and one died before the onset of radiotherapy. The unadjusted mean difference in MID at 12 months after having completed radiotherapy was 0.83 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.64-5.29, p = 0.71) in the exercise intervention group compared with the control group. When adjusted for operation and tumour size, the effect of the exercise intervention on mean MID from baseline to 12-month follow-up was 5.92 mm (95% CI -0.48-12.33, p = 0.07). Of the secondary outcomes, cervical rotation showed a statistically significant deterioration in the exercise group compared with the control group (p = 0.01). No significant effects were observed on the other secondary outcomes.","In patients with cancer in the oral cavity or oropharynx, early supervised exercises combined with self-care treatment focusing on mobility exercises to reduce trismus do not seem to provide additional beneficial effects compared with usual care during curative radiotherapy."
928,19246179,"An observational cohort study in patients undergoing treatment at a single cancer centre to evaluate the usefulness of providing written information on exercise and fatigue to patients at the start of their treatment, to assess whether patients exercised during treatment and their level of fatigue before and after treatment.","Participants were 205 patients of mean age 63.4 years (115 men and 90 women), starting a course of radical radiotherapy, postoperative radiotherapy and palliative radiotherapy or chemotherapy between October 2004 and June 2005 for genitourinary, gynaecological or breast cancer. A patient-held folder was provided, containing written information on cancer or treatment-related fatigue and the use of exercise to manage this, together with flyers for workshops on fatigue management held at local palliative care centres. Study evaluation questionnaires were used for patients to rate the information's usefulness and provide information regarding fatigue. Fatigue level was documented using Brief Fatigue Inventory score sheets. The main research variables were patient rating of the usefulness of the written information provided, whether patients reported being able to exercise during their cancer treatment and self-completed fatigue scores.","The information provided was rated as helpful or very helpful by 70-78% of patients. Overall, 144/163 patients (88.3%) reported exercising during treatment (70.2% of all patients in the fatigue initiative). Patients receiving radical or postoperative radiotherapy as compared with chemotherapy, and those using the information supplied were more likely to exercise during treatment. There was a significant overall increase in mean fatigue from the start to the end of cancer treatment (P&lt;0.001). Patients who did not exercise, younger patients, those with breast cancer and those receiving chemotherapy (compared with radical or postoperative radiotherapy) all had higher fatigue scores.",Provision of written information on exercise to manage fatigue was rated as helpful by most patients receiving cancer therapies; patients who were able to exercise during treatment had lower fatigue levels.

The control group received standard information. The intervention group received this information plus a written self-help coping leaflet. The primary outcome measure was the intrusion subscale of the Impact of Event Scale.","The intervention significantly reduced intrusive thoughts during the waiting period in those reporting moderate baseline levels of intrusion (p\u2009=\u20090.03). Following risk provision, those in the intervention group reporting low and moderate intrusive worries at baseline reported less intrusive thoughts than those in the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.04 and p\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively). The intervention had no adverse impact in the sample as a whole. Participants in the intervention group with high baseline avoidance and negative affect scores were significantly more likely to remain in the study than those in the control group (p\u2009=\u20090.05 and p\u2009=\u20090.004).","Findings that the intervention both reduced distress in those with moderate levels of distress and had no adverse effects following notification of cancer genetic risk suggest that this simple intervention can be implemented across a range of oncology settings involving periods of waiting and uncertainty. The intervention may also reduce the number of individuals dropping out of cancer genetic risk assessment or screening. However, those with clinically high levels of psychological distress are likely to require a more intensive psychological intervention."

Significant weight loss did not occur in either group. A significant difference in the change in bioavailable estradiol concentration from baseline to 1 year in the intervention (-13 pmol/L) versus the comparison (+3 pmol/L) group was observed (P &lt;.05). Change in fiber (but not fat) intake was significantly and independently related to change in serum bioavailable estradiol (P &lt;.01) and total estradiol (P &lt;.05) concentrations.","Results from this study indicate that a high-fiber, low-fat diet intervention is associated with reduced serum bioavailable estradiol concentration in women diagnosed with breast cancer, the majority of whom did not exhibit weight loss. Increased fiber intake was independently related to the reduction in serum estradiol concentration."

We investigated whether rikkunshito could improve chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and anorexia in patients treated with cisplatin.","Patients with uterine cervical or corpus cancer who were to receive cisplatin (50 mg/m\u00b2 day 1) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m\u00b2 day 0) as first-line chemotherapy were randomly assigned to the rikkunshito group receiving oral administration on days 0-13 with standard antiemetics, or the control group receiving antiemetics only. The primary endpoint was the rate of complete control (CC: no emesis, no rescue medication, and no significant nausea) in the overall phase (0-120 hours). Two-tailed p&lt;0.20 was considered significant in the planned analysis.","The CC rate in the overall phase was significantly higher in the rikkunshito group than in the control group (57.9% vs. 35.3%, p=0.175), as were the secondary endpoints: the CC rate in the delayed phase (24-120 hours), and the complete response (CR) rates (no emesis and no rescue medication) in the overall and delayed phases (63.2% vs. 35.3%, p=0.095; 84.2% vs. 52.9%, p=0.042; 84.2% vs. 52.9%, p=0.042, respectively), and time to treatment failure (p=0.059). Appetite assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) appeared to be superior in the rikkunshito group from day 2 through day 6.",Rikkunshito provided additive effect for the prevention of CINV and anorexia.
935,17487874,"In this prospective controlled randomized trial we assessed the effects of early, intensive, prolonged pelvic floor exercises (PFE) on urinary incontinence following bladder neck (BN) sparing RRP.","A sample of 152 patients with localized prostate cancer underwent RRP with BN preservation. Out of this group we randomized 107 incontinent patients into 2 groups. We considered incontinent patients with 24 hr Pad test &gt;2 g. The T group received instructions regarding an intensive program of PFE, from 7 days after catheter removal for as long as any degree of incontinence persisted, within a period of 1 year. The control (C) group did not receive instructions. The outcome was assessed using the 24 hr Pad test, a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a single question of QoL. Results at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were available for 54 and 40 patients, respectively.","The overall spontaneous continence rate after catheter removal was 23.6%. The proportion of men still incontinent was significantly higher in the C group than treatment (T) group at 1 (97.5% vs. 83.3%; P = 0.04), 3 (77.5% vs. 53.7%; P = 0.03), 6 (60% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.01), and 12 months (52.5% vs. 16.6%; P &lt; 0.01). Similarly, the VAS and the response to the QoL question at 12 months significantly differed between the two groups (P = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively).",Our study suggests that early intensive prolonged PFE can further increase the number of continent patients and this improvement persists in the first 12 months. The second 6 months following surgery are still useful to recovery.
936,28830541,"Anthracyclines, alone or in combination with other drugs, are among the most effective chemotherapeutic agents to treat breast cancer both in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. Unfortunately, anthracycline-associated dose-dependent cardiotoxicity is a limiting factor in clinical use. Extensive efforts have been devoted to identifying strategies to prevent anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. However, most cardioprotective agents have shown little effect in clinical trials. Herbal medicines are pure, natural substances that have been used for centuries in many countries, including China. This trial aims to evaluate the cardioprotective effects and safety of Platycodon grandiflorum granules compared to placebo granules in patients with early breast cancer receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","This study is a single-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. A total of 120 patients will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either P. grandiflorum granules or placebo granules twice daily for 12\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome is heart failure (either clinical or subclinical). The secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, cardiac death, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, left ventricular diastolic function, longitudinal systolic strain and velocities measured by tissue Doppler imaging, cardiac biomarkers, such as troponin I (TnI), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB). Assessments will be performed at baseline (before randomization) and 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20\u00a0weeks after randomization.",This will be the first clinical trial to evaluate the cardioprotective effects and safety of P. grandiflorum in patients with early breast cancer receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

937,18538965,"The conditions of use and access to medical records have become an important source of interest in the last decade. In this context, our main objective was to assess the impact of a paper patient-held records, shared with healthcare professionals.","In the particular case of breast cancer management, we identified the expectations of practitioners and patients. Secondly and according to a Delphi method, we defined the content and size of a medical record, which could be held by the patient. Following these preliminary studies, we conducted a randomized controlled trial, comparing patients with usual follow-up to others holding the new record containing essential information for coordination of care.","The patient-held record favoured membership and satisfaction of both patients and health professionals. It was used as a communication tool between physicians and patients, but could also cause anxiety to some patients. Patient quality of life, data confidentiality and costs of care remained identical in the two arms. With its benefits for both patients and healthcare professionals, a new concept of medical records was revealed by this study.",New models for healthcare organization deeply modify the roles and relationships of all the actors in the healthcare system. Further research on patient-held records is needed to evaluate the full range of its benefits and limits.
938,23045575,"The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), physical exercise (PE), and of these two interventions combined (CBT/PE) on menopausal symptoms (primary outcome), body image, sexual functioning, psychological well-being, and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) in patients with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause.","Patients with breast cancer reporting treatment-induced menopausal symptoms (N=422) were randomly assigned to CBT (n=109), PE (n=104), CBT/PE (n=106), or to a waiting list control group (n=103). Self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Multilevel procedures were used to compare the intervention groups with the control group over time.","Compared with the control group, the intervention groups had a significant decrease in levels of endocrine symptoms (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms; P&lt;.001; effect size, 0.31-0.52) and urinary symptoms (Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire; P=.002; effect size, 0.29-0.33), and they showed an improvement in physical functioning (36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning subscale; P=.002; effect size, 0.37-0.46). The groups that included CBT also showed a significant decrease in the perceived burden of hot flashes and night sweats (problem rating scale of the Hot Flush Rating Scale; P&lt;.001; effect size, 0.39-0.56) and an increase in sexual activity (Sexual Activity Questionnaire habit subscale; P=.027; effect size, 0.65). Most of these effects were observed at both the 12-week and 6-month follow-ups.","CBT and PE can have salutary effects on endocrine symptoms and, to a lesser degree, on sexuality and physical functioning of patients with breast cancer experiencing treatment-induced menopause. Future work is needed to improve the design and the planning of these interventions to improve program adherence."
939,12721240,"A phase III, randomized, double-blind study was conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group to determine the efficacy and toxicity of oral glutamine for the prevention of acute diarrhea in patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy (RT).","All 129 patients enrolled from 14 institutions between February 1998 and October 1999 were eligible. Patients received 4 g of glutamine or placebo orally, twice a day, beginning with the first or second day of RT and continuing for 2 weeks after RT. During treatment, patients were assessed weekly for toxicity, and a bowel function questionnaire was administered. The primary measures of treatment efficacy were diarrhea levels measured by maximum grade of diarrhea, incidence of diarrhea, and average diarrhea score. After completion of RT, the bowel function questionnaire was administered weekly for 4 weeks and at 12 and 24 months. Toxicity was measured by National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria.","The median age of patients was 69 years (range, 34 to 86 years). The two treatment arms were balanced with respect to all baseline factors. There were no significant differences in toxicity by treatment. Quality-of-life scores and the mean number of problems reported on the bowel function questionnaire were virtually identical for both treatment groups. The incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea was 20% for the glutamine arm and 19% for the placebo arm (P =.99). The maximum number of stools per day was 5.1 for the glutamine arm and 5.2 for the placebo arm (P =.99).",There is no evidence of a beneficial effect of glutamine during pelvic RT.
940,15941955,"This report examines the outcome data for Project PREVENT, a two-site randomized control trial designed to reduce behavioral risk factors for colorectal cancer among individuals who have been diagnosed with adenomatous colon polyps.","The study sample included 1,247 patients with recent diagnosis of adenomatous colorectal polyps. Within 4 weeks following the polypectomy, participants completed a baseline survey by telephone, and were randomized to either Usual Care (UC) or the PREVENT intervention, which was designed to target multiple risk factors. The intervention consisted of a telephone-delivered intervention plus tailored materials, and focused on the six primary behavioral risk factors for colorectal cancer, including red meat consumption, fruit and vegetable intake, multivitamin intake, alcohol, smoking, and physical inactivity.","Participation in the PREVENT intervention was associated with a significantly greater reduction in prevalence of multiple risk factors for colorectal cancer compared with UC. Only about one third of UC participants dropped any risk factors during the study period, compared with almost half of the PREVENT participants. PREVENT participants were also significantly more likely to change more than one behavior than UC participants.","The PREVENT intervention was effective in helping patients change multiple risk factors. These results provide further support that more comprehensive interventions that move beyond emphasis on a single risk factor are acceptable to patient populations, can result in improvements, and are cost effective."
941,10814693,"To evaluate the relationship between pain sensitivity and children's distress during lumbar punctures (LPs), and whether pain sensitivity functions as a moderator of children's responses to a psychological intervention aimed at reducing LP distress.","Fifty-five children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ages 3 to 18) and their parents completed a questionnaire measure of pain sensitivity. Self-report, physiological, and observed measures of distress were collected during the study baseline LP. Children were then randomized into a psychological intervention or an attention control group. Postintervention and follow-up LPs were observed.","Higher levels of pain sensitivity were associated with greater anxiety and pain, both prior to and during the LP. Preliminary analyses indicated that pain sensitivity moderated the effects of intervention on distress. Children who were more pain-sensitive and who received no intervention showed greater increases in LP distress over time. In contrast, children who were more pain-sensitive and who received intervention showed greater decreases in LP distress over time.",A measurement of pain sensitivity may be useful in pediatric oncology settings for effectively targeting pain-vulnerable children for psychological intervention. Preliminary analyses indicate that an empirically-supported intervention for procedural distress is efficacious for those children who are most pain-sensitive.
942,18835434,"A diagnosis of breast cancer and treatment are psychologically stressful events, particularly over the first year after diagnosis. Women undergo many demanding and anxiety-arousing treatments such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Psychosocial interventions that promote psychosocial adaptation to these challenges may modulate physiological processes (neuroendocrine and immune) that are relevant for health outcomes in breast cancer patients.",Women with Stages 1-3 breast cancer recruited 4-8 weeks after surgery were randomized to either a 10-week group-based cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention or a 1-day psychoeducational control group and completed questionnaires and late afternoon blood samples at study entry and 6 and 12 months after assignment to experimental condition.,"Of 128 women initially providing psychosocial questionnaire and blood samples at study entry, 97 provided complete data for anxiety measures and cortisol analysis at all time points, and immune assays were run on a subset of 85 of these women. Those assigned to a 10-week group-based CBSM intervention evidenced better psychosocial adaptation (lower reported cancer-specific anxiety and interviewer-rated general anxiety symptoms) and physiological adaptation (lower cortisol, greater Th1 cytokine [interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma] production and IL-2:IL-4 ratio) after their adjuvant treatment compared to those in the control group. Effects on psychosocial adaptation indicators and cortisol appeared to hold across the entire 12-month observation period. Th1 cytokine regulation changes held only over the initial 6-month period.",This intervention may have facilitated a &quot;recovery or maintenance&quot; of Th1 cytokine regulation during or after the adjuvant therapy period. Behavioral interventions that address dysregulated neuroendocrine function could play a clinically significant role in optimizing host immunologic resistance during a vulnerable period.
943,29520533,"Approximately 20% of breast cancer survivors develop breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), and current therapies are limited. We compared acupuncture (AC) to usual care wait-list control (WL) for treatment of persistent BCRL.",Women with moderate BCRL lasting greater than six months were randomized to AC or WL. AC included twice weekly manual acupuncture over six weeks. We evaluated the difference in circumference and bioimpedance between affected and unaffected arms. Responders were defined as having a decrease in arm circumference difference greater than 30% from baseline. We used analysis of covariance for circumference and bioimpedance measurements and Fisher's exact to determine the proportion of responders.,"Among 82 patients, 73 (89%) were evaluable for the primary endpoint (36 in AC, 37 in WL). 79 (96%) patients received lymphedema treatment before enrolling in our study; 67 (82%) underwent ongoing treatment during the trial. We found no significant difference between groups for arm circumference difference (0.38\u00a0cm greater reduction in AC vs. WL, 95% CI -\u00a00.12 to 0.89, p\u2009=\u20090.14) or bioimpedance difference (1.06 greater reduction in AC vs. WL, 95% CI -\u00a05.72 to 7.85, p\u2009=\u20090.8). There was also no difference in the proportion of responders: 17% AC versus 11% WL (6% difference, 95% CI -\u00a010 to 22%, p\u2009=\u20090.5). No severe adverse events were reported.","Our acupuncture protocol appeared to be safe and well tolerated. However, it did not significantly reduce BCRL in pretreated patients receiving concurrent lymphedema treatment. This regimen does not improve upon conventional lymphedema treatment for breast cancer survivors with persistent BCRL."
944,23364035,The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an individualized nutritional education programs on nutrient intake and nutritional status of patients with colorectal cancer who are undergoing palliative chemotherapy.,"Forty patients with colorectal cancer (19 experimental and 21 control patients) were recruited from a chemotherapy ward at S University Hospital in Seoul, Korea. The experimental group received two individualized nutritional counseling sessions and two telephone counseling sessions over 6 weeks. The control group received nutritional counseling after completion of data collection. Nutritional education included general guidelines for food intake while receiving chemotherapy, dietary guidelines for patients with colorectal cancer, daily meal schedules to overcome cancer, and dietary guideline for each chemotherapy side effect. Data were analyzed using \u03c7\u00b2-test and t-test with the SPSS program 17.0.","Two group comparison revealed that the experimental group had significantly improved calorie (p=.038) and total protein intake (p=.001), and serum albumin percentage change (p=.040). Body weight did not increase but remained the same as the baseline in both groups.",Study results indicate that this individualized nutritional education programs are effective in enhancing nutrient intake and nutritional status of patients with colorectal cancer who are undergoing palliative chemotherapy.
945,18779540,"Anemia in patients with solid tumors is a common problem that is associated with impaired exercise capacity, increased fatigue, and lower quality of life (QoL). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been shown to improve these outcomes; however, it is unknown if additional benefits can be achieved with aerobic exercise training.","We conducted a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial in 55 mild-to-moderately anemic patients with solid tumors. Patients were randomized to either darbepoetin alfa alone (DAL, n = 29) or darbepoetin alfa plus aerobic exercise training (DEX; n = 26). The DEX group performed aerobic exercise training three times per week at 60%-100% of baseline exercise capacity for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was QoL assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia scale. Secondary endpoints were fatigue, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2peak)), hemoglobin (Hb) response, and darbepoetin alfa dosing.","Intention-to-treat analyses indicated significant improvements in QoL and fatigue in both groups over time but there were no between-group differences. The DEX group had a significantly greater VO(2peak) than the DAL group (mean group difference, +3.0 ml/kg per minute; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.7; p = .001) and there were borderline significant differences in favor of the DEX group for Hb response and darbepoetin alfa dosing.",Aerobic exercise training did not improve QoL or fatigue beyond the established benefits of DAL but it did result in favorable improvements in exercise capacity and a more rapid Hb response with lower dosing requirements. Our results may be useful to clinicians despite the more recent restrictions on the indications for ESAs.
946,17023828,This nonrandomized controlled trial was designed to investigate the effects of acute exercise on neutrophil count and function in children and adolescents receiving maintenance treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to matched controls.,"Participants (n = 10; 4 ALL patients and 6 healthy matched controls) were males between the ages of 7 to 18 years. On visit 1, participants completed an incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a treadmill to determine peak aerobic fitness (VO(2peak)). On visit 2, participants completed a 30-minute exercise session consisting of an intermittent run-walk on a treadmill at 70% to 85% of VO(2) peak with blood sampling completed at 5 time points: fasting, preexercise, postexercise, 1-hour postexercise, and 2-hour postexercise.","A significant increase in absolute neutrophil count from preexercise to postexercise was observed in both groups (P = 0.011). Neutrophil oxidative capacity was significantly depressed in the ALL group at the basal level (P = 0.029), however, it increased in both groups after exercise and stimulation.",This preliminary study suggests that 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise in ALL patients receiving maintenance therapy provides a similar neutrophil response to that of healthy age and sex-matched controls.
947,17932364,We examined the feasibility of using gene expression changes in human prostate epithelium as a measure of response to a dietary intervention.,"Eight men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were randomized to a low-fat/low-glycemic load intervention arm (&lt;20% energy from fat and total daily glycemic load &lt;100) or a &quot;standard American&quot; control arm (approximately 35% energy from fat and total daily glycemic load &gt;200). Prostate tissue was collected before randomization and approximately 6 weeks later, at the time of radical prostatectomy. Epithelium was acquired by laser capture microdissection, and transcript abundance levels were measured by cDNA microarray hybridization and confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.","Men in the intervention arm consumed 39% less total energy (P = 0.004) and the difference in weight change between intervention and control arms was -6.1 kg (P = 0.02). In the intervention arm, 23 (0.46%) of 5,711 cDNAs with measurable expression were significantly altered (P &lt; 0.05; false discovery rate, &lt;or=10%). In the control arm, there were no significant changes in transcript expression, even when using a false discovery rate as high as 50%.","A 6-week, low-fat/low-glycemic load diet was associated with significant gene expression changes in human prostate epithelium. These results show the feasibility of using prostate tissues collected at diagnosis and at surgery to study the effects of dietary manipulation on prostate tissue, which may give insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the associations of diet and obesity with the development or progression of prostate cancer."
948,17719361,The present study sought to assess the ability of dispositional optimism to predict the psychological responses of women with a family history of breast cancer who had been referred to counseling for familial breast cancer.,"Women completed questionnaires prior to (n=735), immediately after (n=655), and 9 months after (n=545) attending counseling. Breast cancer risk status was assessed and communicated to the women in the clinics.","Dispositional optimism was found to predict lower levels of anxiety and breast cancer worries immediately following counseling as well as lower levels of anxiety and perceived risk at 9-month follow-up, controlling for corresponding baseline scores. In addition, risk status moderated the optimism-perceived risk relationship, such that optimism was only predictive of lower risk perceptions among women at high risk.",Low levels of dispositional optimism may be considered to be a risk factor for adverse reactions to high breast cancer risk information. The implications of the findings for the clinical management of such reactions are discussed.
949,9060535,"Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia are significant estrogen-depletion symptoms that affect many breast cancer survivors. The present trial was developed to evaluate the nonhormonal vaginal lubricating preparation, Replens, for alleviating these symptoms.","A double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial was developed. Patients received 4 weeks of Replens (Columbia Research Laboratories, Rockville Centre, NY) followed by a 1-week washout period followed by 4 weeks of a placebo lubricating product, or vice versa. Weekly patient-completed diaries were used for measuring efficacies and toxicities of therapy.","The 45 assessable patients provided well-balanced treatment groups. During the first 4 weeks, average vaginal dryness decreased by 62% and 64% in the placebo and Replens groups, respectively (P = .3). Average dyspareunia scores also improved by 41% and 60%, respectively (P = .05). Crossover analysis indicated that the bulk of the beneficial effects appeared within the first 2 weeks of the first treatment and remained constant thereafter. Both treatments were relatively well tolerated.",Both Replens and the placebo appear to substantially ameliorate vaginal dryness and dyspareunia in breast cancer survivors.
950,15991068,The aim of this study was to investigate whether brief psychologic interventions to reduce perioperative stress may improve the postoperative course of patients undergoing abdominal surgery.,"We used a randomized, controlled, partially blinded trial to evaluate the differential effectiveness of two brief psychologic interventions (guided imagery and progressive muscle relaxation) on analgesic requirement, pain perception, pulmonary function, duration of postoperative ileus, and fatigue after conventional resection of colorectal carcinoma in elderly cancer patients.","Sixty patients (20 guided imagery, 22 relaxation, 18 control) were evaluated. Acceptance of the brief psychologic interventions was high and 90 percent of the patients indicated that they would recommend it to other patients. Analgesic consumption (P = 0.6) and subjective pain intensity at rest (P = 0.3) and while coughing (P = 0.3) were not different between groups. Recovery of pulmonary function, duration of postoperative ileus, and subjective postoperative fatigue were also not influenced. When the data from intervention groups were pooled, again no benefits were detected compared with the control group.",Brief psychologic interventions such as guided imagery and relaxation yielded a very positive patient response but did not show a clinically relevant influence on the postoperative physiologic course of elderly patients undergoing conventional resections of colorectal cancer.
951,15735130,Colorectal cancer screening is the most underused cancer screening tool in the United States. The purpose of this study was to test whether a health care provider-directed intervention increased colorectal cancer screening rates.,"The study was a randomized controlled trial conducted at two clinic firms at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The records of 5,711 patients were reviewed; 1,978 patients were eligible. Eligible patients were men aged 50 years and older who had no personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, had not received colorectal cancer screening, and had at least one visit to the clinic during the study period. Health care providers in the intervention firm attended a workshop on colorectal cancer screening. Every 4 to 6 months, they attended quality improvement workshops where they received group screening rates, individualized confidential feedback, and training on improving communication with patients with limited literacy skills. Medical records were reviewed for colorectal cancer screening recommendations and completion. Literacy level was assessed in a subset of patients.","Colorectal cancer screening was recommended for 76.0% of patients in the intervention firm and for 69.4% of controls (P = .02). Screening tests were completed by 41.3% of patients in the intervention group versus 32.4% of controls (P = .003). Among patients with health literacy skills less than ninth grade, screening was completed by 55.7% of patients in the intervention group versus 30% of controls (P &lt; .01).",A provider-directed intervention with feedback on individual and firm-specific screening rates significantly increased both recommendations and colorectal cancer screening completion rates among veterans.
952,7597016,"Electronic media have demonstrated efficacy in increasing knowledge and promoting health-protective behavior among individuals at high risk for chronic disease. In &quot;Stimulating Cancer Screening among Women of Color through Video&quot; (A. K. Yancey and L.

These videos could not be independently evaluated within the cancer control program for which they were developed.","A quasi-experimental study design tested the hypothesis that exposure to these videos increases cervical cancer screening behavior among samples of women from two clinic populations of predominantly low-income African-Americans and Latinos in New York City and Los Angeles. A 1-week-on-1-week-off design was utilized, in which the videos were continuously displayed in designated waiting rooms during on (intervention) weeks, with each facility serving as its own control during off weeks.",The proportion of women seen as patients during the intervention weeks who subsequently obtained Pap smears was significantly higher than that of those seen during the control weeks at each site (P &lt; 0.05).,Culturally sensitive videos displayed in waiting rooms may be useful in health promotion efforts in communities of color. The similarity of results in both clinic sites suggests that Spanish-language tapes may be constructed to appeal to Latinos of different nationalities.
953,18386567,To observe the effects of rhubarb and enteral nutrition on C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in peripheral blood of patients with gastric cancer during perioperative period.,"Fifty-six patients with gastric cancer were randomly assigned to three groups. The 20 patients in Group A were given conventional fluid supplement and parenteral nutrition; the 21 patients in Group B were given conventional fluid supplement and enteral nutrition via nasal feeding starting from the 42nd hour to the 8th day after operation; and the 15 patients in Group C were treated, besides the same fluid supplement and enteral nutrition as that for Group B, with additional three times of 10% rhubarb liquid medication, given at the day before operation (100 mL), and the 18th and 42th hour post-operation (50 mL in each time). Serum levels of CRP and IL-6 of all patients were measured at different time points, i. e. the day before operation (T0), the 1st (T1), 3rd (T2) and 7th day (T3) after operation.","Acute inflammatory reaction happened in all the patients. However, the plasma level of CRP and IL-6 in Group C at T3 (12.67 +/- 4.28 mg/L and 18.17 +/- 11.10 mg/L) was significantly lower than those in Group A (19.72 +/- 9.73 mg/L and 20.44 +/- 6.32 mg/L) and Group B (21.27 +/- 10.46 mg/L and 20.29 +/- 7.79 mg/L), respectively (P &lt; 0.05). And the recovery time of borborgmus in Group C were the shortest among the three groups.","Applying rhubarb on gastric cancer patients during perioperative period can effectively decrease the levels of CRP and IL-6 in peripheral blood, alleviate acute inflammatory reaction caused by operative trauma, promote the recovery of postoperative gastrointestinal motility and be beneficial for the supplement of enteral nutrition."
954,12689805,Current cancer prevention recommendations include reducing consumption of fat and increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables.,"Healthy women health maintenance organization members (n = 616) ages 40-70 were randomly assigned to either a nutrition intervention or a control intervention unrelated to diet. Intervention included two 45-min counseling sessions plus two brief follow-up telephone contacts. Counseling sessions included a 20-min, interactive, computer-based intervention using a touch-screen format. Intervention goals were reducing dietary fat and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption. Outcome measures included a food frequency questionnaire and the Fat and Fiber Behavior Questionnaire (FFBQ). Total serum cholesterol was also measured at baseline and 12 months.","Twelve-month follow-up data showed improvements on all dietary outcome variables. Compared to the control, intervention participants reported significantly less fat consumption (3.75 points less for percentage of energy from fat), significantly greater consumption of fruit and vegetables combined (0.93 more servings per day), and a significant reduction in a behavioral measure of fat consumption (0.20 point change in the FFBQ). Group differences in total serum cholesterol, while in the desired direction, were not significant.","In appropriate circumstances, moderate-intensity dietary interventions can show significant effects for periods of at least 1 year."
955,15289492,"To evaluate the herbal combination, PC-SPES, and diethylstilbestrol (DES) in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer (AIPC).","A randomized phase II study was conducted with cross-over design. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either three PC-SPES capsules orally three times a day or DES 3 mg orally once a day. Prophylactic warfarin was administered. At clinical or prostate-specific antigen progression, patients received the other therapy. The study closed prematurely after PC-SPES was withdrawn from the market. Chemical analyses were performed on multiple lots of PC-SPES.","Ninety patients were enrolled, of whom 85 were assessable for response. Prostate-specific antigen declines &gt; or = 50% were noted in 40% (95% CI, 25% to 56%) with PC-SPES, and 24% (95% CI, 12% to 39%) with DES. Median response duration was not reached with PC-SPES, and was 3.8 months with DES. Median time to progression for randomly assigned patients was 5.5 months for PC-SPES and 2.9 months for DES. Common toxicities included mild fatigue, gynecomastia, and mastodynia. Five thromboembolic events occurred (one PC-SPES, four DES). Responses in the cross-over phase were inconclusive. Four lots of PC-SPES had measurable quantities of DES, ranging from 0.01% to 3.1% of the dose used in the DES arm. Ethinyl estradiol was also detected in PC-SPES lots.","PC-SPES and DES demonstrate activity in AIPC and are well tolerated. However, the synthetic estrogens, DES and ethinyl estradiol, were detected in various lots of PC-SPES, including those used in this trial. Clinical trials that utilize herbal therapies must account for issues of purity and consistency."
956,12050495,"The indication for topic chemotherapy or immunotherapy for well differentiated, noninvasive superficial bladder cancer remains controversial. Side effects of these treatments promoted use of unconventional therapies with cytokines, immunomodulators and mistletoe extracts. However, there are no controlled clinical data available on the efficacy of these extracts for bladder cancer. We evaluate the influence of subcutaneously applicated mistletoe lectin on bladder tumor recurrence after transurethral resection.","The study consists of 45 patients with pTa G1-2 bladder cancer treated with transurethral resection during a 3-year period. Median patient age was 65 years and 33 patients were male. The study cohort was randomly divided into a treatment group receiving adjuvant therapy with mistletoe lectin and a control group receiving no additional treatment. Patients in the treatment group received mistletoe lectin according to schedule 2 weeks after transurethral resection. Clinical followup was assessed 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after the initial resection, and included uretherocystoscopy.","Both study arms comprised similar patients with regard to total number of previous tumors (mean 2.6 versus 2.9), number of primary lesions (14 versus 12) and number of recurrent tumors (8 versus 11). After followup of 18 months the recurrence-free interval in both study arms was similar (p = 0.76) and the total number of recurrences comparable (p = 0.48).","Subcutaneous use of mistletoe lectin as adjuvant treatment after transurethral resection does not seem to affect the time to first recurrence, total number of recurrences or recurrence-free outcome."
957,28940301,The current randomized trial examined the effects of a Tibetan yoga program (TYP) versus a stretching program (STP) and usual care (UC) on sleep and fatigue in women with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy.,"Women with stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM) I to III breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy were randomized to TYP (74 women), STP (68 women), or UC (85 women). Participants in the TYP and STP groups participated in 4 sessions during chemotherapy, followed by 3 booster sessions over the subsequent 6 months, and were encouraged to practice at home. Self-report measures of sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory), and actigraphy were collected at baseline; 1 week after treatment; and at 3, 6, and 12 months.","There were no group differences noted in total sleep disturbances or fatigue levels over time. However, patients in the TYP group reported fewer daily disturbances 1 week after treatment compared with those in the STP (difference, -0.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.82 to -0.04 [P\u2009=\u2009.03]) and UC (difference, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.05 [P\u2009=\u2009.02]) groups. Group differences at the other time points were maintained for TYP versus STP. Actigraphy data revealed greater minutes awake after sleep onset for patients in the STP group 1 week after treatment versus those in the TYP (difference, 15.36; 95% CI, 7.25-23.48 [P\u2009=\u2009.0003]) and UC (difference, 14.48; 95% CI, 7.09-21.87 [P\u2009=\u2009.0002]) groups. Patients in the TYP group who practiced at least 2 times a week during follow-up reported better Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy outcomes at 3 months and 6 months after treatment compared with those who did not and better outcomes compared with those in the UC group.","Participating in TYP during chemotherapy resulted in modest short-term benefits in sleep quality, with long-term benefits emerging over time for those who practiced TYP at least 2 times a week.

958,16594275,The multidimensional aspect of pain suggests the use of multimodal interventions. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center has recently utilized the art therapy modality to help patients communicate the painful side of their illness in such a way that they can feel understood and respected. In this paper we describe a simple innovative art therapy intervention that we have developed within the Art Therapy Service in the Psychiatric Department of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.,"The patients work with a Body Outline as a starting template, together with the art therapist, in sessions lasting approximately 45 minutes. They are encouraged to fill the space inside and outside the Body Outline. They can use colored pastels, markers, or watercolor or cut out images for a collage.","Seventy hospitalized adult cancer patients, 60 women and 10 men, used this intervention between January 1999 and May 2000. We have analyzed the variety of responses from the 70 patients, and three main groups have emerged, which have focused on the following issues: (1) visualization of physical pain, (2) communication of emotions, and (3) search for meaning/spirituality.","The results suggest that because of its abstract symbolic feature, the Body Outline is a very flexible therapeutic intervention. It must be offered within the relationship with the art therapist, and it may fulfill quite a variety of expressive needs, from the description of physical pain to the elaboration of spiritual longings."
959,22410606,The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of a home based exercise program for patients with stomach cancer who were undergoing oral chemotherapy.,"The home-based exercise program was developed from the study findings of Winningham (1990) and data from the Korea Athletic Promotion Association (2007). The home-based exercise program consisted of 8 weeks of individual exercise education and exercise adherence strategy. Participants were 24 patients with stomach cancer who were undergoing oral chemotherapy following surgery in 2007 or 2008 at a university hospital in Seoul. Patients were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (11) or control group (13). The effects of the home-based exercise program were measured by level of cancer related fatigue, NK cell ratio, anxiety, and quality of life. Data were analyzed using SPSS/WIN 13.0 version.",The degree of cancer related fatigue and anxiety in the experimental group decreased compared to the control group. The NK cell ratio and the degree of quality of life of experimental group increased while that of the control group decreased.,This study result indicate the importance of exercise and provide empirical evidence for continuation of safe exercise for patients with cancer during their chemotherapy.
960,10845343,This study examined the effects of a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) group intervention on serum cortisol levels in women being treated for stage I or II breast cancer.,Participants were randomly assigned to undergo a 10-week intervention (N = 24) within 8 weeks after surgery or were placed on a waiting list (N = 10). Cortisol was assessed by means of a radioimmunoassay of blood samples collected at the same time of day just before the start of the intervention and immediately after its completion. The women also reported the degree to which breast cancer had made positive contributions to their lives.,"Intervention participants showed increased benefit finding and reduced serum cortisol levels, whereas control subjects experienced neither change. Path analysis suggested that the effect of CBSM on cortisol was mediated by increases in benefit finding.",These findings suggest that positive growth enhanced during a time-limited intervention can influence physiological parameters such as cortisol among women with early stage breast cancer.
961,10322831,To find a more effective treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma by using combined therapy of Chinese herbal medicine with radiotherapy.,Prospective study was conducted with double-blind method on prognosis of patients treated with combined therapy of Xuefu Zhuyu decoction and move stripe field radiation on entire liver. A control group was established and treated with placebo and radiotherapy.,"The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of the test group were higher than those of the control group by 20.0%, 23.4% and 16.6% respectively. The remote metastatic rate of the two groups were not different significantly.","Xuefu Zhuyu decoction showed coordinative effect with radiotherapy on antitumor, it could enhance the radiosensitivity of liver cancer cells, increase the radiation tolerance of normal hepatocytes and reduce the side effect of radiotherapy."
962,18761755,"Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce psychological morbidity in people with cancer, but no randomized controlled trial (RCT) exists in palliative care. We aimed to determine whether home care nurses could be taught to deliver basic cognitive behavioural techniques and so reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) at St Christopher's Hospice were randomly allocated to receive training in CBT or continue their usual practice. At the end of the trial, nurses were rated on the Cognitive Therapy First Aid Rating Scale (CTFARS) for CBT competence. Home care patients who scored as possible cases on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) entered the trial. Participants received home care nursing visits. Assessments were carried out at baseline, 6, 10 and 16 weeks.","Eight nurses received CBT training and seven continued practice as usual. The mean CTFARS scores were 35.9 for the CBT nurses and 19.0 for the controls (p=0.02). A total of 328 patients (54%) were possible cases and 80 entered the trial; most of those excluded were too ill to participate. There was an interaction between group and time: individuals receiving CBT had lower anxiety scores over time [coefficient -0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.35 to -0.05, p=0.01]. No effect of the training was found for depression.",It is possible to conduct a randomized trial of psychological interventions in palliative care but there is considerable attrition from physical morbidity and mortality. Nurses can learn to integrate basic CBT methods into their clinical practice. This training may be associated with better outcomes for symptoms of anxiety.
963,1614990,"The Women's Health Trial (WHT) was a feasibility study for a randomized controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that a reduction in dietary fat reduces breast cancer incidence among women age 45 to 69. Between 1984 and 1988, 2,064 women participated in its two phases.","A follow-up study of 525 women who were randomized to receive the WHT dietary intervention program was conducted to assess maintenance of the diet 1 year on average after the trial ended. Among 448 participants, the mean percentage of energy from fat as measured by a food frequency questionnaire was 40.0% at baseline, 26.3% at the end of the trial, and 27.7% at follow-up. Based on 408 women with complete data, a recursive model was estimated, describing the influence of baseline characteristics of the women on attendance at intervention program sessions, adherence to the diet during the trial, and long-term maintenance of the diet after the trial ended. The effects of women's experiences during the trial on adherence and long-term maintenance were investigated as well.","Attendance at the educational sessions was strongly related to adherence to the diet during the trial (P less than 0.001), and adherence was the most important predictor of long-term maintenance (P less than 0.001). The percentage of energy from dietary fat at baseline was an important correlate of both adherence (P less than 0.001) and long-term maintenance (P less than 0.001). College-educated women were more likely to adhere to the diet during the trial (P less than 0.001). Feelings of deprivation adversely affected long-term maintenance (P less than 0.01), primarily through their effect on adherence during the trial (P = 0.01). Costliness of the diet in time and money negatively influenced long-term maintenance (P less than 0.05). Development of a distaste for fat encouraged adherence (P = 0.06).","The low-fat dietary pattern established during the WHT was maintained for as long as 20 months after the trial ended. A recursive model was useful in analyzing the process and correlates of long-term maintenance of dietary behavior change. Both predisposing variables and women's experiences while on a low-fat diet were associated with long-term maintenance. The results suggest that feelings of deprivation should be avoided, perhaps by use of low-fat substitutes, by those attempting to lower their dietary fat and that more research is needed on the development of a distaste for fat among individuals who adopt low-fat diets."
964,10649262,"Oral cancer satisfies the criteria for a suitable disease for screening, and oral visual inspection is a suitable test for oral cancer screening. The efficacy of screening in reducing mortality from oral cancer has not yet been evaluated. The authors describe a cluster-randomized, controlled oral cancer screening trial in southern India and its early results.","Apparently healthy subjects age 35 years or older in 13 clusters called panchayaths were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 7) or a control group (n = 6). Subjects in the intervention group will receive 3 rounds of screening consisting of oral visual inspection by trained health workers at 3-year intervals. The first round of screening was carried out between October 1995 and May 1998. Participants were visited in their homes and interviewed for sociodemographic details, tobacco-smoking and alcohol-drinking habits, and personal medical history. Those with tobacco or alcohol habits were advised to stop those habits. Subjects in the intervention group were offered screening, and those with lesions suggestive of oral leukoplakia, submucous fibrosis, or oral cancer were referred for examination by physicians. Confirmed leukoplakias were excised whenever possible, others were kept on follow-up, and those with confirmed oral cancers were referred for treatment. Data on oral cancer incidence, stage distribution, survival, and mortality in the study groups are obtained by record linkage with the Trivandrum population-based cancer registry and municipal death registration systems.","There were 59,894 eligible subjects in the intervention group and 54,707 in the control group; 31.4% of the former group reported no tobacco or alcohol habits, compared with 44.1% of the latter. The distribution of age, education, occupation, income, and socioeconomic status were similar in the two groups. Of 3585 subjects in the intervention group referred, 52.4% were examined by physicians; 36 subjects with oral cancers and 1310 with oral precancers were diagnosed. Of the 63 oral cancers recorded in the cancer registry, 47 were in the intervention group and 16 were in the control group, yielding incidence rates of 56.1 and 20.3 per 100,000 person-years in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The program sensitivity for detection of oral cancer was 76.6% and the specificity 76.2%; the positive predictive value was 1.0% for oral cancer. In the intervention group, 72.3% of the cases were in Stages I-II, as opposed to 12.5% in the control group. The 3-year case fatality rates were 14.9% (7 of 47 patients) in the intervention group and 56.3% (9 of 16 patients) in the control group.","Though compliance with referral for confirmatory examination in the first round was lower than the 70% anticipated, intermediate end points, such as stage at diagnosis and case fatality, indicate that the trial is making fairly satisfactory progress."
965,28658162,"Nutritional interventions for malnutrition in cancer patients can be helpful. However, concise intervention recommendations remain controversial. Thus, the aim of this study was to report on a nutrition intervention conducted by a multidisciplinary team of specialist nurses and to explore the effect of nutritional intervention on cancer patients.","This prospective clinical trial study enrolled 110 colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The patients were evaluated upon admission using the 2002 Nutritional Risk Screening system (NRS-2002). The patients were randomly divided into intervention and control groups including 55 patients each. Patients in the control group were administered a normal diet, while those in the intervention group received individual recipes developed by a team of professional nurses, clinical doctors, dietitian, family caregivers, and the patients themselves. Patient weight and serum albumin and prealbumin levels were compared between the 2 groups at different time points.","There was a significant difference in patient weight and serum albumin and prealbumin levels before and after nutrition intervention in the intervention group (P\u200a&lt;\u200a.05). In the control group, weight did not change during ordinary diet guidance. Serum albumin level was slightly improved after 12 cycles of chemotherapy, similar to the prealbumin results. There were statistically significant differences in serum albumin and prealbumin levels between the intervention and control groups after nutrition intervention (P\u200a&lt;\u200a.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference in weight between the groups after nutrition intervention (P\u200a&gt;\u200a.05).","A multidisciplinary team approach for nutrition intervention conducted by specialist nurses improved prealbumin levels in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with no weight change."

Microwave therapy was applied to both groups by double leads, 60 W, 800 sec once a week for two weeks. To the treated group, SQM was given additionally through oral intake of 20 ml, three times a day for 1 month. The changes in tumor size, main symptoms, serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), immune function and adverse reaction were observed after treatment and the immune parameters of the patients were compared with 30 healthy persons in the normal control group.","(1) In the SQM treated group, after treatment 3 patients got completely remitted (CR), 24 partial remitted (PR), 4 unchanged (NC) and 5 progressively deteriorated (PD), the effective rate being 75.00%; while in the control group, 1 got CR, 19 PR, 9 NC and 7 PD, the effective rate being 55.56%. Comparison of the effective rate between the two groups showed significant difference (P &lt; 0.05). (2) AFP level decreased after treatment in both groups, but the decrement in the treated group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.01). (3) After treatment, in the treated group, CD3(+), CD4(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+) and NK activity were improved, Karnofsky scores increased and liver function bettered, with these improvements significantly superior to those in the control group (P &lt; 0.01).

It is one of the effective therapies for patients with middle-advanced hepatocarcinoma, who have lost the chance of surgical operation. It could improve clinical symptoms, elevate the quality of life, prolong the survival period of patients, but shows no evident adverse reaction."
967,17333332,To measure the effectiveness of a tailored decision aid (DA) designed to help women make informed decisions about genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk.,"A total of 145 women were randomized to receive the DA or a control pamphlet at the end of their first genetic counseling consultation. Of these, 120 (82.8%) completed two questionnaires, 1 week and 6 months post-consultation.","While the DA had no effect on informed choice, post-decisional regret or actual genetic testing decision, the trial showed that women who received the DA had higher knowledge levels and felt more informed about genetic testing than women who received the control pamphlet (chi(2)(2) = 6.82; P = 0.033; chi(2)(1) = 4.86; P = 0.028 respectively). The DA also helped women who did not have blood drawn at their first consultation to clarify their values with regards to genetic testing (chi(2)(1) = 5.27; P = 0.022).

Multimodal rehabilitation involving exercise and diet prescription may attenuate some of the negative consequences and optimise survivorship, and this was assessed in this feasibility study in OC patients at least 1\u00a0year post-oesophagectomy.","The 12-week programme included supervised and home-based exercise, dietetic counselling to ensure energy balance and multidisciplinary education. Baseline and post-intervention assessments examined aerobic fitness, physical activity and body composition. Serum interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 were measured via multiplex arrays. Lactate secretion, lipid peroxidation (4-HNE) and oxidative stress (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).","Twelve patients (mean (SD) age 64(1.29) years) participated. IL-8 reduced significantly from pre- to post-intervention (percentage change -11.25\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI -20.98 to -1.51\u00a0%), p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and there was a non-significant trend towards lower expression patterns of other inflammatory mediators. At baseline, inflammatory status correlated inversely with sedentary behaviour (IL-6 rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.74, IL-8 rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.59, TNF-\u03b1 rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.69; p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). While energy metabolism did not change, post-intervention lactate concentration correlated strongly and inversely with aerobic fitness (rho\u00a0=\u00a0-0.68, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Body composition was maintained throughout the intervention.",Results suggest that multimodal rehabilitation following OC treatment reduced inflammatory status without compromising body composition. Findings will be further examined in a larger randomised controlled trial.
977,30477836,Children with cancer undergoing chemotherapy experience many adverse effects. The effectiveness of painting- and handcrafting-based art therapy on the various dimensions of health-related quality of life in paediatric outpatients previously diagnosed with heterogeneity of malignancy was evaluated in the present study.,"In an experimental randomized controlled trial, a total of 60 children aged 7-13 years previously diagnosed with malignancy together with their parents were assigned randomly either to an experimental (30 patients) or a control group (30 patients) in 2017 in Iraq. The patients in the experimental group participated in painting and handcrafting group art therapy (creative art therapy) conducted by a professional fine artist for a one-month period. The dimensions of health-related quality of life in both study groups were measured through the KIDSCREEN-10 Index after project completion.","The patients in the experimental group were significantly more physically active and energetic (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), were less depressed and emotional, and had fewer stressful feelings (P\u2009=\u20090.004). Moreover, they enjoyed their social and leisure time more and participated more in social activities (P\u2009=\u20090.003) in addition to an improvement in their relationships with other children (P\u2009=\u20090.043) and had better overall health status (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). However, the children's overall interaction with other children, parents, and healthcare providers (P\u2009=\u20090.074) and their perception of cognitive capacity for school performance (P\u2009=\u20090.257) were not significantly different between the two groups.",The findings of the study suggest that exposure to painting- and handcrafting-based art therapy improves the overall health-related quality of life in children with cancer.
978,20669035,The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a self-help workbook for improving adjustment for breast cancer survivors.,"An RCT compared the workbook (n = 20) with no-workbook controls (n = 20). Coping, traumatic stress and quality of life were measured at baseline, then 3 and 6 months later.","No interactions were found. A significant group main effect was found for venting coping; controls used less venting coping than workbook participants (p = 0.034). A significant time main effect was obtained for cognitive functioning (p = 0.003). Reliable change indices showed a trend towards a protective effect across all coping measures for workbook participants compared to controls. Qualitative feedback suggested that participants felt well supported by the intervention, but would have preferred receiving it during treatment.","While trends showed some promise for improving coping, endorsement for the workbook was not obtained. The difficulties encountered in recruiting survivors and the resulting implications regarding the feasibility of offering self-help resources to this population are discussed."
979,20819671,"There is increasing interest in the role of dietary factors in both the development and behaviour of prostate cancer. This study was carried out to evaluate the impact of the dietary factor lycopene on DNA synthesis, activity and expression of the androgen receptor gene element in prostate LnCaP cells and to report our pilot phase II study investigating its effect on prostate-specific antigen velocity over one year.","LnCaP cells were grown with or without different concentrations of lycopene or tetrahydrofuran (THF solvent) added to the culture medium for 48 hours. DNA synthesis was measured by the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) into DNA during a 4-hour pulse, followed by immunostaining and visualization of stained cells using fluorescence microscopy. A transient transfection of a plasmid DNA recombinant containing an androgen receptor element-luciferase (ARE-Luc) report gene into LnCaP cells was developed and the impact of different concentrations of lycopene on the androgen receptor element was reflected by quantitative analysis of the luciferase enzyme function. Expression of the androgen gene was also studied by Western blotting. The phase II pilot study patients (n=41) previously diagnosed with prostate cancer were enrolled and given lycopene supplement, 10 mg per day, and response was measured by observing changes in the plasma prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.","The addition of 0.5 micromol/L, 5 micromol/L, 10 micromol/L and 15 micromol/L of lycopene was shown to inhibit cell growth by 2.66%, 4.29%, 3.73% and 13.66%, respectively, compared with the THF solvent control samples (P=0.015). As compared with the RPMI1640 medium group, cell proliferation in the presence of 5 micromol/L, 10 micromol/L, and 15 micromol/L lycopene was inhibited by 8.12%, 6.33% and 12.00%, respectively (P=0.024). We showed for the first time that lycopene inhibited the activity of the androgen receptor gene element in a dose-related manner. Inhibition was seen in the transcription of the luciferase construct and confirmed by androgen receptor element expression assayed by Western blotting. Regression slopes of (log) PSA vs. time decreased in 26/37 (70%, 95%CI 53%-84%) of the patients after supplementation and in eight cases (21%) the post-treatment slope was negative. For these eight patients, the average fall in PSA was equivalent to 2% over 28 days (i.e. an average slope/d of -0.000713). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed an overall statistically significant decrease in slope (P=0.0007). Analysis of the PSA doubling time (pretreatment vs. posttreatment) showed a median increase after supplementation for 174 days; however, this was not statistically significant (P=0.18).",Lycopene as an antioxidant dietary factor could significantly inhibit DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent pattern; the result revealed lycopene might inhibit androgen receptor gene element activity and expression. Dietary lycopene may play an important role in prostate cancer cell proliferation and further supports a large randomized study into the role of lycopene supplementation in malignant prostate disease.
980,26430826,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition defined by exceeding triglycerides accumulation in the liver. The condition can develop into fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Considering the ever-increasing prevalence of NAFLD, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of probiotic supplementation on glycemic and inflammatory indices in patients with NAFLD.","This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 42 patients with NAFLD who had been referred to a gastroenterology clinic. Subjects in the intervention and control groups consumed 2 capsules/day probiotic or placebo, respectively, for 8 weeks. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, insulin resistance, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured at baseline and at the end of the study.","Means of FBS, insulin, insulin resistance, and IL-6 were significantly different between groups after intervention (p &lt; 0.05), whereas TNF-\u03b1 was not significantly modified (p &gt; 0.05). In the probiotic group, insulin, insulin resistance, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 decreased significantly at the end of the study compared to the beginning of study.","Considering the effects of probiotic supplementation on the reduction of glycemic and inflammatory indices in patients with NAFLD, consumption of probiotics is recommended as a complementary therapy in these patients."
981,27530996,"A stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a brief psychosocial intervention for depressed cancer patients, delivered by trained front-line health professionals in routine clinical care.","Nine hundred two patients were assessed across four treatment centres which were allocated in random order from control epoch to intervention epoch. Eligible patients had Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores of 8 or greater. Of eligible patients, 222 were recruited in control epoch and 247 in intervention epoch. Twenty-seven health professionals (HPs) were trained to deliver the psychosocial intervention consisting of up to four sessions, tailored to patient symptoms and distress. HPs participated in group supervision with a psychiatrist. The primary outcome, analysed by intention to treat, was depression measured with the HADS at 10\u00a0weeks after receiving the intervention.","At 10-week follow-up, there were no significant differences in HADS score for the 181 patients in control epoch and 177 in intervention epoch (adjusted difference -1.23, 95\u00a0% CI -3.81--1.35, p\u00a0=\u00a00.35). Patients with disease progression who received the intervention experienced significant benefits in unmet practical support needs including care and support, information, and physical and daily living.",A brief psychosocial intervention delivered by front-line oncology health professionals is feasible to deliver but is insufficient as a stand-alone treatment for depression in cancer patients. Psychosocial interventions should be targeted to populations most likely to experience benefit.
982,18263997,To assess the effectiveness of breast health promoting messages administered by salon stylists to clients in the salon setting.,"Forty salons in an urban, minority area were randomly assigned to provide messages to clients or to serve as controls. Pre-intervention surveys were completed by 1,185 salon clients. Following program initiation, assessments of 1,210 clients were conducted.","Among women completing surveys at control salons, 10% reported exposure to breast health messages, as opposed to 37% at experimental salons (OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.7-7.9). Self-reported exposure to stylist-delivered messages was associated with improved breast self-examination rates (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1) and with greater intentions to have a clinical breast examination (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3).",Hair salons are a potentially important venue for promotion of health behaviors related to breast cancer detection.
983,26248651,"This study evaluated the efficacy of a self-guided Web-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention compared to an attention control in improving cancer-related distress, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and maladaptive coping, among people recently diagnosed with cancer.","Sixty individuals with cancer diagnosed in the previous 6 months and receiving treatment with curative intent were randomised to receive either the 6-week intervention Cancer Coping Online (CCO: n = 30) or the 6-week Web-based attention control (n = 30). Outcome measures, including cancer distress (the Posttraumatic Stress Scale - Self-Report), general distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), and coping (mini-MAC), were administered at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 months post-intervention.","Significant main effects for time were found for cancer distress, global QOL, physical function, role function, social function, and anxious preoccupation. Post hoc between-group comparisons showed CCO participants had statistically significantly higher physical functioning compared to controls at 3 months of follow-up (d = -0.52, p = 0.02). Furthermore, compared to controls, post hoc comparisons found moderate between-group effect sizes favouring CCO post-intervention for cancer distress (d = 0.43) and anxious preoccupation (d = 0.38), and at 6 months of follow-up for global QOL (d = -0.43).","These results provide preliminary support for the potential efficacy of a self-guided Web-based CBT programme in improving aspects of HRQOL, cancer-related distress, and anxious preoccupation after cancer diagnosis. This paper provides justification for, and will help inform the development of, subsequent larger multi-site studies."
984,8625175,"Most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) arise in patients with cirrhosis, in whom its incidence is high. The prevention of HCC in patients with cirrhosis is important.","A prospective, randomized, nonblind controlled study was performed to evaluate the preventive effect of Sho-saiko-to (TJ-9) on HCC development. TJ-9 is a Chinese herbal medicine that contains crude extracts of seven herbs; it has antitumor effects in experimental animals. Two hundred sixty patients with cirrhosis were randomly assigned to two groups, matched for age, sex, presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, and the severity of liver damage. The patients in the trial group were given TJ-9 at a daily oral dose of 7.5 g in addition to the conventional drugs given to the control patients. The patients were prospectively monitored for 60 months and the cumulative incidence of HCC and the survival rate in the two groups were calculated.","The cumulative incidence curve for 5 years of the trial group was lower than that of the control group (P = 0.071). For the patients without HBs antigen, the difference was significant (P = 0.024). The survival curve for 5 years of the trial group was higher than that of the control group (P = 0.053).

The $2 and $5 incentives increased overall response in controls from 61.9% to 72.8% and 77.2%, respectively, i.e., by 10.9% (95% CI = 6.1-15.6) and 15.1% (95% CI = 10.4-19.7), after adjustment. This effect was largely confined to urban areas (for $2 and $5, respectively: 5.5% and 14.2% in Toronto, 15.3% and 20.4% in other urban areas vs. 2.7% and 1.0% in rural areas; p = 0.02). Response time showed little or no improvement when the brochure was included, but was markedly reduced for both the $2 and $5 incentives.","Cash incentives can improve subject response in epidemiologic studies, whereas information brochures do not appear to have an effect."
986,17891547,"Patients receiving intensive chemotherapy can experience increased distressed related to both the cancer diagnosis and treatment isolation. If not addressed, distress can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and possible benefits of a music imagery intervention for patients hospitalized in a protective environment for the treatment of acute leukemia or high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.",Adults receiving intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy in a protective environment were randomized to standard care or standard care plus music imagery. The music imagery sessions occurred twice weekly for up to eight sessions. Patients were encouraged to use the music imagery daily.,"The principal criteria of feasibility were rate of consent, rate of completion of scheduled sessions, and rate of questionnaire completion. Forty-nine out of 78 patients consented, a 63% consent rate. Seventy-two percent of all scheduled music imagery sessions were completed. The rate of questionnaire completion was 60% with missing data because of illness severity and early discharge. The principal outcomes of benefit (e.g., efficacy) were positive and negative affects, fatigue, and anxiety. Both groups improved over time on all outcomes (all p &lt; 0.001). However, a subgroup of individuals with low baseline negative affect who received the intervention reported significantly less anxiety at discharge than individuals with low baseline negative affect who did not receive the intervention.",Music imagery is feasible for adults with acute leukemia in protected environments. Patients with lower initial distress may benefit from a music imagery program in terms of reduced anxiety at discharge.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a web-delivered physical activity intervention among adolescent survivors to increase moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and improve fitness and neurocognitive and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) over 24 weeks.","This randomized controlled trial was conducted among survivors (aged \u226511 to &lt;15 years) treated at a single institution. Participants were randomized to either a physical activity intervention delivered over the internet or a control group. The intervention group received educational materials, an activity monitor, and access to an interactive website designed to motivate increased physical activity via rewards; the control group received an activity monitor and educational materials. Physical activity, fitness, and neurocognitive and HRQoL outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 24 weeks. Mean changes were compared between groups using paired t-tests.","Of the 97 survivors enrolled, 78 completed the study; the mean age was 12.7 (standard deviation 1.1), 80% were White, and 55.1% were female.

989,17925539,"The Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification (DM) Randomized Controlled Trial evaluated the effects of a low-fat dietary pattern on chronic disease incidence, with breast cancer and colorectal cancer as primary outcomes. The trial protocol also listed ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer as outcomes that may be favorably affected by the intervention.","A total of 48,835 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned during 1993-1998 to a DM intervention (n = 19,541) or comparison (usual diet; n = 29,294) group and followed up for an average of 8.1 years. The intervention goal was to reduce total fat intake to 20% of energy and to increase consumption of vegetables, fruits, and grains. Cancer outcomes were verified by pathology report review. We used weighted log-rank tests to compare incidence of invasive cancers of the ovary and endometrium, total invasive cancer, and invasive cancers at other sites between the groups. All statistical tests were two-sided.","Ovarian cancer risk was lower in the intervention than in the comparison group (P = .03). Although the overall ovarian cancer hazard ratio (HR) was not statistically significantly less than 1.0, the hazard ratio decreased with increasing intervention duration (P(trend) = .01). For the first 4 years, the risk for ovarian cancer was similar in the intervention and control groups (0.52 cases per 1000 person-years in the intervention group versus 0.45 per 1000 person-years in the comparison group; HR = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73 to 1.84); over the next 4.1 years, the risk was lower in the intervention group (0.38 cases per 1000 person-years in the intervention group versus 0.64 per 1000 person-years in the comparison group; HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.96).

990,20087643,"Many cancer patients continue to smoke post diagnosis, yet there have been few smoking cessation trials for this population. Depression, which is prevalent among cancer patients, may be a barrier to cessation.","This double-blind placebo-controlled trial randomized 246 cancer patients to 9 weeks of placebo or bupropion, stratifying by pre-treatment depression symptoms. In addition, all patients received transdermal nicotine and behavioral counseling. Primary outcomes were 7-day point-prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed, at the end of treatment (Week 12), and at 6 months post quit day (Week 27). Additional outcomes included: withdrawal, affect, quality of life, compliance, and side effects.","There was no main effect of bupropion vs. placebo on abstinence (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.38-4.81, p = .64). Patients with depression symptoms reported significantly lower abstinence rates vs. patients without depression symptoms (OR = .14, 95% CI: 0.02-0.80, p = .03). Bupropion increased abstinence rates, vs. placebo, more for participants with depression vs. those without depression symptoms. For patients with depression symptoms, bupropion reduced withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life vs. placebo.","For patients with depression symptoms, bupropion increases abstinence rates, lowers withdrawal, and increases quality of life. However, abstinence rates among patients with depression symptoms were low vs. patients without depression symptoms, who exhibited similar abstinence rates when treated with bupropion or transdermal nicotine and counseling alone. These results can guide future smoking cessation intervention studies with cancer patients."
991,12065562,Professionally administered psychosocial interventions have been shown to improve the quality of life of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The present study sought to improve access to psychosocial interventions during chemotherapy treatment by evaluating the efficacy and costs of a patient self-administered form of stress management training that requires limited professional time or experience to deliver.,"Four hundred eleven patients about to start chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive usual psychosocial care only, a professionally administered form of stress management training, or a patient self-administered form of stress management training. Quality-of-life assessments were conducted before randomization and before the second, third, and fourth treatment cycles. Intervention costs were estimated from both payer and societal perspectives.","Compared with patients who received usual care only, patients receiving the self-administered intervention reported significantly (P &lt; or = .05) better physical functioning, greater vitality, fewer role limitations because of emotional problems, and better mental health. In contrast, patients who received the professionally administered intervention fared no better in terms of quality of life than patients receiving usual care only. Costs of the self-administered intervention were estimated to be 66% (from a payer perspective) to 68% (from a societal perspective) less than the average costs of professionally administered psychosocial interventions for patients starting chemotherapy.",Evidence regarding the efficacy and favorable costs of self-administered stress management training suggests that this intervention has the potential to greatly improve patient access to psychosocial intervention during chemotherapy treatment.

The size of the effect of active dietary counselling was 37% at 3 months (95%CI: 21-54%) and 35% at 24 months (95%CI: 17-53%). Mean fat intake was halved at 3 months and 24 months in Group 1 only.,Demonstrating such feasibility is a key step towards defining diet's role in the secondary prevention of breast cancer.
994,23314556,Disturbed DNA methylation is causally related to chronic diseases like cancer and atherosclerosis. B vitamins are cofactors required for methyl group synthesis and may therefore affect DNA methylation. Vitamin D has epigenetic effects. We tested if B and D vitamin supplementation has an effect on genomic long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation and the metabolites S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).,"Fifty subjects (median age 68.0 years) were supplemented with a daily oral dose of B vitamins (500 \u00b5g folic acid, 500 \u00b5g vitamin B12 and 50 mg vitamin B6), 1200 IU vitamin D and 456 mg calcium. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after 1 year of supplementation. LINE-1 methylation was determined in genomic DNA from blood cells as a surrogate for whole genome methylation. In addition, SAM, SAH and total homocysteine (tHcy) were measured in plasma samples.","Plasma homocysteine decreased significantly after supplementation (12.8 vs. 9.1 \u00b5mol/L; p&lt;0.05), whereas SAM, SAH, the SAM/SAH ratio and LINE-1 methylation did not change significantly. LINE-1 methylation was not significantly correlated with SAH, homocysteine or B vitamins.","Long-term vitamin B supplementation had no effect on LINE-1 methylation in blood cells nor on plasma levels of SAM and SAH. Vitamin B and D supplementation seems to have no effect on DNA methylation, especially in cases where no severe deficiency exists."

The effects of a combination of 30 mg of beta carotene per day and 25,000 IU of retinol (vitamin A) in the form of retinyl palmitate per day on the primary end point, the incidence of lung cancer, were compared with those of placebo.","A total of 388 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed during the 73,135 person-years of follow-up (mean length of follow-up, 4.0 years). The active-treatment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.57; P=0.02), as compared with the placebo group. There were no statistically significant differences in the risks of other types of cancer. In the active-treatment group, the relative risk of death from any cause was 1.17 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.33); of death from lung cancer, 1.46 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.07 to 2.00); and of death from cardiovascular disease, 1.26 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.61). On the basis of these findings, the randomized trial was stopped 21 months earlier than planned; follow-up will continue for another 5 years.","After an average of four years of supplementation, the combination of beta carotene and vitamin A had no benefit and may have had an adverse effect on the incidence of lung cancer and on the risk of death from lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and any cause in smokers and workers exposed to asbestos."
996,17969893,To observe the efficacy of Zhiling Capsule (ZLC) in improving symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in patients with various types of cancer in mid-advanced stage.,"A multi-centre randomized and controlled trial was conducted. Four hundred patients with mid-advanced cancer were assigned to two groups: the treatment group (300 cases) treated with ZLC and the control group (100 cases) with Pingxiao Capsule (PXC), both were given orally for two weeks. Clinical symptoms, QOL, weight and adverse reactions were observed before and after treatment.","Improving rate of symptom, increasing rates of QOL and weight in the treatment group were all higher than those in the control group (P&lt;0.05); and no obvious adverse reaction was observed in the two groups.",ZLC could alleviate the qi-yin deficiency syndrome and pain syndrome and improve QOL in patients with various types of cancer in mid-advanced stage.
997,11199239,This study examined the nurse outcomes of a cancer pain education program for nurses of patients from 11 different ethnic groups.,"Four hundred ninety six home, hospital, and hospice nurses participated in a one-day workshop or two half-day workshops on cancer pain assessment and management. Of these, 116 were randomized to participate in a bedside-precepted visit with an oncology nurse specialist with pain specialization and a focus group to discuss attitudinal issues. Eighty-six nurses served as controls. Pre-, post- and one-year follow-up tests were administered.","Attitudes, knowledge, and application skills significantly improved for workshop-only and enriched-model nurses relative to controls.","For postgraduate nurses, daylong cancer pain education workshops were, in the group studied, as effective as hands-on experience in improving cancer pain knowledge and changing attitudes. Both the workshop-only and the enriched-model nurses relative to controls had significantly improved knowledge and changed attitudes towards optimal pain management."

Furthermore, in the treated group after treatment, the blood hypercoagulation state ameliorated, cellular immunity elevated, the toxic and side- effects of chemical medicine relieved, and the quality of life improved.","GY II is effective in enhancing clinical effects and relieving toxic and side-effects of chemotherapy, and so, better efficacy could be obtained by therapy of GY II and arterial perfusion with chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of APC."
999,30365254,To explore the effect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) combined with transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection (LCCR).,"A total of 101 patients undergoing LCCR were randomly divided into three groups: control (\uff1d34), TAP (\uff1d35) and TEAS\uff0bTAP (\uff1d32). Conventional perioperative anesthesia management of the 3 groups was performed according to the ERAS guidelines. All the patients experienced patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), and those of the TAP and TEAS\uff0bTAP groups received TAP block by injection of 0.3% Roperca hydrochloride (15 mL) into the space between the internal oblique and the transverse abdominis after induction of anesthesia. For patients of the TEAS\uff0bTAP group, TEAS (2 Hz/10 Hz, an endurable stimulation strength) was applied to bilateral Zusanli (ST 36) from 30 min before anesthesia to the end of the surgery. The blood glucose value and dosage of Remifentanil used were recorded. The pain severity was assessed at 4, 12, 24 and 48 h after surgery by using visual analogue scale (VAS). Moreover, postoperative anal exhaust time, postoperative oral feeding time, postoperative first ambulation time and postoperative hospital stay length were recorded.","The total dosages of Remifentanil used during surgery, and the blood glucose levels were significantly lower in the TAP and TEAS\uff0bTAP groups than in the control group (&lt;0.05), but had no significant differences between the TAP and TEAS\uff0bTAP groups (&gt;0.05). The VAS scores of the TAP and TEAS\uff0bTAP groups were considerably lower than those of the control group at 4, 12, 24 and 48 h after surgery (&lt;0.05, except 48 h of TAP group). Of the 34, 35 and 32 cases in the control, TAP and TEAS\uff0bTAP groups, 5(14.7%), 3(8.6%) and 1(3.1%) on the 1 day post-surgery, and 2(5.9%), 0(0) and 0(0) on the 2 day after surgery experienced nausea and vomiting. The postoperative anal exhaust time and postoperative oral feeding time were significantly earlier in both TAP and TEAS\uff0bTAP groups than in the control group (&lt;0.05), and the exhaust time of the TEAS\uff0bTAP group was even earlier than that of the TAP group (&lt;0.05). No significant differences were found among the 3 groups in the postoperative ambulation time and postoperative hospitalization time (&gt;0.05).","TEAS combined with TAP block analgesia is superior to simple TAP block analgesia in relieving postoperative pain, shortening the recovery time of gastrointestinal function and promoting postoperative rehabilitation in patients undergoing LCCR."
1000,19242918,To determine the effect of exercise on quality of life in (a) a randomized controlled trial of exercise among recently diagnosed breast cancer survivors undergoing adjuvant therapy and (b) a similar trial among post-treatment survivors.,"Fifty newly diagnosed breast cancer survivors were recruited through a hospital-based tumor registry and randomized to a 6-month, home-based exercise program (n=25) or a usual care group (n=25). In a separate trial, 75 post-treatment survivors were randomized to a 6-month, supervised exercise intervention (n=37) or to usual care (n=38). Participants in both studies completed measures of happiness, depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, and quality of life at baseline and 6 months.",Forty-five participants completed the trial for newly diagnosed survivors and 67 completed the trial for post-treatment survivors. Good adherence was observed in both studies. Baseline quality of life was similar for both studies on most measures. Exercise was not associated with quality of life benefits in the full sample of either study; however exercise was associated with improved social functioning among post-treatment survivors who reported low social functioning at baseline (p&lt;0.05).,Exercise did not affect quality of life in either recently diagnosed or post-treatment breast cancer survivors; however this may be due in part to relatively high baseline functioning among participants in both studies. Strategies for future research include limiting enrollment to survivors who report reduced quality of life on screening questionnaires and targeting survivor subgroups known to be at particular risk for quality of life impairment.
1001,29282534,"Prostate cancer patients who have undergone androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may experience cognitive impairment, yet there is an unmet need for nonpharmacological interventions to address cognitive impairment in this population. This study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a home-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) program to treat cancer-related cognitive impairment.",Sixty men who had received \u2265\u20093\u00a0months of ADT were screened for at least mild cognitive or neurobehavioral impairment and randomized to 8\u00a0weeks of CCT or usual care. Follow-up assessments occurred immediately post-intervention or equivalent (T2) and 8\u00a0weeks later (T3). The acceptability of CCT was also assessed.,"Feasibility:A priori feasibility thresholds were partially met (i.e., randomization rate &gt;\u200950%, retention rate &gt;\u200970% excluding CCT drop-outs, but &lt;\u200970% for intent-to-treat). Acceptability: Participants were mostly satisfied with CCT and found it somewhat enjoyable, though barriers to uptake existed. Preliminary efficacy: Linear mixed models indicated significant time by group effects favorable to CCT in reaction time (p\u2009=\u2009.01), but unfavorable to CCT in verbal and visual memory (ps\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.05). Memory was temporarily suppressed in the CCT group at T2, but normalized by T3. There was no effect of CCT on self-reported cognitive functioning, neurobehavioral functioning, nor quality of life.","This study provides tentative support for the feasibility and acceptability of CCT to treat mild cognitive impairment in ADT patients. CCT had a beneficial effect on reaction time, but temporarily suppressed memory. CCT's benefits may be limited to a narrow area of functioning. Larger-scale studies are needed."
1002,17119044,"Until there is a definitive demonstration that early diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer reduces disease-related mortality, it is imperative to promote informed screening decisions by providing balanced information about the potential benefits and risks of prostate cancer screening. Within a community/academic collaboration, we conducted a randomized trial of a printed booklet and a videotape that were designed for African American (AA) men. The purpose of the trial was to determine the effect of the interventions on knowledge, decisional conflict, satisfaction with the screening decision, and self-reported screening.","Participants were 238 AA men, ages 40 to 70 years, who were members of the Prince Hall Masons in Washington, DC. Men were randomly assigned to the (a) video-based information study arm, (b) print-based information study arm, or (c) wait list control study arm. Intervention materials were mailed to men at home. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 1 month, and 12 months postintervention. Multivariate analyses, including ANCOVA and logistic regression, were used to analyze group differences.","The booklet and video resulted in a significant improvement in knowledge and a reduction in decisional conflict about prostate cancer screening, relative to the wait list control. Satisfaction with the screening decision was not affected by the interventions. Self-reported screening rates increased between the baseline and the 1-year assessment, although screening was not differentially associated with either of the interventions. In exploratory analyses, prostate-specific antigen testing at 1 year was more likely among previously screened men and was associated with having low baseline decisional conflict.","This study represents one of the first randomized intervention trials specifically designed to address AA men's informed decision making about prostate cancer screening. We have developed and evaluated culturally sensitive, balanced, and disseminable materials that improved knowledge and reduced decisional conflict about prostate cancer screening among AA men. Due to the high incidence and mortality rates among AA men, there is a need for targeted educational materials, particularly materials that are balanced in terms of the benefits and risks of screening."
1003,24212124,This study aimed to examine mediators of fatigue response to an exercise intervention for breast cancer survivors in a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"Postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (n = 46; \u2264stage 2), off primary treatment, and reporting fatigue and/or sleep dysfunction were randomized to a 3-month exercise intervention (160 min\u00b7wk of moderate-intensity aerobic walking, twice weekly resistance training with resistance bands) or control group. Six discussion group sessions provided behavioral support to improve adherence. Fatigue, serum cytokines, accelerometer physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, sleep dysfunction, and psychosocial factors were assessed at baseline and 3 months.","The exercise intervention effect sizes for fatigue were as follows: fatigue intensity d = 0.30 (P = 0.34), interference d = -0.38 (P = 0.22), and general fatigue d = -0.49 (P = 0.13). Using the Freedman-Schatzkin difference-in-coefficients tests, increase in fatigue intensity was significantly mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6) (82%), IL-10 (94%), IL-6/IL-10 (49%), and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1):IL-10 (78%) with reduced sleep dysfunction increasing the relationship between intervention and fatigue intensity rather than mediating intervention effects (-88%). Decrease in fatigue interference was mediated by sleep dysfunction (35%), whereas IL-10 and pro-anti-inflammatory cytokine ratios increased the relationship between intervention and interference (-25% to -40%). The reduction in general fatigue was significantly mediated by minutes of physical activity (76%), sleep dysfunction (45%), and physical activity enjoyment (40%), with IL-10 (-40%) and IL-6/IL-10 (-11%) increasing the intervention-fatigue relationship. In the intervention group, higher baseline fatigue, anxiety, depression, and perceived exercise barrier interference predicted a greater decline in fatigue interference and/or general fatigue during the intervention.","Biobehavioral factors mediated and enhanced intervention effects on fatigue, whereas psychosocial factors predicted fatigue response. Further study is warranted to confirm our results and to improve understanding of relationships that mediate and strengthen the intervention-fatigue association."
1004,29363465,"Behavioral activation (BA) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are considered particularly useful treatments when dealing with emotional problems of cancer survivors. The efficacy of these two treatments, applied on a group basis, were evaluated and compared.","An analysis was carried out of pre-post treatment changes in the emotional state and patterns of activation/avoidance of 52 cancer patients, with anxiety and/or depression, randomly assigned to three groups (BA/ACT/waiting list control).",Both therapies were superior to no treatment in all the variables evaluated. Significant differences were found between the two treatments in favor of ACT in social impairment and avoidance/rumination.,"BA and ACT, applied on a group basis, are efficacious in the treatment of those emotional difficulties most prevalent in cancer survivors. Results suggest that activation and avoidance are the mechanisms responsible for the changes."
1005,16801333,"No study has yet assessed the impact of physicians' skills acquisition after a communication skills training programme on the evolution of patients' anxiety following a medical consultation. This study aimed to compare the impact, on patients' anxiety, of a basic communication skills training programme (BT) and the same programme consolidated by consolidation workshops (CW), and to investigate physicians' communication variables associated with patients' anxiety.","Physicians, after attending the BT, were randomly assigned to CW or to a waiting list. The control group was not a non-intervention group. Consultations with a cancer patient were recorded. Patients' anxiety was assessed with the State Trait Anxiety Inventory before and after a consultation. Communication skills were analysed according to the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop Evaluation Manual.","No statistically significant change over time and between groups was observed. Mixed-effects modelling showed that a decrease in patients' anxiety was linked with screening questions (P = 0.045), physicians' satisfaction about support given (P = 0.004) and with patients' distress (P &lt; 0.001). An increase in anxiety was linked with breaking bad news (P = 0.050) and with supportive skills (P = 0.013). No impact of the training programme was observed.",This study shows the influence of some communication skills on the evolution of patients' anxiety. Physicians should be aware of these influences.
1006,9579004,"In this paper, results are reported from a pilot study designed to test the feasibility of a proactive educational intervention delivered to callers of the Cancer Information Service (CIS).","The study used a randomized two-group design (intervention vs control). Callers assigned to the intervention condition received a brief educational intervention at the end of usual service to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. As part of the intervention, key education messages and materials drawn from the 5 A Day for Better Health program of the National Cancer Institute were provided to CIS callers over the telephone and then reinforced with two follow-up mailings.","Results from this pilot study indicated high levels of adherence to protocol by CIS Information Specialists who delivered the intervention to eligible CIS callers.

1007,11896091,"Vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats, in breast cancer survivors are often worsened by chemotherapy and tamoxifen, and/or the discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy at diagnosis. This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a soy beverage containing phytoestrogens as a treatment for hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.","A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in postmenopausal women with moderate hot flashes who were previously treated for early-stage breast cancer. Women were stratified for tamoxifen use and randomized to a soy beverage (n = 59) containing 90 mg of isoflavones or to a placebo rice beverage (n = 64). Women recorded the number and severity of hot flashes daily with a daily menopause diary for 4 weeks at baseline and for 12 weeks while consuming 500 mL of a soy or placebo beverage.","There were no significant differences between the soy and placebo groups in the number of hot flashes or hot flash scores. However, presumably because of a strong placebo effect, both groups had significant reductions in hot flashes. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were experienced by both groups but occurred with greater frequency and severity with soy. The mean serum genistein concentration at 6 weeks was significantly higher in women who consumed soy (0.61 +/- 0.43 micromol/L) compared with placebo (0.43 +/- 0.37 micromol/L) (P =.02). Overall acceptability and compliance were high and similar in both groups.",The soy beverage did not alleviate hot flashes in women with breast cancer any more than did a placebo. Future research into other compounds is recommended to identify safe and effective therapies for hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.
1008,15216399,Lymphedema of the limbs after cancer therapy is the most common cause of lymphedema in developed countries. There is no cure for chronic cancer-associated lymphedema. Multidisciplinary complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP) is commonly used as a primary treatment. This prospective study assessed the efficacy of intensive CDP treatment in chronic cancer-associated lymphedema.,"Thirty women who had unilateral upper or lower limb chronic lymphedema after breast or pelvic cancer therapy were enrolled in the study. All patients received CDP once per day, in consecutive full treatment sessions, which took place between 4 and 21 times. Assessment of the results of therapy included measuring the circumference, calculated volume, and edema ratio (excess volume/unaffected side volume) of the limb volume. The main outcome measure was the percentage reduction in excess limb volume.","The pretreatment edema ratio demonstrated a high correlation with the patient's age (r = 0.508, p = 0.004) and the duration of the lymphedema (r = 0.634, p &lt; 0.000). After the intensive CDP, the limb circumference, calculated volume, and edema ratio were significantly reduced compared with their pretreatment values (p &lt; 0.000). The mean percentage reduction of excess volume was 67.8 +/- 33.2% in all patients.","Intensive CDP was effectively able to reduce the limb volume of patients with chronic cancer-associated lymphedema.

1009,29448922,"Exposure to sunlight can have both positive and negative health impacts. Excessive exposure to ultra-violet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause skin cancer, however insufficient exposure to sunlight has a detrimental effect on production of Vitamin D. In the construction industry there are onsite proactive behaviours for safety, but sun-safety remains a low priority. There is limited research on understanding the barriers to adopting sun-safe behaviours and the association this may have with Vitamin D production. This paper reports a protocol for an intervention study, using text messaging in combination with a supportive smartphone App. The intervention aims to both reduce UV exposure during months with higher UV levels and promote appropriate dietary changes to boost Vitamin D levels during months with low UV levels.","Approximately 60 construction workers will be recruited across the United Kingdom. A randomised control crossover trial (RCCT) will be used to test the intervention, with randomisation at site level - i.e. participants will receive both the control (no text messages or supportive App support) and intervention (daily text messages and supportive App). Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) the intervention focuses on supporting sun-safety and healthy dietary decisions in relation to Vitamin D intake. The intervention emphasises cultivating the perception of normative support in the workplace, increasing awareness of control and self-efficacy in taking sun-protective behaviours, making healthier eating choices to boost Vitamin D, and tackling stigmas attached to image and group norms. Each study epoch will last 21\u00a0days with intervention text messages delivered on workdays only. The supportive App will provide supplementary information about sun protective behaviours and healthy dietary choices. The primary outcome measure is 25-hydroxy-Vitamin D [25(OH)D] level (obtained using blood spot sampling), which will be taken pre and post control and intervention periods. Secondary outcome measures are two-fold, (1) using the TPB to detect changes in behaviour, and (2) quantifying UV exposure during the UK peak radiation season (April-September) using body-mounted UV sensors.",This study will provide important information about the effectiveness of a technology-based intervention to promote sun-safety and healthy behaviours in outdoor construction workers.,ISRCTN15888934 retrospectively registered 15.01.2018.
1010,21315678,"Many studies have investigated the immediate impact of physical activity on prolactin concentrations; however, it is currently unclear what impact exercise may have on prolactin concentrations in the long-term, particularly among women. Understanding the role of exercise on prolactin is important because epidemiologic studies have reported increased risks of breast cancer in association with high prolactin concentrations. We investigated whether exercise alters serum prolactin concentrations at two time points within a one-year exercise intervention.","Out of 96 women aged 40-75 years, 47 were randomized to a 12-month regimen of moderate-intensity physical activity and 49 were randomized to the control group. Participants in the exercise group (exercisers) took part in exercise at gym facilities 3 times per week and 3 times per week on their own. Serum prolactin was collected from participants at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Using generalized linear models, we compared the percent change in prolactin concentrations from baseline to the two follow-up time points in the exercisers versus the control group.","While we observed the suggestion of differences in the change in serum prolactin concentrations in some subgroups, overall there was no difference in the change in prolactin concentrations between exercisers and controls at 3 months (p=0.57) or 12 months (p=0.42).",Our study does not support the hypothesis that long-term exercise influences serum prolactin concentrations.
1011,10671788,"The aim of this study was to compare a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided sextant biopsy technique, which puts more emphasis on the apical region of the prostate where most prostate carcinomas (PCs) develop, with the standard sextant biopsy technique.","A total of 280 patients with suspected PC were included in this analysis. Twelve biopsy cores were obtained from all patients. Six biopsy cores were taken within a lateral parasagittal plane from each lobe at the apex, middle and basis, with an angle of approximately 45 degrees (technique A), and 6 further biopsy cores were taken from the left to the right lateral margin always penetrating the prostate in the apex with the same angle (socalled fan-shaped technique, technique B). Technique A predominantly samples in the sagittal and technique B samples more in the transversal plane with emphasis on the apical region where most PCs develop. The sensitivity in detecting PCs for both techniques was calculated and correlated to the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.",A total of 72 PCs (25.7%) were diagnosed. We subsequently performed subgroup analysis depending on the serum PSA levels: in patients with a PSA of &lt;/=10 ng/ml (n = 27) technique A has a PC sensitivity of 88.8% (p = 0.037) and technique B 96.2% (p = 0.326) as compared to our reference standard of 100% by sampling 12 biopsy cores in the same prostate. The number of positive biopsy cores using technique B was superior in 12 cases as compared to 3 cases with technique A (p = 0.04). In 12 patients the number of positive biopsy cores was identically. In patients with a PSA of &gt;10 ng/ml (n = 45) technique A has a PC sensitivity of 93.3% (p = 0.083) and technique B 88.8% (p = 0.023) as compared to our reference standard. The number of positive core biopsies using technique A was superior in 14 cases as compared to 12 with technique B (p = 0.154). In 19 patients the number of positive biopsies was identical.,"Our data suggest that in patients with PSA of &lt;/=10 ng/ml technique B bring significant benefit with regard to the number of positive core biopsies, as well as an enhanced PC detection rate which is near the 12-core biopsy. Due to the fact that technique B samples more in the apical region where most cancers develop, it should be performed in suspected early stage cancers of the prostate (PSA&lt;/=10 ng/ml)."
1012,8635129,"Randomized clinical trials have clearly demonstrated that the use of radiation therapy (RT) following breast-conserving surgery (CS) substantially reduces the risk of local recurrence. However, the low rate of local recurrence after CS and RT for patients without known risk factors, and the recent increase in the detection of smaller cancers due to mammographic screening have led to the speculation that a subgroup of patients who have a low risk of local recurrence without RT might be identified. In 1986, we initiated a one-arm, prospective clinical trial of CS alone for treatment of highly selected breast cancer patients without known risk factors for local recurrence.","The study had a sequential design with a planned accrual of 90 patients. Criteria for entry into the trial were: a unicentric, clinical TI infiltrating ductal, mucinous or tubular carcinoma without an extensive intraductal component or lymphatic vessel invasion; a wide excision with a pathologically-documented negative margin of at least 1 cm; and histologically negative axillary lymph nodes. No adjuvant RT or systemic therapy was administered. Seventy-six per cent of the lesions were detected by mammography alone. The median gross pathologic tumor size was 0.9 cm. The median patient age was 67 years.","Eighty-seven patients were enrolled in the trial before it closed prematurely in 1992 because the predefined stopping boundary was crossed (i.e., the sixth local recurrence was observed). At that time, the average annual local recurrence rate was 4.2%. With a median follow-up of 56 months, there are now 14 patients (16%) with local recurrence as their site of first failure (average annual local recurrence rate: 3.6%). Four patients without local recurrence developed distant metastases. Three patients have died, one of metastatic breast cancer and two of unrelated causes.","Even in a highly selected group of patients with early-stage breast cancer, there is a substantial risk of early local recurrence for those treated with wide excision alone."

The importance of physical activity on the health of childhood ALL survivors should be emphasized. Longer, controlled studies are needed to confirm our findings."
1016,15139072,"Research suggests that stress-reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life. Yoga, an ancient Eastern science, incorporates stress-reduction techniques that include regulated breathing, visual imagery, and meditation as well as various postures. The authors examined the effects of the Tibetan yoga (TY) practices of Tsa lung and Trul khor, which incorporate controlled breathing and visualization, mindfulness techniques, and low-impact postures in patients with lymphoma.","Thirty-nine patients with lymphoma who were undergoing treatment or who had concluded treatment within the past 12 months were assigned to a TY group or to a wait-list control group. Patients in the TY group participated in 7 weekly yoga sessions, and patients in the wait-list control group were free to participate in the TY program after the 3-month follow-up assessment.","Eighty nine percent of TY participants completed at least 2-3 three yoga sessions, and 58% completed at least 5 sessions. Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; P &lt; 0.004). This included better subjective sleep quality (P &lt; 0.02), faster sleep latency (P &lt; 0.01), longer sleep duration (P &lt; 0.03), and less use of sleep medications (P &lt; 0.02). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance, state anxiety, depression, or fatigue.","The participation rates suggested that a TY program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep-related outcomes. However, there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes."
1017,17998547,To identify factors that condition or moderate the impact of a previously described set of interventions on psychological and physical adjustment after diagnosis and treatment for early-stage breast cancer.,"Younger women (age &lt; 51 years, N = 252) with early-stage breast cancer within 2 months of having completed active nonhormonal adjuvant therapy were randomly assigned to a three-arm clinical trial, consisting of a control arm, an education arm, and a nutrition arm. Primary end points, assessed before random assignment and 4 and 13 months later, included mental functioning, physical functioning, and depressive symptoms. Four types of moderator variables were identified, including two sets reflecting psychosocial resources, specifically personality factors and factors related to the person's social environment, a set reflecting demographic variables, and a set reflecting treatment and disease variables (including comorbidities).","Psychosocial factors were more likely to moderate treatment effects than were demographic and disease-related factors, but the moderating effects of these psychosocial factors were limited to patients receiving the nutrition intervention. Patients with lower psychosocial resources benefited from the nutrition intervention, whereas patients with a greater amount of psychosocial resources did not.","Future trials of this type should stratify by or select for the moderating variables identified here (ie, dispositional pessimism, unmitigated communion, and negative social interaction) to establish more firmly their role in responses to psychosocial interventions. Effort should also be made to collect data to inform the delivery of interventions to those who might benefit the most."
1018,11304773,"An estimated 42% of cancer patients suffer from poorly controlled pain, in part because of patient-related barriers to pain control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an individualized education and coaching intervention on pain outcomes and pain-related knowledge among outpatients with cancer-related pain.","English-speaking cancer patients (18 to 75 years old) with moderate pain over the past 2 weeks were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 34) or control group (n = 33). Experimental patients received a 20-minute individualized education and coaching session to increase knowledge of pain self-management, to redress personal misconceptions about pain treatment, and to rehearse an individually scripted patient-physician dialog about pain control. The control group received standardized instruction on controlling pain. Data on average pain, functional impairment as a result of pain, pain frequency, and pain-related knowledge were collected at enrollment and 2-week follow-up.","At baseline, there were no significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of average pain, functional impairment as a result of pain, pain frequency, or pain-related knowledge. At follow-up, average pain severity improved significantly more among experimental group patients than among control patients (P =.014). The intervention had no statistically significant impact on functional impairment as a result of pain, pain frequency, or pain-related knowledge.","Compared with provision of standard educational materials and counseling, a brief individualized education and coaching intervention for outpatients with cancer-related pain was associated with improvement in average pain levels. Larger studies are needed to validate these effects and elucidate their mechanisms."
1019,30332430,"Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence among colon cancer patients. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are prognostic of disease recurrence among stage I-III colon cancer patients. The pathways through which physical activity may alter disease outcomes are unknown, but may be mediated by changes in CTCs.","Participants included 23 stage I-III colon cancer patients randomized into one of three groups: usual-care control, 150 min\u2219wk-1 of aerobic exercise (low-dose), and 300 min\u2219wk-1 of aerobic exercise (high-dose) for six months. CTCs from venous blood were quantified in a blinded fashion using an established microfluidic antibody-mediated capture device. Poisson regression models estimated the logarithmic counts of CTCs.","At baseline, 78% (18/23) of patients had \u22651 CTC. At baseline, older age (-0.12\u00b10.06; P = 0.04), lymphovascular invasion (0.63\u00b10.25; P = 0.012), moderate/poor histology (1.09\u00b10.34; P = 0.001), body mass index (0.07\u00b10.02; P = 0.001), visceral adipose tissue (0.08\u00b10.04; P = 0.036), insulin (0.06\u00b10.02; P = 0.011), sICAM-1 (0.04\u00b10.02; P = 0.037), and sVCAM-1 (0.06\u00b10.03; P = 0.045) were associated with CTCs. Over six months, significant decreases in CTCs were observed in the low-dose (-1.34\u00b10.34; P&lt;0.001) and high-dose (-1.18\u00b10.40; P = 0.004) exercise groups, whereas no significant change was observed in the control group (-0.59\u00b10.56; P = 0.292). Over six months, reductions in body mass index (-0.07\u00b10.02; P = 0.007), insulin (-0.08\u00b10.03; P = 0.014), and sICAM-1 (-0.07\u00b10.03; P = 0.005) were associated with reductions in CTCs. The main limitations of this proof-of-concept study are the small sample size, heterogenous population, and per-protocol statistical analysis.",Exercise may reduce CTCs among stage I-III colon cancer patients. Changes in host factors correlated with changes in CTCs. Exercise may have a direct effect on CTCs and indirect effects through alterations in host factors. This hypothesis-generating observation derived from a small pilot study warrants further investigation and replication.
1020,26051568,This pilot study evaluated whether acupressure affected the postoperative comfort of gastric cancer patients following a subtotal gastrectomy.,A randomised controlled trial was conducted. Sixty patients were recruited from 141-bed general surgery ward at a 3000-bed medical centre in Northern Taiwan. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group receiving regular postoperative care or to the experimental group receiving additional acupressure at acupoints of Neiquan (P6) and Zusanli (ST36) for 3 consecutive days.,"The similarities between two groups were in postoperative pain and the onset of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) at the baseline. Following acupressure, significant differences were found in postoperative pain (P=.03) and time of first flatus (P=.04); but not PONV (P=.49), nor the time of first defecation (P=.34).","Acupressure is a simple, noninvasive, safe, and economical procedure for improving the comfort of patients who undergo surgery for gastric cancer. Acupressure at the P6 and ST36 acupoints can improve postoperative comfort by alleviating pain and decreasing the time until first flatus. However, additional research is necessary to elucidate how acupressure can improve postoperative outcomes."
1021,25749601,"The primary aims of this hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial were to quantitatively assess whether an evidence-based exercise intervention for breast cancer survivors, Strength After Breast Cancer, was safe and effective in a new setting and to qualitatively assess barriers to implementation.","A cohort of 84 survivors completed measurements related to limb volume, muscle strength, and body image at baseline, 67 survivors completed measurements 12 months later. Qualitative methods were used to understand barriers to implementation experienced by referring oncology clinicians and physical therapists who delivered the program.","Similar to the efficacy trial, the revised intervention demonstrated safety with regard to lymphedema, and led to improvements in lymphedema symptoms, muscular strength, and body image. Comparison of effects in the effectiveness trial to effects in the efficacy trial revealed larger strength increases in the efficacy trial than in the effectiveness trial (P &lt; .04), but few other differences were found. Qualitative implementation data suggested significant barriers around intervention characteristics, payment, eligibility criteria, the referral process, the need for champions (ie, advocates), and the need to adapt during implementation of the intervention, which should be considered in future dissemination and implementation efforts.","This trial successfully demonstrated that a physical therapy led strength training program for breast cancer survivors can be implemented in a community setting while retaining the effectiveness and safety of the clinical trial. However, during the translation process, strategies to reduce barriers to implementation are required. This new program can inform larger scale dissemination and implementation efforts."
1022,27503036,"Prostate cancer treatment often results in significant psycho-sexual challenges for men following treatment; however, many men report difficulty in accessing appropriate care.","A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to assess the efficacy of a 10-week self-guided online psychological intervention called My Road Ahead (MRA) for men with localized prostate cancer in improving sexual satisfaction. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 conditions MRA alone or MRA plus online forum, or forum access alone. Pre, post, and follow-up assessments of overall sexual satisfaction were conducted. Mixed models and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the data.","One hundred forty-two men (mean age 61\u00a0y; SD\u00a0=\u00a07) participated. The majority of participants had undergone radical prostatectomy (88%) and all men had received treatment for localized prostate cancer. Significant differences were obtained for the 3 groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.026) and a significant improvement in total sexual satisfaction was observed only for participants who were allocated to MRA\u00a0+\u00a0forum with a large effect size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004, partial \u03b7 \u00a0=\u00a00.256). Structural equation modeling indicated that increases in sexual function, masculine self-esteem, and sexual confidence contributed significantly to overall sexual satisfaction for the MRA\u00a0+\u00a0forum plus forum condition.","This study is the first, to our knowledge, that has evaluated a self-guided online psychological intervention tailored to the specific needs of men with prostate cancer. The findings indicate the potential for MRA to deliver support that men may not otherwise receive and also highlight the importance of psychological intervention to facilitate improved sexual outcomes."
1023,23576267,Current treatments for lymphedema after breast cancer treatment are expensive and require ongoing intervention. Clinical experience and our preliminary published results suggest that acupuncture is safe and potentially useful. This study evaluates the safety and potential efficacy of acupuncture on upper-limb circumference in women with lymphedema.,"Women with a clinical diagnosis of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) for 0.5-5 years and with affected arm circumference \u22652 cm larger than unaffected arm received acupuncture treatment twice weekly for 4 weeks. Affected and unaffected arm circumferences were measured before and after each acupuncture treatment. Response, defined as \u226530% reduction in circumference difference between affected/unaffected arms, was assessed. Monthly follow-up calls for 6 months thereafter were made to document any complications and self-reported lymphedema status.","Among 37 enrolled patients, 33 were evaluated; 4 discontinued due to time constraints. Mean reduction in arm circumference difference was 0.90 cm (95% CI, 0.72-1.07; P &lt; .0005). Eleven patients (33%) exhibited a reduction of \u226530% after acupuncture treatment. Seventy-six percent of patients received all treatments; 21% missed 1 treatment, and another patient missed 2 treatments. During the treatment period, 14 of the 33 patients reported minor complaints, including mild local bruising or pain/tingling. There were no serious adverse events and no infections or severe exacerbations after 255 treatment sessions and 6 months of follow-up interviews.","Acupuncture for BCRL appears safe and may reduce arm circumference. Although these results await confirmation in a randomized trial, acupuncture can be considered for women with no other options for sustained arm circumference reduction."
1024,11879269,The purpose of this study was to determine whether participation in a group psychosocial intervention by patients with breast cancer would result in an improvement in psychological measures and in reduced billings in general medical expenses.,"Eligible women who had completed treatment for stage 0, I, or II primary breast cancer were prospectively and randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=46) or control (n=43) group. Both groups received the usual psychosocial care; however, the intervention group also participated in six weekly cognitive/behavioral psychosocial meetings. All were assessed on psychiatric symptoms, mood, depression, and coping strategies at four time periods: pre-intervention, post-intervention, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up. Alberta Healthcare billing records were obtained covering the 2-year follow-up period to determine the amount billed per person over the course of the study.","Women in the intervention group had less depression, less overall mood disturbance, better overall quality of life, and fewer psychiatric symptoms than those in the control group, beginning immediately post-intervention and remaining so at 2 years post-intervention. Billing in the intervention group was an average of $147 less than in the control group, a 23.5% reduction.","This is the first study to show that a psychosocial intervention can reduce direct healthcare billings in a sample of patients with cancer. Importantly, these findings help to justify the routine availability of such programs in cancer treatment facilities worldwide."
1025,12743147,To evaluate the effect of a standardized group psychosocial intervention on health-related quality of life (HrQOL) in women with metastatic breast cancer and to explore the effect of missing data in HrQOL analyses.,"Between 1993 and 1998, seven Canadian centers randomly assigned 235 eligible women to participate in a weekly, 90-minute, therapist-led support group that adhered to principles of supportive-expressive (SE) therapy or to a control arm (no SE). All women received educational material and any type of medical or psychosocial care deemed necessary. HrQOL data were prospectively collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. The primary HrQOL analyses compared scores in the two study arms. Analyses were limited to women with appropriate baseline HrQOL information (n = 215).","Baseline EORTC QLQ-C30 scores were not different between the two study arms (all P &gt;.05). Primary analysis of all subscales failed to show a significant influence of the intervention on HrQOL (all P &gt;.05). There was a significant deterioration over time in several functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30: global (P =.03), physical (P =.0002), role (P =.01), and cognitive functioning (P =.04); and in symptom scales: dyspnea (P =.007), appetite loss (P =.04), and fatigue (P =.003); these changes were independent of randomization allocation. Results were similar in additional analyses of overall HrQOL using a variety of approaches to handling missing data.","Supportive-expressive group therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer does not appear to influence HrQOL, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30."

Although some have been investigated in small, phase II studies, this combination has never been evaluated within an adequately powered randomised controlled trial.","In total, 199 men, average age 74 years, with localised prostate cancer, 60% managed with primary active surveillance (AS) or 40% with watchful waiting (WW) following previous interventions, were randomised (2:1) to receive an oral capsule containing a blend of pomegranate, green tea, broccoli and turmeric, or an identical placebo for 6 months.","The median rise in PSA in the food supplement group (FSG) was 14.7% (95% confidence intervals (CIs) 3.4-36.7%), as opposed to 78.5% in the placebo group (PG) (95% CI 48.1-115.5%), difference 63.8% (P=0.0008). In all, 8.2% of men in the FSG and 27.7% in the PG opted to leave surveillance at the end of the intervention (\u03c72 P=0.014). There were no significant differences within the predetermined subgroups of age, Gleason grade, treatment category or body mass index. There were no differences in cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, C-reactive protein or adverse events.","This study found a significant short-term, favourable effect on the percentage rise in PSA in men managed with AS and WW following ingestion of this well-tolerated, specific blend of concentrated foods. Its influence on decision-making suggests that this intervention is clinically meaningful, but further trials will evaluate longer term clinical effects, and other makers of disease progression."
1027,10861309,"Preclinical evidence suggests that retinoids and antioxidants may prevent or delay the occurrence of cancer in the upper or lower airways, but such effects have not been reliably established in clinical studies. To assess the chemopreventive effects of vitamin A (retinyl palmitate) and N-acetylcysteine, we conducted a large randomized intervention study in patients with head and neck cancer or with lung cancer, most of whom had a history of smoking.","From June 1988 through July 1994, a total of 2592 patients (60% with head and neck cancer and 40% with lung cancer) were randomly assigned to receive 1) retinyl palmitate (300000 IU daily for 1 year followed by 150000 IU for a 2(nd) year), 2) N-acetylcysteine (600 mg daily for 2 years), 3) both compounds, or 4) no intervention. All statistical tests were two-sided.","Of the patients, 93.5% had smoked tobacco at sometime in their lives (and 25% continued to smoke after cancer diagnosis). After a median follow-up of 49 months, 916 patients were reported with an event (recurrence, second primary tumor, or death). No statistically significant difference was observed in overall survival or event-free survival between patients who received retinyl palmitate and patients who did not. Similarly, no difference was seen in overall survival or event-free survival between patients who received N-acetylcysteine and patients who did not. There was a lower incidence of second primary tumors in the no intervention arm, but the difference was not statistically significant.","A 2-year supplementation of retinyl palmitate and/or N-acetylcysteine resulted in no benefit-in terms of survival, event-free survival, or second primary tumors-for patients with head and neck cancer or with lung cancer, most of whom were previous or current smokers."
1028,16916540,"Women that have a first-degree relative diagnosed with breast cancer at an early age are at increased risk of the disease, yet they often lack information about their personal risk of breast cancer and early detection measures. An intervention to provide objective risk information, reduce worries, and promote screening and healthy behaviors was developed.","In 1999-2002, a randomized pre-post design was used to test a tailored telephone counseling intervention with a sample of 163 women whose sisters were diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50 or younger in the San Francisco Bay Area. Participants were interviewed by telephone regarding their breast cancer risk factors, perceived risk, worries, lifestyle factors, and screening behavior. A modified Gail model was used to compute an objective measure of individualized lifetime risk.","Risk overestimates averaged 25 percentage points. The intervention was effective in reducing overestimates in women age 50 and over but not in those under 50. The intervention was effective in increasing physical activity and reinforcing the conviction to maintain good breast health, but not in decreasing worries or increasing screening.",Telephone counseling appears to be a viable tool for reducing risk overestimates and promoting healthy behaviors among sisters of women with breast cancer.
1029,21457725,"The population benefit of screening depends not only on the effectiveness of the test, but also on adherence, which, for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening remains low. An advance notification letter may increase adherence, however, no population-based randomized trials have been conducted to provide evidence of this.","In 2008, a representative sample of the Dutch population (aged 50-74 years) was randomized. All 2493 invitees in group A were sent an advance notification letter, followed two weeks later by a standard invitation. The 2507 invitees in group B only received the standard invitation. Non-respondents in both groups were sent a reminder 6 weeks after the invitation.","The advance notification letters resulted in a significantly higher adherence (64.4% versus 61.1%, p-value 0.019). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no significant interactions between group and age, sex, or socio-economic status. Cost analysis showed that the incremental cost per additional detected advanced neoplasia due to sending an advance notification letter was \u20ac 957.",This population-based randomized trial demonstrates that sending an advance notification letter significantly increases adherence by 3.3%. The incremental cost per additional detected advanced neoplasia is acceptable. We therefore recommend that such letters are incorporated within the standard CRC-screening invitation process.
1030,10326708,Fatigue is a common and often severe problem in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The authors postulated that physical activity training can reduce the intensity of fatigue in this group of patients.,A group of cancer patients receiving high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (training group; n = 27) followed an exercise program during hospitalization. The program was comprised of biking on an ergometer in the supine position following an interval training pattern for 30 minutes daily. Patients in the control group (n = 32) did not train. Psychologic distress was assessed at hospital admission and discharge with the Profile of Mood States and Symptom Check List 90.,"By the time of hospital discharge, fatigue and somatic complaints had increased significantly in the control group (P for both &lt; 0.01) but not in the training group. Furthermore, by the time of hospital discharge, the training group had a significant improvement in several scores of psychologic distress (obsessive-compulsive traits, fear, interpersonal sensitivity, and phobic anxiety) (P value for all scores &lt; 0.05); this outcome was not observed in the control group.",The current study found that aerobic exercise can reduce fatigue and improve psychologic distress in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
1031,19221190,Calcium and vitamin D (CaD) supplementation trials including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of CaD have shown nonsignificant reductions in total mortality. This report examines intervention effects on total and cause-specific mortality by age and adherence.,"The WHI CaD trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 36,282 postmenopausal women aged 51-82 years from 40 U.S. clinical centers. Women were assigned to 1,000 mg of elemental calcium carbonate and 400 IU of vitamin D(3) daily or placebo with average follow-up of 7.0 years.","The hazard ratio (HR) for total mortality was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-1.01) with 744 deaths in women randomized to CaD versus 807 deaths in the placebo group. HRs were in the direction of reduced risk but nonsignificant for stroke and cancer mortality, but near unity for coronary heart disease and other causes of death. HRs for total mortality were 0.89 in the 29,942 women younger than 70 years (95% CI, 0.79-1.01) and 0.95 in the 6,340 women aged 70 and older (95% CI, 0.80-1.12; p value for age interaction = .10). No statistically significant interactions were observed for any baseline characteristics. Treatment effects did not vary significantly by season.","In the WHI CaD trial, supplementation did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality rates but the findings support the possibility that these supplements may reduce mortality rates in postmenopausal women. These data can neither support nor refute recommendations for higher dose vitamin D supplementation to reduce cancer or total mortality."
1032,16165701,"The influence of irradiation on the clinical severity of incontinence, sphincter function, morphologic features and short/long-term treatment effects of sphincter training therapy is still insufficiently understood in irradiated patients with fecal incontinence after surgery for colorectal cancer. These parameters were compared in irradiated and non-irradiated patients and followed prospectively with regard to short- and long-term training effects.","Forty-one patients having been irradiated after surgery (50.0+/-5.0 Gy) and 54 non-irradiated patients with fecal incontinence participated in this prospective, non-randomized trial. Baseline evaluation included a semiquantitative severity assessment score of fecal incontinence (modified Cleveland Incontinence Score (MCIS)), rectal manometry and endoscopy. After 3 weeks (short term) of intensive in-hospital pelvic floor exercise combined with biofeedback training, a second evaluation was made. In addition, anal endosonography (EUS) was performed in cases of treatment failure. After one year (long term) a third evaluation was made clinically (MCIS score).","Irradiated patients presented with a significantly higher degree of fecal incontinence (lower MCIS) compared to non-irradiated patients: 7.4+/-2.2 versus 8.7+/-2.7 points (p&lt;0.001). Rectosigmoidal inflammation was more frequent in irradiated than non-irradiated patients (26.9% versus 9.3%) (p&lt;0.03). Sphincter pressure, sensation/pain threshold and the rectoanal inhibitory reflex were similar in both groups. A significant short-term training effect was observed in both groups following sphincter training therapy in terms of an increase in MCIS from 7.4+/-2.2 to 9.4+/-2.7 points in the irradiated group and from 8.7+/-2.7 to 11.4+/-2.5 points in the non-irradiated group (p&lt;0.0001). After one year the scores were 8.2+/-3.8 and 10.7+/-4.4 points, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). There was a significant correlation (p&lt;0.001) between baseline MCIS and the short- and long-term MCIS. In patients with short-term treatment failure (16.6%) anal EUS revealed structural defects of the external sphincter in four patients. There was no association of sphincter diameter with sphincter pressure, sensation/pain threshold and short/long-term MCIS.",The main result of this study is that irradiated patients show short- and long-term training effects comparable with those of non-irradiated patients despite the higher degree of incontinence at baseline. The correlation between the initial MCIS and short- and long-term treatment effects may be regarded as an important clinical predictor for treatment outcome. Functional and morphologic features are less suitable for this purpose.
1033,28963591,"Physical activity is supposed to decrease mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) and is suggested to reduce side-effects of the disease and its treatment. However, the knowledge about the influence of exercise interventions on patients suffering from CRC and metastasized CRC (mCRC) is still sparse. One frequently observed side effect in mCRC is chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). This randomized controlled trial investigated the influence of a supervised exercise program on CIPN in mCRC.","Thirty patients (stage IV) undergoing outpatient palliative treatment including a median of 23.5 chemotherapy cycles of various regimens were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group (IG, n\u00a0=\u00a017; CG, n\u00a0=\u00a013). The IG participated in an eight-week supervised exercise program, including endurance, resistance and balance training (2\u00d7/week for 60\u00a0min) whereas the CG received written standard recommendations to obtain physical fitness. CIPN was assessed using the FACT/GOG-NTX questionnaire. Moreover, endurance capacity (6MWT), strength (h1RM) and balance (GGT-Reha) were evaluated before (t ) and after (t ) the intervention as well as after 4\u00a0weeks follow-up (t).","Neuropathic symptoms remained stable in the IG over time, while CIPN significantly worsened in the CG from t  to t  and t  to t . In contrast to the CG, the IG significantly improved in strength and balance function. Changes in CIPN correlated with changes in balance.","This is the first investigation showing positive effects of a multimodal exercise program on CIPN, balance and strength on mCRC patients in a palliative setting, thereby consequently increasing patients` quality of life. The results support earlier findings stating a positive influence of balance exercise on CIPN."
1034,17980503,To evaluate the impact of zinc supplementation on the survival of patients after receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancers.,"Patients were randomly divided into two groups; experimental and control. Patients in the experimental group received a predetermined dose of a zinc supplement, and the control group, a placebo. The 50 patients in each group could be considered homogenous with respect to medical histories, tumor characteristics, and therapeutic details.","Patients in both groups appeared to have similar results for 3-year overall, disease-free, and metastases-free survival rates (p = 0.19, p = 0.54, and p = 0.35, respectively). However, patients in the experimental group had better 3-year local-free survival (LFS), although the difference was only marginal (p = 0.092). Another difference was that patients in the experimental group with Stages III-IV disease had a much better 3-year LFS rate when they received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (p = 0.003).",One impact seen was that zinc supplementation improved LFS at 3 years after beginning treatment for patients with Stages III-IV disease. It is imperative that these patients be followed up for a longer period to draw a definite conclusion.
1035,26509172,To test the effectiveness of a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening intervention among adults living in Ohio Appalachia.,"We conducted a group-randomized trial of a county-level intervention among adults living in 12 Ohio Appalachian counties who received a media campaign and clinic intervention focused on either CRC screening or fruits and vegetables. Participants' percentage within CRC screening guidelines was assessed with cross-sectional surveys conducted annually for four years, and validated with medical record review of screening.","On average, screening data were obtained on 564 intervention and 559 comparison participants per year. There was no difference in the Wave 4 CRC screening rates of intervention and comparison counties (35.2% versus 31.4%). Multivariate analyses found that high perceived risk of CRC, willingness to have a CRC test if recommended by a doctor, doctor recommendation of a CRC screening test, and patient-physician communication about changes in bowel habits, family history of CRC, and eating fruits and vegetables were significant (p &lt; 0.05) predictors of being within CRC screening guidelines.",The intervention was not effective in increasing CRC rates among Ohio Appalachian adults. Future research should determine how media and clinic-based interventions can be modified to improve CRC screening rates among this underserved population.
1036,11879271,The purpose of this article is to report the main learning outcomes of the Lake Superior Rural Cancer Care Project.,"The authors designed and tested a multimodal intervention directed at rural providers and their healthcare systems in a large rural area in the north central United States. An experimental design was used to randomize rural providers at the group level. The intervention consisted of providing increased education for rural providers with a number of approaches, including the use of clinical opinion leaders. The main outcome of the intervention was knowledge scoring on discipline-specific cancer management tests.","Knowledge scores for providers in the experimental group significantly increased from pretest to post-test: 66 to 79 for physicians (and physician assistants) (P=.02); 58 to 71 for nurses (P=.01); and 54 to 64 for pharmacists (P=.01). At post-test, participating providers in the experimental group performed significantly better on the knowledge tests (P &lt;.01) than those in the control groups.","This study may be the first to test educational interventions to improve rural providers' knowledge about cancer practice using an experimental design. The intervention may possibly change provider practice behaviors and, thus, patient outcomes, data that will be reported in a future issue. Finally, this educational intervention may prove useful for providers in other rural areas."
1037,17291319,"Treatment of childhood cancer occurs over a 2- to 3-year period, with initial intense phases of chemotherapy followed by less severe treatment periods. From first diagnosis, families are encouraged by healthcare professionals (following government guidelines) to try to maintain a normal life. The aim of this paper is to contribute to our understanding of how 'normal' family life is compromised from the perspective of the families themselves during this period of extreme stress and concern for the health and well-being of their child.","This study was longitudinal and involved a cross section of 32 mothers of children recently diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) currently participating in the Medical Research Council ALL-97 randomized control trial. Mothers were interviewed at three time points (3-4 months post diagnosis, 15 and 27 months) using a semi-structured format with open-ended questions. A qualitative methodology was employed to analyse interview data using Thematic analysis.","Mothers reported understanding the importance of achieving normal life, but described how this was difficult to realize. At first interview, mothers were optimistic that they could achieve the 'normal life' as advised by healthcare workers. At 12 and 24 months, although all mothers reported that life was not back to normal, there were differences in how they perceived this lack of normality. Whereas some families experienced frustration and disappointment, others had adjusted and managed to accept the new order.","Families felt encouraged on diagnosis to be told that despite the severity of the disease and treatment regime, a normal life was possible and should be pursued. Our findings indicate that over time, more concrete information is needed to guide parents through the treatment process in order to help them achieve this."

Excess visceral adipose tissue is associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence among colon cancer survivors. The pathways through which physical activity may alter disease outcomes are unknown, but may be mediated by changes in visceral adipose tissue.","Thirty-nine stage I-III colon cancer survivors were randomised to one of three groups: usual-care control, 150\u2009min\u2009wk of aerobic exercise (low dose) and 300\u2009min\u2009wk of aerobic exercise (high dose) for 6 months. The prespecified key body composition outcome was visceral adipose tissue quantified using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.","Exercise reduced visceral adipose tissue in dose-response fashion (P=0.008).

Visceral adipose tissue may be a mechanism through which exercise reduces the risk of disease recurrence among colon cancer survivors.
1039,27156228,Dyspnoea is one of the commonest symptoms of lung cancer. Opioids can reduce dyspnoea. This study investigates acupuncture for relief of breathlessness in lung cancer.,"We performed a single-centre, randomised phase II study of 173 patients with non-small cell lung cancer\u00a0or mesothelioma with dyspnoea score of \u22654 on visual analogue scale (VAS). Randomisation was to acupuncture alone (A), morphine alone (M) or both (AM). Acupuncture was administered at upper sternal, thoracic paravertebral, trapezius trigger points and LI4. Manubrial semi-permanent acupuncture studs were inserted and massaged when symptomatic. Arm A patients received rescue morphine. Primary end-point was proportion of patients achieving \u22651.5 improvement in VAS dyspnoea at 4\u00a0h. Measurements continued to day 14 and included VAS relaxation, line analogue rating (Lar) anxiety, hospital anxiety and depression and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life scores.","Dyspnoea VAS improved \u22651.5 in 74%, 60% and 66% of arms A, M and AM, respectively, and was maintained in 45% at 2 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference between arms. VAS relaxation improved in arms A (1.06 points) and AM (1.48 points) compared to arm M (-0.19 points, p&lt;0.001). At 7 d, the Lar anxiety score improved in arm A (1.5 points), arm AM (1.2 points) and arm M (no change, p=0.003). Fewer patients received at least one morphine dose in arm A compared with arm M or AM (21% versus 87% versus 87%, respectively, p&lt;0.001).","A, M and AM were effective in relieving dyspnoea. Acupuncture relieved anxiety and was morphine sparing, providing an alternative to morphine."
1040,24217994,"Greater mental health symptomatology of Latina breast cancer (LBC) patients along with the paucity of intervention trials to reduce distress underscores the scientific and practice gaps in comprehensive care. This trial investigated the effect of a paraprofessionally delivered, telephonic-based psycho-educational intervention on depressive symptoms among LBC patients.","Latina breast cancer patients were recruited from the California Cancer Registry, hospital registries, and support groups. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition. The primary outcome was level of depressive symptoms as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale.","One hundred ninety-nine LBC patients (84 English language preferred and 115 Spanish language preferred) participated. The overall trial outcomes demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in depressive symptoms among LBC patients in the intervention condition compared with LBC patients in the control condition, after controlling for depressive symptoms at T1 and language (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). At follow-up, 63% of intervention LBC patients reported at least a five-point decrease in symptoms compared with 26% of control LBC patients (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05). English language-preferred and Spanish language-preferred LBC patients in the intervention condition showed approximately an eight-point mean decrease in depressive symptoms from baseline (M\u2009=\u200923.5 and M\u2009=\u200926.6, respectively) to follow-up (M\u2009=\u200915.7 and M\u2009=\u200918.4, respectively) (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), whereas those in the control condition showed no significant change.","Results demonstrate the effectiveness of a culturally responsive, paraprofessionally delivered intervention to reduce depressive symptoms among LBC patients. Therefore, community oncology practices can affiliate with trained paraprofessionals to implement mental health services to address distress among our growing and increasingly ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse oncology patient population."
1041,12760241,"Workplace cancer prevention initiatives have been least successful with blue-collar workers. This study assesses whether an intervention integrating health promotion with occupational health and safety results in significant and meaningful increases in smoking cessation and consumption of fruits and vegetables, compared to a standard health promotion intervention, for workers overall and for blue-collar workers in particular.","A randomized controlled design was used, with 15 manufacturing worksites assigned to a health promotion (HP) or a health promotion plus occupational health and safety intervention (HP/OHS), and compared from baseline (1997) to final (1999). The response rates to the survey were 80% at baseline (n = 9019) and 65% at final (n = 7327). Both groups targeted smoking and diet; the HP/OHS condition additionally incorporated reduction of occupational exposures.","Smoking quit rates among blue-collar workers in the HP/OHS condition more than doubled relative to those in the HP condition (OR = 2.13, p = 0.04), and were comparable to quit rates of white-collar workers. No statistically significant differences between groups were found for mean changes in fruits and vegetables.",Integration of occupational health and safety and health promotion may be an essential means of enhancing the effectiveness of worksite tobacco control initiatives with blue-collar workers.

Data were collected through a postal questionnaire at entry into a genetic risk assessment programme and 1 month later.","Analysis of covariance revealed a nonsignificant reduction in distress in all women, and a significant reduction of distress among those with high baseline stress, who received the intervention. No gains were found among the control group. Measures of emotional response while thinking about cancer genetic assessment suggested these benefits were achieved in the absence of any rebound emotional response.","The intervention offers a low-cost effective coping intervention, which could be integrated into existing services with minimal disruption and may also be appropriate for other periods of waiting and uncertainty."
1043,26542272,"Fatigue is a prevalent, distressing side effect of cancer and cancer treatment which commonly coexists with insomnia. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to improve insomnia in cancer patients, but less is known about its ability to impact fatigue. This work is the analysis for a secondary aim of a four-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) study assessing the combined and comparative effect of CBT-I and a wakefulness-promoting agent, armodafinil (A), to improve sleep and daytime functioning in cancer survivors. Herein, we examine the effect of CBT-I, with and without A, on fatigue in cancer survivors.",This study was a four-arm factorial study with CBTI-I (yes/no) versus A (yes/no). It consisted of 96 cancer survivors (average age 56 years; 88 % female; 68 % breast cancer). Fatigue was assessed by the brief fatigue inventory (BFI) and the FACIT-Fatigue scale. The analysis assessed the additive effects of CBT-I and A and possible non-additive effects where the effect of CBT-I changes depending on the presence or absence of A.,"Analyses adjusting for baseline differences showed that CBT-I improved fatigue as measured by two separate scales (BFI: P\u2009=\u20090.002, Std. error\u2009=\u20090.32, effect size (ES)\u2009=\u20090.46; FACIT-Fatigue: P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001, Std. error\u2009=\u20091.74, ES\u2009=\u20090.64). Armodafinil alone did not show a statistically significant effect on fatigue levels (all Ps\u2009&gt;\u20090.40) nor did the drug influence the efficacy of CBT-I. Structural equation analysis revealed that reductions in insomnia severity were directly responsible for improving cancer-related fatigue.","CBT-I with and without armodafinil resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction of subjective daytime fatigue in cancer survivors with chronic insomnia. Armodafinil did not improve cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and did not change the efficacy of CBT-I. Patients reporting CRF should be screened and, if indicated, treated for insomnia as part of a comprehensive fatigue management program."
1044,15667973,To determine whether hypnotherapy reduces anxiety and improves the quality of life in cancer patients undergoing curative radiotherapy (RT).,"After providing written informed consent, 69 patients were randomized between standard curative RT alone (36 controls) and RT plus hypnotherapy (33 patients). Patients in the hypnotherapy group received hypnotherapy at the intake, before RT simulation, before the first RT session, and halfway between the RT course. Anxiety was evaluated by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory DY-1 form at six points. Quality of life was measured by the Rand Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) at five points. Additionally, patients answered a questionnaire to evaluate their experience and the possible benefits of this research project.","No statistically significant difference was found in anxiety or quality of life between the hypnotherapy and control groups. However, significantly more patients in the hypnotherapy group indicated an improvement in mental (p &lt;0.05) and overall (p &lt;0.05) well-being.","Hypnotherapy did not reduce anxiety or improve the quality of life in cancer patients undergoing curative RT. The absence of statistically significant differences between the two groups contrasts with the hypnotherapy patients' own sense of mental and overall well-being, which was significantly greater after hypnotherapy. It cannot be excluded that the extra attention by the hypnotherapist was responsible for this beneficial effect in the hypnotherapy group. An attention-only control group would be necessary to control for this effect."
1045,15812073,"Although low dietary intakes of antioxidant vitamins and minerals have been associated with higher risks of cancer, results of trials testing antioxidant supplementation for cancer chemoprevention have been equivocal. We assessed whether supplementation with antioxidant vitamins could reduce the incidence of second primary cancers among patients with head and neck cancer.","We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized chemoprevention trial among 540 patients with stage I or II head and neck cancer treated by radiation therapy between October 1, 1994, and June 6, 2000. Supplementation with alpha-tocopherol (400 IU/day) and beta-carotene (30 mg/day) or placebo began on the first day of radiation therapy and continued for 3 years after the end of radiation therapy. In the course of the trial, beta-carotene supplementation was discontinued after 156 patients had enrolled because of ethical concerns. The remaining patients received alpha-tocopherol or placebo only. Survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided.","After a median follow-up of 52 months, second primary cancers and recurrences of the first tumor were diagnosed in 113 and 119 participants, respectively. The effect of supplementation on the incidence of second primary cancers varied over time. Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving alpha-tocopherol supplements had a higher rate of second primary cancers during the supplementation period (HR = 2.88, 95% CI = 1.56 to 5.31) but a lower rate after supplementation was discontinued (HR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.16 to 1.03). Similarly, the rate of having a recurrence or second primary cancer was higher during (HR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.27 to 2.72) but lower after (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.33 to 1.53) supplementation with alpha-tocopherol. The proportion of participants free of second primary cancer overall after 8 years of follow-up was similar in both arms.",alpha-Tocopherol supplementation produced unexpected adverse effects on the occurrence of second primary cancers and on cancer-free survival.
1046,15381891,To pilot and test the feasibility of a novel technology to reduce anxiety and pain associated with an invasive medical procedure in children with cancer.,"Children with cancer (ages 7-19) whose treatment protocols required access of their subcutaneous venous port device (port access) were randomly assigned to a virtual reality distraction intervention, a non-virtual reality distraction, or treatment as usual without a distraction. The researchers obtained assessments of the child's pain and anxiety from the parent, child, and unblinded nurses. Pulse rate was monitored throughout the procedure, and behavioral indices of distress were recorded, as observed by the researchers.",Reductions in pain and anxiety were found for children who used the virtual reality distraction in comparison with the no distraction condition as evidenced by lower pulse rate and reports of pain by nurses. No significant differences were found for the non-virtual reality condition versus the no distraction condition on pulse rate.,"These findings suggest that virtual reality may be a useful tool for distraction during painful medical procedures, but further studies are needed to test potential efficacy and feasibility during other, more distressing medical procedures with larger sample sizes."
1047,17156590,"Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is frequently reported by cancer patients receiving cytotoxic drugs. The specific mechanism of CRF in cancer patients is not completely known. In recent years, convincing evidence supports the management of fatigue with physical exercise. This study investigated a recommendation that physical activity, eg, a 30-minute daily walk, would decrease fatigue in cancer patients receiving cytotoxic drugs at an outpatient ward.","In total, 89 patients were interviewed about their fatigue and were asked to complete a questionnaire, the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), once a week over several treatment cycles of cytotoxic drugs. On inclusion, all patients received similar information about fatigue. After randomization, information about the positive effects of exercise was given to half of the patients after one cycle of cytotoxic drugs, and to the remaining patients after two cycles of cytotoxic drugs.","A total of 74 patients completed the study and returned useable questionnaires. The fatigue prevalence was 89% after one cytotoxic drug cycle. According to the FSI ratings, the group who received information about physical exercise after one cycle scored significantly lower ratings than the other group throughout the study (P = 0.034). The patient interviews confirmed that physical activity helped them to better battle fatigue. Intensity of other symptoms and side effects from cytotoxic drugs closely paralleled the fatigue ratings.","Fatigue was commonly found in the study population. Though small improvements followed physical exercise, results pointed towards the fact that information and exercise may support patients to combat fatigue. Early and frequent information would probably support patients to better combat fatigue by physical exercise."
1048,18471323,Data exist that demonstrate isoflavones' potent antiproliferative effects on prostate cancer cells. We evaluated the efficacy of isoflavone in patients with PSA recurrent prostate cancer after prior therapy. We postulated that isoflavone therapy would slow the rate of rise of serum PSA.,"Twenty patients with rising PSA after prior local therapy were enrolled in this open-labeled, Phase II, nonrandomized trial (Trial registration # NCT00596895). Patients were treated with soy milk containing 47 mg of isoflavonoid per 8 oz serving three times per day for 12 months. Serum PSA, testosterone, lipids, isoflavone levels (genistein, daidzein, and equol), and quality of life (QOL) were measured at various time points from 0 to 12 months. PSA outcome was evaluated.","Within the mixed regression model, it was estimated that PSA had increased 56% per year before study entry and only increased 20% per year for the 12-month study period (p = 0.05). Specifically, the slope of PSA after study entry was significantly lower than that before study entry in 6 patients and the slope of PSA after study entry was significantly higher than before study entry in 2 patients. For the remaining 12 patients, the change in slope was statistically insignificant. Nearly two thirds of the patients were noted to have significant levels of free equol in their serum while on therapy.","Dietary intervention with isoflavone supplementation may have biologic activity in men with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer as shown by a decline in the slope of PSA. This study may lend support to the literature that nutritional supplements have biologic activity in prostate cancer and therefore, further studies with these agents in randomized clinical trials should be encouraged."

All assessments including weight, body composition, C-reactive protein (CRP), QOL, dietary intake, PPL and cytokine analyses were performed at baseline, 3 and 9 weeks.","Twenty-three patients were enrolled, 20 completed 3 weeks, and 15 completed 9 weeks. The mean EPA-ONS intake was 1.7 tetrapaks (408 ml) daily. There was a significant increase in mean weight (2.5 kg) at 3 weeks (p=0.03). Lean body mass (LBM) was maintained. Protein and energy intake significantly decreased after the commencement of chemotherapy (protein p=0.003, energy p=0.02). There was a significant increase in energy levels (p=0.03), whilst all other QOL measures were maintained. PPL EPA levels increased significantly over the first 3 weeks. Mean CRP increased by 14.9 mg/L over the first 3 weeks (p=0.004), but decreased to baseline levels by the end of the trial. There was a significant correlation between plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations and survival, and between IL-12 and toxicity.","Dietary counseling and the provision of EPA-ONS may result in maintenance of nutritional status and QOL, however randomized trials are required to evaluate the impact of EPA on toxicity from chemotherapy."
1050,18327581,"A period of tumor growth precedes the clinical detection of breast cancer recurrence. We explore immune, endocrine, and behavioral parameters during this period.","We conducted a phase III clinical trial in which women with surgically treated stage II/III breast cancer (N = 227) were randomized to receive a psychological intervention or assessment-only and then regularly assessed for 10 years. Patients who recurred (R, n = 48) were matched with patients remaining disease-free (DF, n = 48) on demographic and prognostic characteristics, treatment, and duration of disease-free follow-up. Data at three assessment points, occurring, on average, 17, 11, and 4 months before the recurrence was detected clinically, with equivalent time points for the disease-free group, were examined. Mixed-effects models tested for group differences in immune cell counts and function as well as endocrine and behavioral parameters.","In the 17 months prior to recurrence detection, patients exhibited higher white blood cell count, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and natural killer cell counts, relative to DF patients. R patients also showed higher cortisol, worse physical functioning, fatigue, and quality of life. Follow-up analyses showed patients with local recurrences to differ from those with distant recurrence, with the former exhibiting elevated natural killer cell cytotoxicity, lymphocyte proliferative response, fatigue, pain, and emotional distress (depression, anxiety), and the latter exhibiting higher neutrophil, lymphocyte, and natural killer cell counts.",Patients who would recur showed reliable biobehavioral alterations more than a year prior to their diagnosis. This novel observation may contribute to our understanding of the disease relapse processes.

A hypothesized mechanism for exercise-induced colon cancer risk reduction might be through alterations in colon crypt cell architecture and proliferation.,"Healthy, sedentary participants with a colonoscopy within the previous 3 years were recruited through gastroenterology practices and media. We randomly assigned 100 women and 102 men, ages 40 to 75 years, to a control group or a 12-month exercise intervention of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise, 60 minutes per day, 6 days per week, and assessed change in number and relative position of Ki67-stained cells in colon mucosal crypts.","Exercisers did a mean 370 min/wk (men) and 295 min/wk (women) of exercise (seven dropped the intervention). In men, the mean height of Ki67-positive nuclei relative to total crypt height was related to amount of exercise, with changes from baseline of 0.0% (controls), +0.3% (exercisers &lt;250 min/wk), -1.7% (exercisers 250-300 min/wk), and -2.4% (exercisers &gt;300 min/wk; P(trend) = 0.03).

Similar trends were observed in other proliferation markers. In women, increased amount of exercise or V(O(2))max did not result in notable changes in proliferation markers.",A 12-month moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic exercise intervention resulted in significant decreases in colon crypt cell proliferation indices in men who exercised a mean of &gt;/=250 min/wk or whose V(O(2))max increased by &gt;/=5%.
1052,11250997,To investigate the effects of the Interactive Breast Cancer CDROM as a decision aid for breast cancer patients with a choice between breast conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy (MT).,"Consecutive patients with stage I and II breast cancer were enrolled. A quasi-experimental, longitudinal, and pretest/posttest design was used. Follow-up was scheduled 3 and 9 months after discharge from the hospital. Control patients (n = 88) received standard care (oral information and brochures). The CDROM was provided to patients in the experimental condition (n = 92) as a supplement to standard procedures. Outcome variables were treatment decision, satisfaction, and quality of life (QoL).","No effect on treatment decision was found. CDROM patients expressed more general satisfaction with information at 3 and 9 months (95% confidence interval for the difference (d) between the means (d: 4.1 to 12.5 and 5.7 to 14.2 respectively). CDROM patients were also more satisfied with their treatment decision at 3 and at 9 months (d: 0.1 to 0.4; 0.2 to 0.5). Moreover, at 9 months, CDROM patients were more satisfied with breast cancer-specific information (d: 0.9 to 16.5), the decision-making process (d: 0.1 to 0.4), and communication (d: 0.2 to 11.0). At 3 and 9 months, a positive effect was found on general health (d: 0.2 to 14.5 and 0.3 to 15.0). Moreover, at 9 months, CDROM patients reported better physical functioning (d: 5.1 to 19.8), less pain (d: -17.9 to -4.5), and fewer arm symptoms (d: -14.1 to -0.5).","The Interactive Breast Cancer CDROM improved decision making in patients with early-stage breast cancer with a choice between BCT and MT, as evaluated in terms of patients' satisfaction and QoL."
1053,22421908,"Lifestyle modification (i.e., regular physical activity and diet) is effective in preventing the age-related increase in cardiovascular disease risks. Potential therapeutic effects of curcumin (diferuloylmethane) have been confirmed on various diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, but the effects of curcumin have not been tested on central arterial hemodynamics. The aim of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that the regular endurance exercise combined with daily curcumin ingestion lowers the age-related increase in left ventricular (LV) afterload to a greater extent than monotherapy with either intervention alone in postmenopausal women using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel manner.","Forty-five women were randomly assigned to four interventions: &quot;placebo ingestion&quot; (n = 11), &quot;curcumin ingestion&quot; (n = 11), &quot;exercise training with placebo ingestion&quot; (n = 11), or &quot;exercise training with curcumin ingestion&quot; (n = 12). Curcumin or placebo pills (150 mg/day) were administered for 8 weeks. Aortic blood pressure (BP) and augmentation index (AIx), an index of LV afterload, were evaluated by pulse wave analysis from tonometrically measured radial arterial pressure waveforms.","There were no significant differences in baseline hemodynamic variables among four groups. After the interventions, brachial systolic BP (SBP) significantly decreased in both exercise-trained groups (P &lt; 0.05 for both), whereas aortic SBP significantly decreased only in the combined-treatment (e.g., exercise and curcumin) group (P &lt; 0.05). Heart rate (HR) corrected aortic AIx significantly decreases only in the combined-treatment group.",These findings suggest that regular endurance exercise combined with daily curcumin ingestion may reduce LV afterload to a greater extent than monotherapy with either intervention alone in postmenopausal women.

At Day 56, the MT group had a significantly lower AST (P = .05) and a trend toward a significantly lower ALT (P = .07). Although not significantly different, chemotherapy doses were reduced in 61% of the MT group compared with 72% of the placebo group. In vitro experiments revealed no antagonistic interactions between MT and vincristine or L-asparaginase in CCRF-CEM cells. A modest synergistic effect with vincristine was observed.","In children with ALL and liver toxicity, MT was associated with a trend toward significant reductions in liver toxicity. MT did not antagonize the effects of chemotherapy agents used for the treatment of ALL. Future study is needed to determine the most effective dose and duration of MT and its effect on hepatotoxicity and leukemia-free survival."
1056,29304734,"Improving participation rates in epidemiologic studies using questionnaires and biological sampling is important for the generalizability of the outcome. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of pre-notification, invitation length, questionnaire length, and reminder on participation rate and to investigate whether some factors contributed to participants doing both the questionnaire and blood sampling as oppose to only one part.","Our study was embedded within the pilot testing of a large population-based study about prostate cancer screening. Our study sample consisted of 28.134 men between 50 and 69\u00a0years of age and living in the region of Stockholm (Sweden) invited to respond to a web-based questionnaire and to provide blood for prostate cancer testing. The men were randomly allocated according to birth of date to receive either: (a) a pre-notification postcard or not; (b) a shorter or a longer invitation letter; (c) a shorter or a longer web-based questionnaire, and (d) a reminder or not. The effects of the survey design factors were tested using chi-square.","The use of a pre-notification (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001), a longer questionnaire (p\u2009=\u20090.004) and the use of a reminder (p\u2009=\u20090.02) were associated with an increase in overall participation, i.e. responding to the questionnaire or providing blood for PCT or performing both components.","The results of this pilot study justified the use of\u00a0a pre-notification and a reminder in the following large population based study since the benefits of increased participation traded off against the greater costs incurred. Furthermore, we were able to use the longer version of the questionnaire, which allowed us to collect more information without risking a lower response rate."
1057,23690410,"Colorectal cancer survivors are at risk for poor health outcomes because of unhealthy lifestyles, but few studies have developed translatable health behavior change interventions. This study aimed to determine the effects of a telephone-delivered multiple health behavior change intervention (CanChange) on health and behavioral outcomes among colorectal cancer survivors.","In this two-group randomized controlled trial, 410 colorectal cancer survivors were randomly assigned to the health coaching intervention (11 theory-based telephone-delivered health coaching sessions delivered over 6 months focusing on physical activity, weight management, dietary habits, alcohol, and smoking) or usual care. Assessment of primary (ie, physical activity [Godin Leisure Time Index], health-related quality of life [HRQoL; Short Form-36], and cancer-related fatigue [Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale]) and secondary outcomes (ie, body mass index [kg/m(2)], diet and alcohol intake [Food Frequency Questionnaire], and smoking) were conducted at baseline and 6 and 12 months.","At 12 months, significant intervention effects were observed for moderate physical activity (28.5 minutes; P = .003), body mass index (-0.9 kg/m(2); P = .001), energy from total fat (-7.0%; P = .006), and energy from saturated fat (-2.8%; P = .016). A significant intervention effect was reported for vegetable intake (0.4 servings per day; P = .001) at 6 months. No significant group differences were found at 6 or 12 months for HRQoL, cancer-related fatigue, fruit, fiber, or alcohol intake, or smoking.","The CanChange intervention was effective for improving physical activity, dietary habits, and body mass index in colorectal cancer survivors. The intervention is translatable through existing telephone cancer support and information services in Australia and other countries."
1058,30540842,"Recently, the clinical importance of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and its protective role against several chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and several types of cancers has been reported. However, its association with cardio-metabolic risk factors among patients candidate for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has not been evaluated yet. CABG is associated with increased oxidative stress and free radicals; so, the current study was aimed to evaluate the potential association of TAC with cardiovascular risk factors among patients candidate for CABG.","In the current cross-sectional study, 454 patients aged 35-80 years as candidates of CABG and hospitalized in Tehran Heart Center were enrolled. Anthropometric and demographic characteristics were obtained from all participants. Total dietary antioxidant capacity (TAC) was calculated according to the findings of semi-quantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Biochemical parameters including serum lipids, albumin, creatinine, HbA1C, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipoprotein (a), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum vitamin D concentrations were also assessed by commercial laboratory methods.","Male patients in the top quintiles of TAC had significantly lower prevalence of hypertension (35.1% vs 45.9%). Moreover, male patients at fifth quintile of TAC were 2% more serum vitamin D concentrations, 3% lower serum cholesterol concentrations compared with lowest quintile. Top quintiles of TAC make patients more likely to have low hematocrit and high serum albumin concentrations compared with lowest quintiles (P &lt; 0.05). However, in female participants, only serum creatinine concentration was in negative association with TAC. In comparison of clinical parameters, females in the fifth quintile of TAC had 9% higher EF compared with patients in the first quintile (P = 0.021).","To our findings, higher dietary antioxidant capacity was associated with lower prevalence of hypertension, lower hematocrit, total cholesterol and higher albumin and vitamin D concentrations. Therefore, high dietary TAC could be considered as a potent protective tool against cardio-metabolic risk factors in patients CABG candidate for especially in male patients."
1059,17575560,"Psychological morbidity in cancer patients is common, but often undetected and untreated. We developed a communication skills training (CST) program targeting this issue, and evaluated its impact on doctor behaviour.","Thirty of 35 oncologists from six teaching hospitals in six Australian cities, participated. The CST was a 1.5-day intensive face-to-face workshop incorporating presentation of principles, a DVD modelling ideal behaviour and role-play practice, followed by four 1.5 h monthly video-conferences incorporating role-play of doctor-generated scenarios. Doctors were randomized to receive the CST or not. Simulated patient interviews were videotaped and coded at baseline, after CST and 6 months later. Doctors completed questionnaires assessing stress and burnout at the same time points.","Doctors in the intervention group displayed more creating environment and fewer blocking behaviours at both follow-ups; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Intervention doctors valued the training highly, but did not report substantial reductions in stress and burnout.",This short training programme demonstrated a positive effect on aspects of doctor behaviour. Video-conferencing after a short training course may be an effective strategy for delivering CST.
1060,28733130,The diagnosis of breast cancer in young women (aged 18-45 years) has been increasing. Women are commonly left coping with treatment-related disabilities of the upper limb that can persist for &gt; 2 years postoperatively.,"A total of 59 young breast cancer patients (29 in the intervention group and 30 in the control group) participated in a pilot prospective randomized controlled trial to determine whether a 12-week postradiation exercise program would improve long-term arm mobility, pain, and handgrip strength. During an 18-month period, range of motion, handgrip strength, and pain with shoulder movements were evaluated at 6 points.","Although the differences were not statistically significant, external rotation and horizontal abduction of the shoulder improved in the intervention group immediately after the exercise intervention (3 months) and showed a trend toward less pain on movement. However, at 18 months after radiation the control and intervention groups both retained a residual loss of range and persistent pain with movement. Radiation to the axilla and/or chest wall yielded long-term (18 months) limitations in flexion and horizontal abduction compared with hypofractionation, which resulted in greater flexion and external rotation at 18 months. The median grip strength of the study participants corresponded to the 10th percentile of healthy aged-matched white women.","The exercise intervention timed shortly after radiation improved short-term shoulder mobility and pain; however, these gains were not sustained at 18 months after radiation."
1061,19940781,"Anxious patients can cause unexpected increases in healthcare costs that are often overlooked. There are no studies examining the use of an educational pamphlet and its effects on secondary outcomes at colonoscopy. The goal of this study was to determine if the use of an educational pamphlet lowers the anxiety levels before colonoscopy, and if its use has any effect on the quality of the prep or medication or the amount of medication use during the procedure.","We prospectively enrolled 121 patients having a first-time screening colonoscopy. Patients were blinded and randomized into two groups. One group received standard prep instructions only (group P), and the other group received the American Gastroenterological Association colonoscopy educational pamphlet along with their prep instructions (group I). All information was sent by mail 3 weeks before the procedure. The endoscopists were blinded as to which of their patients were in the study and of those, which were in the standard prep group or the intervention group. Anxiety was measured immediately before endoscopy using the State portion of the 'State Trait Anxiety Index'. Procedure-related information was recorded and analyzed at the end of the study using a statistical package looking at primary and secondary endpoints.","Fifteen patients did not show their examination or were otherwise lost to follow-up. Of the 106 patients who completed the study, there were 55 patients in the P group and 51 in the I group. The average State Anxiety score of the P group was 45.18, and of the I group was 40.54 (P=0.014). The use of Midazolam was significantly less in the group. The use of Meperidine was lower in the I group but the difference was not statistically significant. Both the groups took the same amount of time to complete the prep, but the I group fasted longer. The I group also completed or drank more of the prep more often than the P group. The prep quality was found to be superior with less frequency of a poor prep in the I group. Most important, the I group was more likely to have a complete colonoscopy. The I group tended to have fewer questions on the day of the procedure, and less fear about what to expect on the basis of their lower anxiety scores.","We found that providing the American Gastroenterological Association educational pamphlet to patients before colonoscopy lowers the overall anxiety level, provides a reduction in sedative use during the procedure, and leads to better colon preparation when given in addition to standard instructions."
1062,11983755,North American Chinese women have lower levels of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing than other population subgroups. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of two alternative cervical cancer screening interventions for Chinese women living in North America.,"Four hundred and eighty-two Pap testing underutilizers were identified from community-based surveys of Chinese women conducted in Seattle, Washington, and Vancouver, British Columbia. These women were randomly assigned to one of two experimental arms or control status. Several Chinese-language materials were used in both experimental arms: an education-entertainment video, a motivational pamphlet, an educational brochure, and a fact sheet. Women in the first experimental group (outreach worker intervention) received the materials, as well as tailored counseling and logistic assistance, during home visits by trilingual, bicultural outreach workers. Those in the second experimental group (direct mail intervention) received the materials by mail. The control group received usual care. Follow-up surveys were completed 6 months after randomization to ascertain participants' Pap testing behavior. All statistical tests were two-sided.","A total of 402 women responded to the follow-up survey (83% response rate). Of these women, 50 (39%) of the 129 women in the outreach group, 35 (25%) of the 139 women in the direct mail group, and 20 (15%) of the 134 women in the control group reported Pap testing in the interval between randomization and follow-up data collection (P&lt;.001 for outreach worker versus control, P =.03 for direct mail versus control, and P =.02 for outreach worker versus direct mail). Intervention effects were greater in Vancouver than in Seattle.",Culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions may improve Pap testing levels among Chinese women in North America.

The excluded or dropping off cases were 10 in CM, 6 in ITWM and 14 in WM. Clinical trials were conducted in 6 hospitals and 3 months of treatment was taken as one therapeutic course. The main observation indexes were tumor size, Karnofsky scores, body weight, adverse reaction, etc.","The total effective rate of tumor remission in the 3 groups was 4.0%, 26.2%, and 14.1%, respectively, statistical significance was shown in the difference among them (chi = 21.72, P = 0.000 &lt; 0.017). The total tumor stabilization rate was 66.7 , 81.6%, and 76.1 , respectively, by rectification test, no significance was shown in difference among them (chi2 = 6.052, P = 0.049 &gt; 0.017). Karnofsky scoring showed that after 90 days of treatment, Karnofsky score raised in the CM and ITWM group, but lowered in the WM group, paired t-test showed significant difference in the ITWM group before and after treatment. The Karnofsky score in IWTM was higher than that in CM and WM with significant difference (H = 10.572, P = 0.000 &lt; 0.05). The patients' body weight in the 3 groups were all reduced. The reduction in the CM and ITWM group was lower than that in WM group, among which, significant difference was shown in CM and WM group when compared with the same group before treatment (P &lt; 0.05). The effect in the ITWM and CM group was better than that in WM group in aspects of improving such tumor related symptoms as cough, short breath, anorexia, fatigue, etc. Observation of adverse reaction showed that lesser hemotoxicity of III and IV grade appeared in the CM and ITWM group than that in the WM group, and significant difference was shown in counts of white blood cells, granulocytes, platelets hemoglobin, etc. among the 3 groups (P &lt; 0.01).","ITWM therapy showed better short-term efficacy in treating patients with NSCLC than CM or WM alone, showing the superiority of ITWM therapy. It can be adopted as an effective therapeutic program with low-toxicity."
1064,10675166,Urinary incontinence is a common long-term complication after radical prostatectomy. Spontaneous recovery of normal urinary control after surgery can take 1-2 years. We aimed to investigate whether there was any beneficial effect of pelvic-floor re-education for patients with urinary incontinence as a result of radical prostatectomy.,"102 consecutive incontinent patients who had had radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer and who could comply with the ambulatory treatment schedule in our hospital were randomised, after catheter removal, into a treatment group (n=50) and a control group (n=52). Patients in the treatment group took part in a pelvic-floor re-education programme for as long as they were incontinent, and for a maximum of 1 year. The control group received placebo therapy. The primary endpoint was continence rate at 3 months. Incontinence was assessed objectively with the 1 h and 24 h pad tests and subjectively by the visual analogue scale. The groups were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis by ANOVA and chi2-test.","In the treatment group continence was achieved after 3 months in 43 (88%) of 48 patients. In the control group, continence returned after 3 months in 29 (56%) of 52 patients. At 1 year, the difference in proportion between treatment and control group was 14% (95% CI 2-27). In the treatment group improvement in both duration (log-rank test, p=0.0001) and degree of incontinence (Wald test, p=0.0010) was significantly better than in the control group.",Pelvic-floor re-education should be considered as a first-line option in curing incontinence after radical prostatectomy.

1068,20555256,There is increasing recognition of mindfulness and mindfulness training as a way to decrease stress and increase psychological functioning.The aim of this study was to examine the perceived effects and experiences of mindfulness stress-reduction training as described by patients with cancer participating in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction training program.,The study is based on analysis of data collected in semistructured interviews of the participants (n = 18) after the completion of a mindfulness-meditation training program. The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness-training course.,"Most participants expressed a number of perceived positive effects of participating in the mindfulness program including increased calm, enhanced sleep quality, more energy, less physical pain, and increased well-being. However, a few participants experienced no effect. Both negative and positive views of the specific meditation and yoga exercises included in the program were expressed. Components that were described as of particular importance, regarding the experience of participating in the program, were the nonjudgmental and accepting approach guiding the program and the instructors, the influence of the group process and sharing experiences with patients with similar experiences, and the emphasis on increased awareness of the present moment.",This study gives support for the use of mindfulness programs in reducing stress-related complaints among some patients with a cancer diagnosis.The positive experiences of mindfulness training reported by patients with cancer call for further studies examining the possibilities and requirements for implementation of mindfulness programs in clinical practice.
1069,17109580,The aim of this study was to determine whether equol excretion status and plasma hormone and leptin concentrations can be influenced by consumption of a probiotic supplement. A secondary focus was to investigate whether male equol excretors have a hormone profile consistent with reduced prostate cancer risk.,"The design was a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial.Thirty-one (31) of the initially enrolled 39 subjects, 18 to 37 years old, completed all study requirements.Subjects consumed either probiotic capsules (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum) or placebo capsules for 2 months. Fasting plasma concentrations of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstanediol glucuronide (AAG), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and leptin were measured on days 1 and 57. Urinary excretion of genistein, glycitein, daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-Dma), and equol was measured on days 4 and 61 following a 4-day soy challenge.","Probiotic consumption did not significantly alter equol excretor status, plasma hormone, or leptin concentrations in these subjects. At baseline, there were no differences in plasma hormone concentrations between equol excretors and nonexcretors; however, the low number of equol excretors included in this study limits the strength of this finding.","The 2-month intervention with probiotic capsules did not significantly alter equol excretion, plasma hormone, or leptin concentrations in these subjects. A secondary finding was that male equol excretors in this study did not exhibit a hormone profile consistent with reduced prostate cancer risk, although this result should be interpreted with caution."

Patients were randomly assigned to one of the three information conditions stratified by age group.,"Patients were more satisfied with the comprehensibility, attractiveness, and the emotional support from the website when information was presented as text with personalized video compared to text only. Text with personalized video also outperformed text with nonpersonalized video regarding emotional support from the website. Furthermore, text with video improved patients' recall of cancer-related information as compared to text only. Older patients recalled less information correctly than younger patients, except when we controlled for Internet use.",Text with personalized audiovisual information can enhance website satisfaction and information recall. Internet use plays an important role in explaining recall of information.The results of this study can be used to develop effective health communication materials for cancer patients.
1071,30247967,To assess whether a self-care toolkit (SCT) provided to breast cancer patients undergoing surgery could mitigate distress and lessen symptoms associated with surgery.,"One hundred women with breast cancer, planning to undergo initial surgery, were randomly assigned to either one of two groups: treatment as usual (TAU; n\u2009=\u200949) or TAU with the addition of an SCT (n\u2009=\u200951). The SCT contained an MP3 player with audio-files of guided mind-body techniques (breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, guided imagery, and self-hypnosis) and acupressure antinausea wristbands. Anxiety, pain, nausea, sleep, fatigue, global health, and quality of life (QOL) were assessed using validated outcome measures. Two inflammatory blood markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were measured serially. Data were collected at baseline (T1), immediately before surgery (T2), within 10\u2009h postoperatively (T3), and \u223c2 weeks postsurgery (T4).Numerous studies have shown that psychological distress associated with a cancer diagnosis can affect pain perception and QOL.","Between T1 and T4, there were significant between-group differences in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-57 scores of Pain Interference, Fatigue, and Satisfaction with Social Roles, favoring the SCT group compared with TAU (p\u2009=\u20090.005, p\u2009=\u20090.023, and p\u2009=\u20090.021, respectively). There was a significant mean change in Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) scores from T2 to T3, with the SCT group having significantly smaller increases in postoperative pain (p\u2009=\u20090.008) and in postoperative ESR (p\u2009=\u20090.0197) compared with the TAU group. Clinically significant reductions in anxiety occurred in the SCT group during the main intervention period.","These results suggest that using the SCT in the perioperative period decreased pain perceptions, fatigue, and inflammatory cytokine secretion."

Secondary aims included establishing appropriate questionnaire distribution and collection methods within the framework of the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme and optimisation of questionnaire design.,"Randomised study.Oxfordshire and West of London Breast Screening Units.6400 women invited for routine screening mammography were individually randomised to receive either the usual breast screening invitation alone, or to receive the usual invitation accompanied by a self administered questionnaire, to be returned at the time of screening. Participants were then followed up and attendance rates at screening were compared between groups.","Screening attendance rates were similar in women who did and did not receive a questionnaire (71% in each group). Of those who were sent a questionnaire and attended for screening, 77% returned a completed questionnaire. Screening uptake was not affected by the way in which the questionnaire was returned or by whether or not personal details and signed permission for follow up were requested.",The inclusion of a self administered questionnaire accompanying the invitation to breast screening did not adversely affect screening uptake. A high proportion of women completed the questionnaire.

Personalised booklets were more likely than general booklets to tell patients something new. There was no difference in patients' perceived understanding of their cancer by any of the intervention factors. Patients with personalised information were more likely to show their booklets to others and to think it helped in discussing their cancer or its treatment.

1075,17635889,"Evidence is lacking that a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in total fat can influence breast cancer recurrence or survival.To assess whether a major increase in vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake and a decrease in dietary fat intake reduces the risk of recurrent and new primary breast cancer and all-cause mortality among women with previously treated early stage breast cancer.","Multi-institutional randomized controlled trial of dietary change in 3088 women previously treated for early stage breast cancer who were 18 to 70 years old at diagnosis. Women were enrolled between 1995 and 2000 and followed up through June 1, 2006.The intervention group (n = 1537) was randomly assigned to receive a telephone counseling program supplemented with cooking classes and newsletters that promoted daily targets of 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice; 3 fruit servings; 30 g of fiber; and 15% to 20% of energy intake from fat. The comparison group (n = 1551) was provided with print materials describing the &quot;5-A-Day&quot; dietary guidelines.Invasive breast cancer event (recurrence or new primary) or death from any cause.","From comparable dietary patterns at baseline, a conservative imputation analysis showed that the intervention group achieved and maintained the following statistically significant differences vs the comparison group through 4 years: servings of vegetables, +65%; fruit, +25%; fiber, +30%, and energy intake from fat, -13%. Plasma carotenoid concentrations validated changes in fruit and vegetable intake. Throughout the study, women in both groups received similar clinical care. Over the mean 7.3-year follow-up, 256 women in the intervention group (16.7%) vs 262 in the comparison group (16.9%) experienced an invasive breast cancer event (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.14; P = .63), and 155 intervention group women (10.1%) vs 160 comparison group women (10.3%) died (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15; P = .43). No significant interactions were observed between diet group and baseline demographics, characteristics of the original tumor, baseline dietary pattern, or breast cancer treatment.","Among survivors of early stage breast cancer, adoption of a diet that was very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat did not reduce additional breast cancer events or mortality during a 7.3-year follow-up period."
1076,30027756,"Bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN) is a common and debilitating side effect. Our pilot study demonstrated that acupuncture is safe and can decrease total neuropathic symptoms. However, there is lack of knowledge in which individual BIPN symptoms benefited from acupuncture.To characterize individual symptoms reduced by acupuncture in patients with BIPN.","Patients with multiple myeloma treated with bortezomib who developed BIPN grade 2 or above, based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), were enrolled and received 10 acupuncture treatments over 10 weeks. Self-reported BIPN-associated symptoms assessments were collected weekly at baseline, during, and after acupuncture treatment using the Neuropathy Pain Scale (NPS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx) questionnaires. Changes in individual symptoms were analyzed based on FACT/GOG-Ntx and NPS scores.","There were statistically significant reductions in individual symptoms in both NPS and FACT/GOG-Ntx. The FACT/GOG-Ntx reductions were most pronounced in hand/feet numbness/tingling, discomfort, and trouble walking. The sensory symptoms, such as tingling and numbness, especially in the feet, reduced the most ( P &lt; .0001), and motor dysfunction also reduced significantly ( P = .0001). Both hearing and dysfunction scores were also statistically significantly increased, indicating improved symptoms. The NPS scores showed significant symptom relief in all 10 items from the NPS assessment, particularly in cold sensitivity and an unpleasant feeling.","Acupuncture can improve multiple symptoms associated with BIPN, particularly numbness and tingling in hands and feet, cold sensitivity, and an unpleasant feeling. Further randomized control trials are warranted to confirm our findings."

The benefit persisted when analyzed by age; race, and prior screening behavior. This intervention was practice based, not dependent on visits, and enhanced the efficacy of an already successful computerized preventive care information system.","Personalized education and case management are successful in enhancing compliance with breast cancer screening among historically noncompliant vulnerable urban women. This intervention, when combined with a preventive care information system, has the potential to achieve Healthy People 2000 objectives for breast cancer screening."
1078,9597024,"We examined the relationship between intakes of specific foods--namely, meats, vegetables, and fruits--with levels of oxidative DNA damage in women consuming their own usual diet or a diet low in fat.","Blood was obtained from women who had been assigned randomly to a low-fat or nonintervention diet for 3 to 24 months. Levels of 5-hydroxymethyluracil, a type of oxidative DNA damage, were determined. Diet data were obtained from 3-day food records.The 21 women were participating in an outpatient clinic. All the women were healthy but had a first-degree relative with breast cancer.The intervention was a self-selected diet with a goal of 15% of energy from fat.Existing data on oxidative DNA damage levels were evaluated for possible relationships to foods eaten. Intakes of raw and cooked vegetables were examined separately. Meat intake was examined by type of meat (pork, beef, fish, chicken) and by cooking temperature.Initial univariate analyses relied on Spearman rank correlations of each food item with DNA damage. Further analyses of the data were performed with univariate and multivariate weighted least squares regression models.",The model that best explained DNA damage levels was a bivariate regression model that included the intake of cooked vegetables and the sum of beef and pork intake. This model accounted for 85% of the variation in DNA damage levels among women. Preliminary results are suggestive of a positive association of DNA damage with beef and pork intake and a negative association with cooked vegetable intake.,"These observations, if confirmed in larger studies, suggest specific dietary changes to reduce oxidative DNA damage levels and possibly cancer risk."

1080,24036846,"Gastric upset is a common side effect of nilotinib therapy, and calcium carbonate is frequently used concomitantly, either as antacid or as calcium supplementation. With the increasing number of oral agents in cancer therapy, oral drug-drug interactions are becoming more relevant. Nilotinib has already been shown to be absorbed to a much lesser extent when co-administered with proton pump inhibitors. Because exposure to sub-therapeutic concentrations of anticancer drugs such as nilotinib may result in selection of resistant clones and ultimately relapse, we studied the effect of a calcium carbonate supplement (Tums Ultra 1000\u00ae) on nilotinib pharmacokinetics.Nilotinib is a second-generation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with superior efficacy compared with imatinib mesylate in the treatment for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Calcium carbonate is commonly used as a source of calcium supplementation or as antacid to ameliorate the gastrointestinal side effects associated with nilotinib, which could have unknown effects on nilotinib absorption. The purpose of this study was to provide information on the effect of calcium carbonate on the PK of nilotinib in healthy volunteers.","Healthy subjects were enrolled in a two-period, open-label, single-institution, randomized, cross-over, fixed-schedule study. In one period, each subject received 400 mg of nilotinib p.o. In the other period, 4,000 mg of calcium carbonate (4 X Tums Ultra 1000\u00ae) was administered p.o. 15 min prior to the nilotinib dose. Plasma samples were collected at specified timepoints, concentrations of nilotinib were quantitated by LC-MS, and data were analyzed non-compartmentally.","Eleven subjects were evaluable. Calcium supplementation did not significantly affect nilotinib pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (18.4 \u03bcg/mL h alone vs. 16.9 \u03bcg/mL h with calcium carbonate, p = 0.83; 80 % power); maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) (0.670 \u03bcg/mL alone vs. 6.18 \u03bcg/mL with calcium carbonate, p = 0.97); or half-life (18.9 h alone vs. 17.2 h with calcium carbonate, p = 0.18).",Calcium carbonate may be co-administered with nilotinib without significantly affecting the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib and potentially impacting efficacy.Our results indicate that the use of calcium carbonate does not significantly affect nilotinib pharmacokinetics.
1081,27810949,To assess whether exposing drinkers to information about the alcohol-cancer link via multiple and diverse sources in an online simulation produces larger improvements in attitudes and intentions relative to exposure to a single source of information.,"Experimental; unequal randomization with respondents allocated to either the single-source (20%) or multiple-source condition (80%). Alcohol-related behavioral intentions were assessed preexposure and postexposure.Australia.A total of 2087 drinkers consuming alcohol at least twice per month.Scales were used to assess attitudes toward the messages (believability, convincingness, and personal relevance) and behavioral intentions (extent to which participants believed that they should and would reduce their alcohol consumption and their intention to consume 5 or more drinks in a single session).Hierarchical linear regression.","Source condition was significantly associated with all 3 attitudinal variables ( P &lt; .001). Those exposed to an alcohol warning statement from multiple sources found the message more believable, convincing, and personally relevant compared to those exposed to a warning statement via a single source. They also reported significantly greater change preexposure to postexposure on the 2 behavioral beliefs that they should (\u0394 M = 0.25 vs \u0394 M = 0.09) and would (\u0394 M = 0.23 vs \u0394 M = 0.00) reduce their current alcohol consumption ( P &lt; .001). Further, those in the multiple-source condition reported reduced intentions to consume 5 or more standard drinks in a single sitting (\u0394 M = 0.21 vs \u0394 M = 0.14; P &lt; .001).","Findings from the online simulation provide support for the suggestion that integrated approaches involving the combination of multiple sources to deliver a message produce superior outcomes compared to relying on a single source (eg, warning labels on alcoholic beverages)."
1082,16685066,"In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that selected strains of probiotic bacteria can form tight complexes with aflatoxin B(1) and other carcinogens.The aim of the present study was to determine whether administration of probiotic bacteria could block the intestinal absorption of aflatoxin B(1) and thereby lead to reduced urinary excretion of aflatoxin B(1)-N(7)-guanine (AFB-N(7)-guanine), a marker for a biologically effective dose of aflatoxin exposure. Elevated urinary excretion of this aflatoxin-DNA adduct is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer.","Ninety healthy young men from Guangzhou, China, were randomly assigned to 2 groups; one group received a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LC705 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii strains 2 times/d for 5 wk, and the other group received a placebo preparation. The subjects provided 4 urine samples: at baseline, at 3 and 5 wk after starting the supplementation, and at the end of the 5-wk postintervention period.","The percentage of samples with negative AFB-N(7)-guanine values tended to be higher in the probiotic group than in the placebo group during the 5-wk intervention period (odds ratio: 2.63, P = 0.052), and a statistically significant decrease in the concentration of urinary AFB-N(7)-guanine was observed in the probiotic group. The reduction was 36% at week 3 and 55% at week 5. The geometric means for the probiotic and placebo groups were 0.24 and 0.49 ng AFB-N(7)-guanine/mL, respectively, during the intervention period (P = 0.005).",A probiotic supplement reduces the biologically effective dose of aflatoxin exposure and may thereby offer an effective dietary approach to decrease the risk of liver cancer.
1083,16676013,To determine which method of delivery of a cancer orientation program contributed to higher levels of satisfaction and lower levels of anxiety for newly diagnosed patients with cancer and each patient's support person.,"A randomized study of patients with cancer and caregivers into one of three delivery methods for an orientation program or a control arm.A National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in the midwestern United States.Newly registered patients with cancer diagnoses and their identified support people.The intervention consisted of an orientation video and booklet delivered by three separate methods: class, drop-in sessions, or information mailed to homes. Participants completed questionnaires before the intervention and three weeks after the intervention.State and trait anxiety, satisfaction, understanding of the organization, awareness and use of resources, and stress and coping.","The most successful accrual arms were the mailed intervention and control groups. The mailed intervention group compared to the control group reported higher levels of satisfaction with the cancer center, satisfaction with resources, understanding of the cancer center's structure, and satisfaction with healthcare professionals' communication with them. Fewer intervention group participants reported a lack of awareness of specific resources, and a larger percentage of the intervention group used available resources. Fewer benefits were noted with caregivers.",The mailed intervention was successful in improving several patient outcomes. It was shown to be especially helpful to those with high trait anxiety.A mailed orientation program can be a useful approach for increasing satisfaction with services.
1084,26720730,"Healthcare overuse, the delivery of low-value services, is increasingly recognized as a critical problem. However, little is known about the comparative effectiveness of alternate formats for presenting benefits and harms information to patients as a strategy to reduce overuse.To examine the effect of different benefits and harms presentations on patients' intentions to accept low-value or potentially low-value screening services (prostate cancer screening in men ages 50-69 years; osteoporosis screening in low-risk women ages 50-64 years; or colorectal cancer screening in men and women ages 76-85 years).","Randomized clinical trial of 775 individuals eligible to receive information about any 1 of the 3 screening services and scheduled for a visit with their clinician. Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 intervention arms that differed in terms of presentation format: words, numbers, numbers plus narrative, and numbers plus framed presentation.

The data were analyzed between May and September of 2015.One-page evidence-based decision support sheets on each of the 3 screening services, with benefits and harms information presented in 1 of 4 formats: words, numbers, numbers\u2009plus\u2009narratives, or numbers\u2009plus\u2009a framed presentation.The primary outcome was change in intention to accept screening (on a response scale from 1 to 5). Our secondary outcomes included general and disease-specific knowledge, perceived risk and consequences of disease, screening attitudes, perceived net benefit of screening, values clarity, and self-efficacy for screening.","We enrolled and randomly allocated 775 individuals, aged 50 to 85 years, to 1 of 4 intervention arms: 195 to words, 192 to numbers, 196 to narrative, and 192 to framed formats. Intentions to accept screening were high before the intervention and change in intentions did not differ across intervention arms (words, -0.07; numbers, -0.05; numbers plus narrative, -0.12; numbers plus framed presentation, -0.02; P = .57 for all comparisons). Change in other outcomes also showed no difference across intervention arms. Results were similar when stratified by screening service.","Single, brief, written decision support interventions, such as the ones in this study, are unlikely to be sufficient to change intentions for screening. Alternate and additional interventions are needed to reduce overused screening services."
1085,23796191,"There is clear evidence of the detrimental impact of hazardous alcohol consumption on the physical and mental health of the population. Estimates suggest that hazardous alcohol consumption annually accounts for 150,000 hospital admissions and between 15,000 and 22,000 deaths in the UK. In the older population, hazardous alcohol consumption is associated with a wide range of physical, psychological and social problems. There is evidence of an association between increased alcohol consumption and increased risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension and haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke, increased rates of alcohol-related liver disease and increased risk of a range of cancers. Alcohol is identified as one of the three main risk factors for falls. Excessive alcohol consumption in older age can also contribute to the onset of dementia and other age-related cognitive deficits and is implicated in one-third of all suicides in the older population.To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a stepped care intervention against a minimal intervention in the treatment of older hazardous alcohol users in primary care.This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 17, No. 25. See the HTA programme website for further project information.","A multicentre, pragmatic, two-armed randomised controlled trial with an economic evaluation.General practices in primary care in England and Scotland between April 2008 and October 2010.Adults aged \u2265 55 years scoring \u2265 8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (10-item) (AUDIT) were eligible. In total, 529 patients were randomised in the study.The minimal intervention group received a 5-minute brief advice intervention with the practice or research nurse involving feedback of the screening results and discussion regarding the health consequences of continued hazardous alcohol consumption. Those in the stepped care arm initially received a 20-minute session of behavioural change counselling, with referral to step 2 (motivational enhancement therapy) and step 3 (local specialist alcohol services) if indicated. Sessions were recorded and rated to ensure treatment fidelity.The primary outcome was average drinks per day (ADD) derived from extended AUDIT--Consumption (3-item) (AUDIT-C) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were AUDIT-C score at 6 and 12 months; alcohol-related problems assessed using the Drinking Problems Index (DPI) at 6 and 12 months; health-related quality of life assessed using the Short Form Questionnaire-12 items (SF-12) at 6 and 12 months; ADD at 6 months; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (for cost-utility analysis derived from European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions); and health and social care resource use associated with the two groups.","Both groups reduced alcohol consumption between baseline and 12 months. The difference between groups in log-transformed ADD at 12 months was very small, at 0.025 [95% confidence interval (CI)--0.060 to 0.119], and not statistically significant. At month 6 the stepped care group had a lower ADD, but again the difference was not statistically significant. At months 6 and 12, the stepped care group had a lower DPI score, but this difference was not statistically significant at the 5% level. The stepped care group had a lower SF-12 mental component score and lower physical component score at month 6 and month 12, but these differences were not statistically significant at the 5% level. The overall average cost per patient, taking into account health and social care resource use, was \u00a3488 [standard deviation (SD) \u00a3826] in the stepped care group and \u00a3482 (SD \u00a3826) in the minimal intervention group at month 6. The mean QALY gains were slightly greater in the stepped care group than in the minimal intervention group, with a mean difference of 0.0058 (95% CI -0.0018 to 0.0133), generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of \u00a31100 per QALY gained. At month 12, participants in the stepped care group incurred fewer costs, with a mean difference of -\u00a3194 (95% CI -\u00a3585 to \u00a3198), and had gained 0.0117 more QALYs (95% CI -0.0084 to 0.0318) than the control group. Therefore, from an economic perspective the minimal intervention was dominated by stepped care but, as would be expected given the effectiveness results, the difference was small and not statistically significant.",Stepped care does not confer an advantage over minimal intervention in terms of reduction in alcohol consumption at 12 months post intervention when compared with a 5-minute brief (minimal) intervention.

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare change in Symptom Distress Scale (SDS-15) scores from pre-treatment to end-of-study by groups in the matched sample.","Radiation oncology participants used the intervention, overall and voluntarily, more than medical oncology and transplant participants. Participants who were working and had more than a high school education voluntarily used the intervention more. The SDS-15 score was reduced by an estimated 1.53 points (P=.01) in the intervention group users compared to the matched control group.","The intended effects of a Web-based, patient-centered intervention on cancer symptom distress were modified by intervention use frequency. Clinical and personal demographics influenced voluntary use."

Application of this research will benefit from determining the most important interventions for promoting TSSE.Identification of the most important Check-It-Out intervention components for promoting TSSE.,This study analyzed the responses of the 567 participants who were randomized into the skin examination intervention group and who did not report performing TSSE at their baseline interview.,"Watching the video, using the hand mirror, shower card, American Cancer Society brochure, sample photographs, and finding the health educator helpful were associated with performing TSSE at 2 months, 12 months, or both.","Use of the materials within the skin group was not randomly assigned. All data were based on participant self-report.As future interventions to increase TSSE are developed, the identified useful components will be important to include."
1093,16391215,"Obesity in the United States has increased dramatically during the past several decades. There is debate about optimum calorie balance for prevention of weight gain, and proponents of some low-carbohydrate diet regimens have suggested that the increasing obesity may be attributed, in part, to low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets.To report data on body weight in a long-term, low-fat diet trial for which the primary end points were breast and colorectal cancer and to examine the relationships between weight changes and changes in dietary components.","Randomized intervention trial of 48,835 postmenopausal women in the United States who were of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities and participated in the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial; 40% (19,541) were randomized to the intervention and 60% (29,294) to a control group. Study enrollment was between 1993 and 1998, and this analysis includes a mean follow-up of 7.5 years (through August 31, 2004).The intervention included group and individual sessions to promote a decrease in fat intake and increases in vegetable, fruit, and grain consumption and did not include weight loss or caloric restriction goals. The control group received diet-related education materials.Change in body weight from baseline to follow-up.","Women in the intervention group lost weight in the first year (mean of 2.2 kg, P&lt;.001) and maintained lower weight than control women during an average 7.5 years of follow-up (difference, 1.9 kg, P&lt;.001 at 1 year and 0.4 kg, P = .01 at 7.5 years). No tendency toward weight gain was observed in intervention group women overall or when stratified by age, ethnicity, or body mass index. Weight loss was greatest among women in either group who decreased their percentage of energy from fat. A similar but lesser trend was observed with increases in vegetable and fruit servings, and a nonsignificant trend toward weight loss occurred with increasing intake of fiber.","A low-fat eating pattern does not result in weight gain in postmenopausal women.

1094,26330303,"Physical inactivity and overweight are risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer. The effect of physical activity may be partially mediated by concordant weight loss. We studied the effect on serum sex hormones, which are known to be associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, that is attributable to exercise by comparing randomly obtained equivalent weight loss by following a hypocaloric diet only or mainly by exercise.","Overweight, insufficiently active women were randomised to a diet (N = 97), mainly exercise (N = 98) or control group (N = 48). The goal of both interventions was to achieve 5-6 kg of weight loss by following a calorie-restricted diet or an intensive exercise programme combined with only a small caloric restriction. Primary outcomes after 16 weeks were serum sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Body fat and lean mass were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.","Both the diet (-4.9 kg) and mainly exercise (-5.5 kg) groups achieved the target weight loss. Loss of body fat was significantly greater with exercise versus diet (difference -1.4 kg, P &lt; 0.001). In the mainly exercise arm, the reduction in free testosterone was statistically significantly greater than that of the diet arm (treatment effect ratio [TER] 0.92, P = 0.043), and the results were suggestive of a difference for androstenedione (TER 0.90, P = 0.064) and SHBG (TER 1.05, P = 0.070). Compared with the control arm, beneficial effects were seen with both interventions, diet and mainly exercise, respectively, on oestradiol (TER 0.86, P = 0.025; TER 0.83, P = 0.007), free oestradiol (TER 0.80, P = 0.002; TER 0.77, P &lt; 0.001), SHBG (TER 1.14; TER 1.21, both P &lt; 0.001) and free testosterone (TER 0.91, P = 0.069; TER = 0.84, P = 0.001). After adjustment for changes in body fat, intervention effects attenuated or disappeared.","Weight loss with both interventions resulted in favourable effects on serum sex hormones, which have been shown to be associated with a decrease in postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Weight loss induced mainly by exercise additionally resulted in maintenance of lean mass, greater fitness, greater fat loss and a larger effect on (some) sex hormones. The greater fat loss likely explains the observed larger effects on sex hormones."
1095,25730591,"Dance movement therapy (DMT) is premised on an interconnected body and mind. It has known benefits for cancer patients' physical and psychological health and quality of life.To offer greater insight into a previous randomized controlled trial, the present study qualitatively explored the beneficial elements of DMT over the course of radiotherapy. To better understand the uniqueness of DMT intervention for patients receiving radiotherapy, the study statistically compared them with patients who received DMT after treatment completion.",Participants were randomized into radiotherapy and postradiotherapy control groups. The radiotherapy group received DMT (6 sessions at 90 minutes each) as they were undergoing radiotherapy. The postradiotherapy group was provided with the same DMT intervention at 1 to 2 months after completing radiotherapy.,"One hundred and four participants identified 5 main benefit categories. Dance movement therapy helped them (1) cope with cancer, treatment, and physical symptoms; (2) improve mental well-being, attention, and appreciation for the self and body; (3) improve total functioning; (4) bridge back to a normal and better life; and (5) participate in shared positive experiences. The radiotherapy group reported categories 1 and 2 more prominently than did the postradiotherapy group.",The findings reinforced the benefits of DMT while adding the new perspective that delivering DMT intervention throughout cancer treatment can have different and even additional benefits for patients.The pleasure of dancing and the psychological and physical relief from DMT help patients cope with daily radiation treatments. This could decrease treatment dropout rates when administered in clinical settings.
1096,12479768,"There has been increasing interest in the use of health-related quality-of-life (HRQL) assessments in daily clinical practice, yet few empirical studies have been conducted to evaluate the usefulness of such assessments.To evaluate the efficacy of standardized HRQL assessments in facilitating patient-physician communication and increasing physicians' awareness of their patients' HRQL-related problems.","Prospective, randomized crossover trial.Outpatient clinic of a cancer hospital in the Netherlands.Ten physicians and 214 patients (76% women; mean age, 57 years) undergoing palliative chemotherapy who were invited to participate between June 1996 and June 1998.At 3 successive outpatient visits, patients completed an HRQL questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30). The responses were computer scored and transformed into a graphic summary. Physicians and patients received a copy of the summary before the consultation.Audiotapes of the consultations were content analyzed to evaluate patient-physician communication. Physicians' awareness of their patients' health problems was assessed by comparing physicians' and patients' ratings on the Dartmouth Primary Care Cooperative Information Functional Health Assessment (COOP) and the World Organisation Project of National Colleges and Academics (WONCA) charts.","The HRQL-related issues were discussed significantly more frequently in the intervention than in the control group (mean [SD] communication composite scores: 4.5 [2.3] vs 3.7 [1.9], respectively (P =.01). Physicians in the intervention group identified a greater percentage of patients with moderate-to-severe health problems in several HRQL domains than did those in the control group. All physicians and 87% of the patients believed that the intervention facilitated communication and expressed interest in its continued use.",Incorporating standardized HRQL assessments in daily clinical oncology practice facilitates the discussion of HRQL issues and can heighten physicians' awareness of their patients' HRQL.

Our objective was to test the efficacy of an educational material on the knowledge, attitudes, and screening practices for SPC among cancer survivors.","Randomized, controlled trial among 326 cancer survivors from 6 oncology care outpatient clinics in Korea. Patients were randomized to an intervention or an attention control group. The intervention was a photo-novel, culturally tailored to increase knowledge about SPC screening. Knowledge and attitudes regarding SPC screening were assessed two weeks after the intervention, and screening practices were assessed after one year.","At two weeks post-intervention, the average knowledge score was significantly higher in the intervention compared to the control group (0.81 vs. 0.75, P&lt;0.01), with no significant difference in their attitude scores (2.64 vs. 2.57, P = 0.18). After 1 year of follow-up, the completion rate of all appropriate cancer screening was 47.2% in both intervention and control groups.","While the educational material was effective for increasing knowledge of SPC screening, it did not promote cancer screening practice among cancer survivors. More effective interventions are needed to increase SPC screening rates in this population."
1098,29599089,"Vaccination with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for 11-12\u202fyears-old, but uptake is suboptimal. Current messaging focuses on HPV infection transmission and prevention. Parents and providers are often uncomfortable discussing sexual practices of adolescents, contributing to the delay/refusal of vaccine. We created a cervical cancer-salient message encouraging HPV vaccination, emphasizing disease salience and disease threat, while promoting self-efficacy. We hypothesized this message would have greater effects on vaccine confidence and intent to vaccinate compared to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and non-vaccine control messages.",A 3-arm randomized trial was conducted. Parents of girls aged 9-17 were eligible for the study. We measured participants' vaccine confidence and intent to vaccinate at baseline and post intervention message. Recruitment and surveys were administered online through Amazon Mechanical Turk.,"762 participants completed both surveys. We saw modest increases in vaccine confidence when comparing cervical cancer arm and control arm, and CDC arm and control arm; estimates were not statistically significant. The odds of reporting intent to vaccinate among the cervical cancer message arm were 1.13 times the odds of reporting intent to vaccinate in the control arm (95% CI: 0.30. 4.29). Intent to vaccinate was also not statistically significantly different between CDC message arm and control arm (OR\u202f=\u202f1.25, 95%CI: 0.66, 2.37).","Neither message had effect on intent to vaccinate, highlighting need for research to identify successful messaging strategies for HPV. Exploratory analyses suggest among parents with 'Low' vaccine confidence at baseline, the cervical cancer framed message may be more effective in changing intention than the CDC message or non-vaccine control. Future work should target groups with 'Low' or 'Medium' vaccine confidence at baseline - they may be more amenable to change, and more receptive to disease-salient messaging."
1099,22822181,To investigate the impact of aquatic exercise on pressure pain threshold in breast cancer survivors with hormone therapy-associated arthralgia.,"Single-blind, controlled trial.Two major metropolitan hospitals and a Sport and Spa Club in Granada, Spain.Forty women aged 29-71 years with stage I-III breast cancer who reported arthralgia.Patients were allocated alternately to either aquatic exercise in a chest-high pool or usual care while on the waiting list; control patients received treatment later. The two-month hydrotherapy intervention consisted of 24 sessions 3 days per week. Each session included 5 minutes of warm-up, 15-20 minutes of aerobic exercise, 15 minutes of mobility exercise and 20 minutes of recovery techniques.Pressure pain threshold at neck, shoulder, hand and leg were evaluated as primary outcomes. Cancer-related fatigue, as measured by the Piper Fatigue Scale, body mass index and waist circumference were secondary outcomes. A 2 \u00d7 2 repeated-measure ANCOVA was used in this study.","No adverse events or development of worsening of pain was observed. Almost all the participants in the intervention group (89%) adhered to the hydrotherapy programme. Participants experienced a decrease in pressure pain threshold measured in neck, hand, shoulder and leg, as measured by algometry pressure, and waist circumference; all P &lt; 0.05. Cancer-related fatigue (P = 0.06) and body mass index (P = 0.42) did not show significant improvement.",These data suggest that hydrotherapy in a chest-high pool may reduce the pain threshold and waist circumference in breast cancer survivors with hormone therapy-associated arthralgia.
1100,21875929,"To clinically evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture when used in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN).During cancer treatment, certain chemotherapies can cause varying degrees of PN. Patients' quality of life can be seriously impaired through loss of sensation, pain or mobility problems. Conventional medications routinely used to manage neuropathic symptoms have poor side-effect profiles and there is little or no evidence justifying their use to treat chemotherapy-related neurotoxicities. There are studies suggesting that acupuncture may be an effective therapy in treating PN across a number of different aetiologies. Design A retrospective service evaluation.","Patients (n=18) were referred for acupuncture by the medical staff and/ornurse specialists or they self-referred for treatment. A course of six weekly acupuncture sessions was offered to them, and their details were recorded on an evaluation form prior to session one. Points were selected by acupuncturists, based on patient presentation, and needles remained in situ for 30-45 min. Treatments took place in outpatient clinics, chemotherapy day case ward or a drop-in clinic based in a physiotherapy gym. The evaluation form was completed at the end of session 6 by a therapist who had not been involved in patient care.","82% (n=14) of patients reported an improvement in symptoms following their course of acupuncture; one patient with advanced disease died during the 6 weeks. Some patients derived additional benefits from the treatment including a reduction in analgesic use and improved sleeping patterns. The most common acupoints used were SP6 (n=18), ST36 (n=18) and LV3 (n=14).","Although these results are encouraging, they are uncontrolled. They suggest that acupuncture could be an option for these patients and controlled trials using validated patient-reported outcome measures are justified."

Process measures in the three-dose group changed as expected. No relationship existed between content changes and outcome measures.","Emotional expression is feasible for patients with cancer, but the efficacy of the intervention in improving mood and decreasing cognitive intrusion and avoidance was not supported. Emotional expression processes were consistent with those seen in other samples and may influence outcomes that were not addressed in this study.More extensive testing is needed, including additional outcome variables. Essays reveal concerns around communication, recurrence, and health behavior changes that should be considered in practice."
1102,20820172,We examined the effects of an aerobic exercise intervention on adiposity outcomes that may be involved in the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk.,"This study was a two-centre, two-armed, randomized controlled trial. The 1-year-long exercise intervention included 45\u2009 min of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise five times per week, with at least three of the sessions being facility based. The control group was asked not to change their activity and both groups were asked not to change their diet.A total of 320 postmenopausal, sedentary, normal weight-to-obese women aged 50-74 years who were cancer-free, nondiabetic and nonhormone replacement therapy users were included in this study.Anthropometric measurements of height, weight and waist and hip circumferences; dual energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements of total body fat; and computerized tomography measurements of abdominal adiposity were carried out.",Women in the exercise group exercised a mean of 3.6 days (s.d.=1.3) per week and 178.5\u2009 min (s.d.=76.1) per week. Changes in all measures of adiposity favored exercisers relative to controls (P&lt;0.001). The mean difference between groups was: -1.8\u2009 kg for body weight; -2.0\u2009 kg for total body fat; -14.9\u2009 cm(2) for intra-abdominal fat area; and -24.1\u2009 cm(2) for subcutaneous abdominal fat area. A linear trend of greater body fat loss with increasing volume of exercise was also observed.,A 1-year aerobic exercise program consistent with current public health guidelines resulted in reduced adiposity levels in previously sedentary postmenopausal women at higher risk of breast cancer.

There was no significant difference between the two groups in intention to be tested within the next 12 months. 87% of men found the brief pDA was easy to read, 94% considered it contained about the right amount of detail and 94% felt the information was presented in a balanced way. Multivariate analysis identified perceived risk (p&lt;0.0001), perceived benefits of PSA testing (p&lt;0.0001), knowledge (p=0.004), attitude (p=0.007) and age (p=0.01) as the most important independent predictors of intention to be tested amongst men in the intervention group.","The brief pDA was shown to dramatically increase men's knowledge of the benefits and risks of the PSA test. Men who received the brief pDA were significantly less positive about the PSA test, although there was no difference between the two groups regarding their intention to be tested within the next year.This brief pDA could serve as an acceptable and low cost adjunct to counselling by the General Practitioner (GP), and should promote informed decision making regarding the PSA test. Further research is required to ascertain the utility of the decision aid during the consultation."

1110,25449185,"Sixty percent of cancer survivors are 65years of age or older. Cancer and its treatments lead to cancer-related fatigue and many other side effects, in turn, creating substantial global side-effect burden (total burden from all side effects) which, ultimately, compromises functional independence and quality of life. Various modes of exercise, such as yoga, reduce cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in younger cancer survivors, but no studies have specifically examined the effects of yoga on older cancer survivors.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 4-week yoga intervention (Yoga for Cancer Survivors: YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae) on overall cancer-related fatigue, and due to its multidimensional nature, the subdomains of cancer-related fatigue (general, physical, emotional, and mental) and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.","We conducted a secondary analysis on data from a multicenter phase III randomized controlled clinical trial with 2 arms (standard care and standard care plus a 4-week YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae intervention). The sample for this secondary analysis was 97 older cancer survivors (\u226560years of age), between 2months and 2years post-treatment, who participated in the original trial.","Participants in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae intervention arm reported significantly lower cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden than participants in the standard care arm following the 4-week intervention period (p&lt;0.05).","YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is an effective standardized yoga intervention for reducing cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden among older cancer survivors."
1111,22958507,"To evaluate the effects of an 8-week water physical therapy program on cervical and shoulder pain, pressure sensitivity, and the presence of trigger points (TrPs) in breast cancer survivors.","Randomized, controlled trial.To date, no study has investigated effects of water therapy in breast cancer.Sixty-six breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned into two groups: WATER group, who received a water exercise program or CONTROL group who received the usual care treatment for breast cancer.The WATER therapy program consisted of 24 sessions (3 times/week over 8 weeks) of low-intensity exercises in a warm pool (32\u00b0C). Each session included 10-minute warm-up period; 35 minutes of aerobic, low-intensity endurance, and core stability training; and a 15-minute cool-down period (stretching and relaxation).","Neck and shoulder pain (visual analog scale, 0-100\u2003mm), pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) over C5-C6 zygapophyseal joints, deltoid muscles, second metacarpal, and tibialis anterior muscles, and the presence of TrPs in cervical-shoulder muscles were assessed at baseline and after the 8-week program by an assessor blinded to treatment allocation.The WATER group demonstrated a between-group improvement for neck pain of -31\u2003mm (95% confidence interval [CI]-49 to -22, P\u2003&lt;\u20030.001; effect size 1.1, 0.81-1.75) and for shoulder-axillary of -19\u2003mm (-40 to -04, P\u2003=\u20030.046; effect size 0.70, 0.14-1.40). Improvements were also noted for PPT levels over C5-C6 joints (between-group differences, affected side: 27.7\u2003kPa, 95% CI 3.9-50.4; unaffected: 18.1\u2003kPa, 95% CI 6.1-52.2). No between-group differences for PPT over the remaining points were observed (P\u2003&gt;\u20030.05). Finally, patients in the WATER program showed a greater reduction of active TrPs as compared with the CONTROL group (P\u2003&lt;\u20030.05).","An 8-week water therapy program was effective for improving neck and shoulder/axillary pain, and reducing the presence of TrPs in breast cancer survivors as compared with usual care; however, no significant changes in widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia were found."
1112,30340503,"Exercise is an effective strategy to improve quality of life and physical fitness in breast cancer survivors; however, few studies have focused on the early survivorship period, minorities, physically inactive and obese women, or tested a combined exercise program and measured bone health. Here, we report the effects of a 16-week aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on patient-reported outcomes, physical fitness, and bone health in ethnically diverse, physically inactive, overweight or obese breast cancer survivors.","One hundred breast cancer survivors within 6\u00a0months of completing adjuvant treatment were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up (exercise group only) for physical fitness, bone mineral density, serum concentrations of bone biomarkers, and quality of life. The exercise intervention consisted of moderate-vigorous (65-85% heart rate maximum) aerobic and resistance exercise thrice weekly for 16\u00a0weeks. Differences in mean changes for outcomes were evaluated using mixed-model repeated measure analysis.","At post-intervention, the exercise group was superior to usual care for quality of life (between group difference: 14.7, 95% CI: 18.2, 9.7; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), fatigue (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), depression (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), estimated VO (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), muscular strength (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001), osteocalcin (p\u2009=\u20090.01), and BSAP (p\u2009=\u20090.001). At 3-month follow-up, all patient-reported outcomes and physical fitness variables remained significantly improved compared to baseline in the exercise group (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01).",A 16-week combined aerobic and resistance exercise program designed to address metabolic syndrome in ethnically-diverse overweight or obese breast cancer survivors also significantly improved quality of life and physical fitness. Our findings further support the inclusion of supervised clinical exercise programs into breast cancer treatment and care.
1113,30514351,"Impaired physical function due to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms may lead to diminished quality of life. However, even with the knowledge of the effects of CIPN on physical function, clinicians infrequently assess and manage CIPN. Interventions that prioritize the early identification of CIPN to provide prompt treatment may reduce the impact of CIPN on physical function. The purpose of this paper is to compare self-reported physical function in individuals receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy between Electronic Symptom Assessment-Cancer (ESRA-C) intervention group (e.g., opportunity for symptom screening, self-care recommendations, communication coaching, and symptom tracking) and control group participants (i.e., electronic assessment alone). Secondary outcomes include pain intensity, sensory/motor CIPN, depression, fatigue, and insomnia.","The data used in this paper are a subset of a randomized controlled trial that examined the impact of the ESRA-C intervention on symptom distress in individuals receiving cancer treatment. Since the interest in this analysis is on the effects of neurotoxic chemotherapy on physical function, subjects were included if they received platinum and/or taxane-based chemotherapy and completed the baseline and end-of-treatment measures. Participants completed standardized questionnaires of physical function, CIPN, fatigue, depression, pain intensity, and insomnia prior to treatment, 3-6\u2009weeks after treatment initiation, and after the completion of treatment. Changes in mean scores are compared between groups using linear mixed models adjusting for age.","Intervention group participants reported significantly less reduction in physical functioning (baseline: 87.4/100; end-of-treatment: 84.5/100) relative to the control (baseline: 90.2/100; end-of-treatment: 81.8/100) (p\u2009=\u20090.011). For secondary measures, significantly less depression (p\u2009=\u20090.005) was observed in the intervention group as compared to the control, but otherwise, there were no between-group differences. Among participants who received high cumulative doses of neurotoxic chemotherapy, the intervention group reported significantly less severe sensory (p\u2009=\u20090.007) and motor CIPN (p\u2009=\u20090.039) relative to the control.",Use of the ESRA-C intervention led to less reduction in physical function in comparison to the control in individuals receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy. Further research is needed to confirm our findings and to identify how electronic symptom assessment technology may mediate physical function preservation.
1114,18093117,"To evaluate a nurse-led clinic for patients undergoing radiotherapy to the head and neck.The side effects of radiotherapy to the head and neck are superimposed on already significant physical and psychological morbidity. Medical review clinics tend to focus on treatment complications and there is evidence that specialist nurses can provide more holistic care for patients. However, doubts have been raised about the appropriateness of nurse-led review in this highly symptomatic and complex group.","This evaluation compared medical on-treatment review (Phase 1) with a nurse-led clinic (Phase 2) for patients having radiotherapy to the head and neck, using an historical control group.Twenty patients were reviewed by their consultant and 23 by a nurse specialist, using a clinic protocol. A mixed-method approach to data collection was taken. Patients completed weekly quality of life questionnaires and were asked about their experiences of support and care. General practitioners completed a questionnaire about the communication received from the clinic. Checklists assessed the content of clinic consultations.","Patients valued the relationship developed with the nurse specialist, had longer, more frequent consultations and were more often referred to the multidisciplinary team. The nurse specialist managed 83% of consultations without referral to the consultant. Few significant differences in quality of life were found between the groups. There were indications that oral and nutritional problems were managed more effectively in the nurse-led clinic, although emotional functioning was higher in the medical group. GPs were positive about the timing and content of information received.",On-treatment review for patients with head and neck cancer can be effectively managed by a nurse specialist. Relevance to Practice. Radiotherapy nurse specialists make an important contribution to the supportive care of patients with head and neck cancer. More investment is required to maximize their contribution.

The call was tailored on four variables: individual mammography history, mailing of the invitation letter, mammography appointment date, and type of mammography facility in the area (e.g., mobile unit versus fixed site). Community peer volunteers made up to three attempts to call the women in the intervention arm.Mammography rates verified by screening registration review and adverse events identified in contacts with peer volunteers, radiologists, and community workers of local authorities.","A total of 3,880 women were included in the study and individually randomized into control and intervention groups. Phone numbers were identified for 79% of the women in the intervention group, and 69% were contacted. Twenty-two percent had screening mammography, which was 4% higher than controls (relative risk = 1.22). No adverse effects were identified. An additional mammogram came at an average cost of 17 phone conversations and two hours of volunteer work.",The tested telephone reminder call is suitable for Belgian women.The telephone reminder call may be implemented in settings similar to the studied context.

No participant withdrew because of study adverse events. Ten-week outcomes (n=52) included a significant increase in SPPB total score (P&lt;.001), increase in gait speed (P=.001), and reduction in fatigue (P=.05). Although cardiovascular exercise participants had a modestly greater improvement in SPPB total score than resistance training participants (F1,49=4.21, P=.045), the difference was not confirmed in a subsequent intention-to-treat analysis (N=66).",Individuals with advanced cancer appear to benefit from exercise for improving functional mobility. Neither resistance nor cardiovascular exercise appeared to have a strong differential effect on outcome.

Data were collected during the patients' first postoperative visit (baseline), 1 month after surgery, and 3 months after surgery.","After adjusting for covariates, the levels of symptom distress and unmet needs for participants in the experimental group were lower at 1 and 3 months after surgery than for those in the control group, with the results at 3 months achieving significance. However, the sexuality needs for both groups were not significantly different at 1 and 3 months. Furthermore, levels of state anxiety were significantly lower for the experimental group at 1 and 3 months than for the control group.","The education and psychological support components of our intervention programme effectively improved the unmet supportive care needs of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer 3 months after surgery. Following prolonged treatment, women with breast cancer still have physical, psychological, and information care needs. Thus, clinical healthcare personnel should continually and actively provide culturally sensitive, individualised, and accessible information and psychological support to these patients."

Development of effective interventions to change nurses' negative outcome expectancies in communication with cancer patients is needed in further study.
1130,28994035,"This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of SurvivorCHESS, an eHealth intervention, on physical activity in colon cancer survivors and to explore the impact of SurvivorCHESS on quality of life and distress.",This was a two-arm single-blinded multi-site randomized controlled trial comparing a control group to an intervention group receiving a smartphone with the SurvivorCHESS program.,Participants using SurvivorCHESS (n\u00a0=\u00a0144) increased their moderate to vigorous physical activities from 19.4\u00a0min at baseline to 50\u00a0min compared to the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a0140) increasing from 15.5 to 40.3\u00a0min at 6\u00a0months (p\u00a0=\u00a0.083) but was not sustained 3\u00a0months after the study ended. No significant differences were found between groups over time for quality of life or distress items. Reports of physical symptoms were greater than other categories for distress items. Patients who had a higher body mass index and number of comorbid conditions were less likely to increase their physical activity. Self-determination theory including autonomous motivation and relatedness was not associated with the outcomes.,"Physical activity did increase over time in both groups and was not significantly different with the use of the eHealth intervention, SurvivorCHESS, compared to the control group. The amount of SurvivorCHESS use was not associated with physical activity.Increasing physical activity in colon cancer survivors has the potential to improve quality of life and reduce recurrences. Using smartphone-tracking devices may be useful in helping to change this health behavior."
1131,24871477,"Vegetarian diets have been associated with reduced mortality. Because a pure vegetarian diet might not easily be embraced by many individuals, consuming preferentially plant-derived foods would be a more easily understood message. A provegetarian food pattern (FP) emphasizing preference for plant-derived foods might reduce all-cause mortality.The objective was to identify the association between an a priori-defined provegetarian FP and all-cause mortality.","We followed 7216 participants (57% women; mean age: 67 y) at high cardiovascular risk for a median of 4.8 y. A validated 137-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire was administered at baseline and yearly thereafter. Fruit, vegetables, nuts, cereals, legumes, olive oil, and potatoes were positively weighted. Added animal fats, eggs, fish, dairy products, and meats or meat products were negatively weighted. Energy-adjusted quintiles were used to assign points to build the provegetarian FP (range: 12-60 points). Deaths were confirmed by review of medical records and the National Death Index.","There were 323 deaths during the follow-up period (76 from cardiovascular causes, 130 from cancer, 117 for noncancer, noncardiovascular causes). Higher baseline conformity with the provegetarian FP was associated with lower mortality (multivariable-adjusted HR for \u2265 40 compared with &lt;30 points: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.88). Similar results were found with the use of updated information on diet (RR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.89).","Among omnivorous subjects at high cardiovascular risk, better conformity with an FP that emphasized plant-derived foods was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.

After pretesting, individuals were assigned to either a wait list or intervention. Individuals in the wait-list group received the usual treatment before completing the post-test measures. Individuals in the intervention group participated in a one-hour art-making session, after which they completed post-test measures. Participants then crossed over to the other group.Art making, stress, state anxiety, and therapy-related symptoms.",Therapy-related symptom concerns for the intervention group at post-test were significantly lower than at pretest; no change ocurred in the control group. The salivary cortisol levels were significantly lower at post-test in the intervention and control groups. No change occurred in the anxiety levels of participants in the intervention and control groups. The study hypothesis was partially supported.,"Art making decreased therapy-related symptoms (e.g., feeling sluggish, difficulty concentrating). Use of more physiologic indices to measure stress and replication on a larger sample are suggested.Individuals receiving BMT may benefit from participation in art-making interventions. Art making is easy to implement in a clinic setting and allows for positive interactions between nurses and patients."

A goal of 5% reduction in body weight was set, and a personalised diet and physical activity (PA) programme was provided. Behavioural change techniques (motivational interviewing, action and coping plans and implementation intentions) were used.Feasibility measures: recruitment, programme implementation, fidelity measures, achieved measurements and retention, participant satisfaction assessed by questionnaire and qualitative interviews.","Measured changes in weight and PA and reported diet and psychosocial measures between baseline and 12-week follow-up.Of 480 patients approached, 196 (41%) expressed interest in the study, and of those, 78 (40%) patients were randomised. Implementation of the programme was challenging within the time allotted and fidelity to the intervention modest (62%). Qualitative findings indicated the programme was well received. Questionnaires and anthropometric data were completed by &gt;98%. Accelerometer data were attained by 84% and 54% at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Retention at 12 weeks was 76%.

The experimental group experienced a greater improvement in all values after the program compared with the control group. There were no significant changes in the other pressure pain threshold points, pain severity, interference of pain, or the remaining ultrasound imaging measurements.","The CO-CUIDATE program is effective for improving the musculoskeletal conditions related to the lumbopelvic area in colon cancer survivors, specifically in relation to pain and the internal oblique thickness."
1137,9565385,To study the effects of three approaches to increasing utilization of screening mammography in a public hospital setting in Northwest Louisiana.,"Randomized intervention study.Four hundred forty-five women aged 40 years and over, predominantly low-income and with low literacy skills, who had not had a mammogram in the preceding year.All interventions were chosen to motivate women to get a mammogram. Group 1 received a personal recommendation from one of the investigators. Group 2 received the recommendation plus an easy-to-read National Cancer Institute (NCI) brochure. Group 3 received the recommendation, the brochure, and a 12-minute interactive educational and motivational program, including a soap-opera-style video, developed in collaboration with women from the target population.","Mammography utilization was determined at 6 months and 2 years after intervention. A significant increase (p = .05) in mammography utilization was observed after the intervention designed in collaboration with patients (29%) as compared with recommendation alone (21%) or recommendation with brochure (18%) at 6 months. However, at 2 years the difference favoring the custom-made intervention was no longer significant.","At 6 months there was at least a 30% increase in the mammography utilization rate in the group receiving the intervention designed in collaboration with patients as compared with those receiving the recommendation alone or recommendation with brochure. Giving patients an easy-to-read NCI brochure and a personal recommendation was no more effective than giving them a recommendation alone, suggesting that simply providing women in a public hospital with a low-literacy-level, culturally appropriate brochure is not sufficient to increase screening mammography rates. In a multivariate analysis, the only significant predictor of mammography use at 6 months was the custom-made intervention."
1138,30197186,A large proportion of individuals with a positive faecal immunologic test (FIT) will never undergo the recommended colonoscopy despite a full sequence of reminders.This prospective study aimed to recruit refractory individuals by a motivational personalised phone call given by a screening physician.,We evaluated the impact of a motivational phone call given by a physician of the screening organisation in order to convince patients with positive FIT to undergo a colonoscopy.,"115 individuals with a positive FIT were targeted. After GP phone call, it was ascertained that 15 had had a colonoscopy, one died, one moved outside the region, and the GP refused the study phone call for 13. Finally, we attempted to call 85 individuals; 24 could not be reached, 5 colonoscopies had been performed, and thus 56 individuals were included. The main reason for colonoscopy refusal (33.9%) was wrong advice from the GP or the gastroenterologist. Among those included, 33.9% (19/56) underwent the colonoscopy within 22.7 months after FIT; 1 invasive cancer, 18 adenomas and 9 serrated sessile lesions were found.",Motivational phone call performed by a physician from the screening organisation is effective to recruit a third of refractory individuals. Education for GPs and gastroenterologists is necessary to increase participation to colonoscopy and to avoid the performance of an inappropriate secondary FIT.

As referrals continue to increase, health care organizations are encouraged to find more effective methods for providing high-quality patient care with cost savings.To evaluate the use of remote video technology in the home health care setting as well as the quality, use, patient satisfaction, and cost savings from this technology.","Quasi-experimental study conducted from May 1996 to October 1997.Home health department in the Sacramento, Calif, facility of a large health maintenance organization.Newly referred patients diagnosed as having congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral vascular accident, cancer, diabetes, anxiety, or need for wound care were eligible for random assignment to intervention (n = 102) or control (n = 110) groups.The control and intervention groups received routine home health care (home visits and telephone contact). The intervention group also had access to a remote video system that allowed nurses and patients to interact in real time. The video system included peripheral equipment for assessing cardiopulmonary status.Three quality indicators (medication compliance, knowledge of disease, and ability for self-care); extent of use of services; degree of patient satisfaction as reported on a 3-part scale; and direct and indirect costs of using the remote video technology.","No differences in the quality indicators, patient satisfaction, or use were seen. Although the average direct cost for home health services was $1830 in the intervention group and $1167 in the control group, the total mean costs of care, excluding home health care costs, were $1948 in the intervention group and $2674 in the control group.","Remote video technology in the home health care setting was shown to be effective, well received by patients, capable of maintaining quality of care, and to have the potential for cost savings. Patients seemed pleased with the equipment and the ability to access a home health care provider 24 hours a day. Remote technology has the potential to effect cost savings when used to substitute some in-person visits and can also improve access to home health care staff for patients and caregivers. This technology can thus be an asset for patients and providers."
1140,17533068,Monthly thorough skin self-examination (TSSE) is an important practice for early melanoma detection that is performed by a small minority of the population.,"A randomized trial was conducted to determine whether a multicomponent intervention can increase TSSE performance and to describe the effects on performance of skin surgeries compared with a similar control intervention focused on diet.One thousand three hundred fifty-six patients attending a routine primary care visit in southeastern New England participated in this trial.Participants received instructional materials, including cues and aids, a video, and a brief counseling session and (at 3 weeks) a brief follow-up phone call (from a health educator) and tailored feedback letters.Performance of TSSE assessed by telephone interview and having a surgical procedure performed on the skin were confirmed by examining medical records.","TSSE was performed by substantially more participants at 2, 6, and 12 months in the intervention group than in the control group (55% vs 35%, p&lt;0.0001 at 12 months). We also noted that a substantially higher proportion in the intervention group had skin surgery in the first 6 months (8.0% vs 3.6%, p=0.0005), but there was no difference at 6 to 12 months (3.9% vs 3.3%, p=0.5).","The TSSE intervention was effective in increasing performance of TSSE, in that it resulted in increased surgery on the skin, and that increase in skin procedures only persisted for 6 months. Intervention to increase TSSE may result in long-term benefit in early detection of melanoma while causing only a short-term excess of skin surgeries."
1141,26050790,"Exercise started shortly after breast cancer diagnosis might prevent or diminish fatigue complaints. The Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment (PACT) study was designed to primarily examine the effects of an 18-week exercise intervention, offered in the daily clinical practice setting and starting within 6 weeks after diagnosis, on preventing an increase in fatigue.","This multi-centre controlled trial randomly assigned 204 breast cancer patients to usual care (n = 102) or supervised aerobic and resistance exercise (n = 102). By design, all patients received chemotherapy between baseline and 18 weeks. Fatigue (i.e., primary outcome at 18 weeks), quality of life, anxiety, depression, and physical fitness were measured at 18 and 36 weeks.","Intention-to-treat mixed linear model analyses showed that physical fatigue increased significantly less during cancer treatment in the intervention group compared to control (mean between-group differences at 18 weeks: -1.3; 95 % CI -2.5 to -0.1; effect size -0.30). Results for general fatigue were comparable but did not reach statistical significance (-1.0, 95%CI -2.1; 0.1; effect size -0.23). At 18 weeks, submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness and several muscle strength tests (leg extension and flexion) were significantly higher in the intervention group compared to control, whereas peak oxygen uptake did not differ between groups. At 36 weeks these differences were no longer statistically significant. Quality of life outcomes favoured the exercise group but were not significantly different between groups.","A supervised 18-week exercise programme offered early in routine care during adjuvant breast cancer treatment showed positive effects on physical fatigue, submaximal cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle strength. Exercise early during treatment of breast cancer can be recommended. At 36 weeks, these effects were no longer statistically significant. This might have been caused by the control participants' high physical activity levels during follow-up."
1142,17562630,To test the effects of an art-making class (AMC) on reducing anxiety and stress among family caregivers of patients with cancer.,"A pretest and post-test quasi-experimental design.A residential care facility near tertiary treatment centers in the southeastern United States.The convenience sample of 69 family caregivers was aged 18-81 years (X = 48 years) and predominantly Catholic. Most had at least a high school education. Two-thirds were daughters, wives, or mothers of patients with cancer.Participants completed a demographic data survey and a Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Researchers collected a saliva sample from each participant to measure salivary cortisol, which indicates stress levels. Following pretesting, a two-hour AMC was delivered. Post-tests included a repeat BAI and a second saliva sample.Anxiety and stress.",Anxiety was significantly reduced after AMC. Stress was reduced.,The AMC appeared to reduce anxiety and stress. The addition of a control group and replication with larger numbers are suggested. The physiologic cortisol measure corroborated BAI findings but was difficult to obtain from some cultural groups and was expensive to analyze.Family caregivers may benefit from participation in art-making interventions. Nurses should continue to investigate the use of creative approaches to promote holistic care.
1143,8360932,"A number of vitamins and minerals have been shown to influence carcinogenesis in experimental animals. In humans, epidemiologic evidence suggests that intake of fruits and vegetables may reduce risk of esophageal and other cancers. Vitamins and minerals in these foods may contribute to the reduced cancer risk. The people of Linxian, China, have persistently low intake of multiple nutrients and exhibit one of the world's highest rates of esophageal/gastric cardia cancer, with an exceptionally high risk of esophageal dysplasia.To determine whether supplementation with multiple vitamins and minerals may reduce esophageal/gastric cardia cancer among persons with esophageal dysplasia, we conducted a 6-year prospective intervention trial in Linxian.","Mortality and cancer incidence were ascertained from May 1985 through May 1991 for 3318 persons with cytologic evidence of esophageal dysplasia who were randomly assigned to receive, throughout that period, daily supplementation with 14 vitamins and 12 minerals or placebo. Doses were typically two to three times U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances. Compliance was assessed by counting unused pills monthly for all trial participants and by assaying nutrient levels in blood collected from samples of individuals randomly selected without replacement every 3 months throughout the trial. Cancers were identified through routine surveillance and by special cytology and endoscopy screenings after 2 1/2 years and 6 years.","A total of 324 deaths occurred during the 6-year intervention period; 167 occurred in the control (placebo) group and 157 occurred in the supplement group. Cancer was the leading cause of death (54% of all deaths); 18% were due to cerebrovascular diseases and 29% to other causes. Cumulative esophageal/gastric cardia death rates were 8% lower (relative risk [RR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67-1.28) among individuals receiving supplements rather than placebo, a nonsignificant (P &gt; .10) difference. Risk of total mortality was 7% lower (RR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.75-1.16; P &gt; .10), total cancer 4% lower (RR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.71-1.29; P &gt; .10), cerebrovascular disease 38% lower (RR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.37-1.06; P = .08), and other diseases 12% higher (RR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.74-1.69; P &gt; .10) among the treated group. Cumulative cancer incidence rates were nearly the same in the two groups.","No substantial short-term beneficial effect on incidence or mortality for this type of cancer occurred following daily supplementation with multiple vitamins and minerals among adults with precancerous lesions of the esophagus.Although no statistically significant short-term benefits were observed, longer follow-up should be more informative about the effectiveness of this 6-year supplementation on cancer and other diseases among individuals with esophageal dysplasia."
1144,25653009,Tai Chi is the Chinese traditional medicine exercise for mind-body health. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) exercise on the proliferative and cytolytic/tumoricidal activities of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in postsurgical non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.,"Patients (n\u2009=\u200927) were randomly divided into the control group (n\u2009=\u200913) and the TCC group (n\u2009=\u200914). TCC group participated in Tai Chi 24-type exercise for 16\u00a0weeks, 60-min every time, and three times a week. Peripheral blood was collected and PBMCs isolated before and after the 16-week TCC, PBMC proliferation and co-culture of PBMCs with the NSCLC cell line A549 were performed for proliferation and cell cytolysis assays. Analysis of NKT cells, NK cells, and CD123+ and CD11c\u2009+\u2009dendritic cells were also performed.","(1) After 16-week of TCC, cell proliferation increased significantly as compared with the control. (2) PBMCs from the TCC group also demonstrated enhanced cytolytic/oncolytic activity against A549 cells. (3) Significant differences were also found in NK cell percentage at t\u2009=\u200916\u00a0weeks, post-pre changes of NKT and DC11c between groups.",Regular Tai Chi exercise has the promise of enhancing PBMC proliferative and cytolytic activities in NSCLC patients. Our results affirm the value of a future trial with a larger scale and longer duration for cancer survivors.
1145,22160629,"This study aimed to determine the effect of a moderate, tailored exercise program on health-related quality of life, physical function, and arm volume in women receiving treatment for nonmetastatic breast cancer.","Women who were within 4-12 weeks of surgery for stage I-III breast cancer were randomized to center-based exercise and lymphedema education intervention or patient education. Functional assessment of cancer therapy-breast cancer (FACT-B), 6-min walk, and arm volume were performed at 3-month intervals through 18 months. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was used to model the total meters walked over time, FACT-B scores, and arm volume. Models were adjusted for baseline measurement, baseline affected arm volume, number of nodes removed, age, self-reported symptoms, baseline SF-12 mental and physical component scores, visit, and treatment group.","Of the recruited 104 women, 82 completed all 18 months. Mean age (range) was 53.6 (32-82) years; 88% were Caucasian; 45% were employed full time; 44% were overweight; and 28% obese. Approximately, 46% had breast-conserving surgery; 79% had axillary node dissection; 59% received chemotherapy; and 64% received radiation. The intervention resulted in an average increase of 34.3 ml (SD\u2009=\u200912.8) versus patient education (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Changes in FACT-B scores and arm volumes were not significantly different.","With this early exercise intervention after breast cancer diagnosis, a significant improvement was achieved in physical function, with no decline in health-related quality of life or detrimental effect on arm volume.Starting a supervised exercise regimen that is tailored to an individual's strength and stamina within 3 months following breast cancer surgery appears safe and may hasten improvements in physical functioning."
1146,10857523,To evaluate the effect of early exercise therapy on the natural killer cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) of patients who had undergone curative resection of stomach cancer.,"Prospective study.Thirty-five stomach cancer patients who had undergone curative surgery were randomly divided into an exercise group (n = 17) and a control group (n = 18).From postoperative day 2, moderated exercise using arm and bicycle ergometers performed twice a day, 5 times a week, for 14 days. The intensity of exercise was 60% of maximal heart rate. Venous blood samples were obtained on postoperative days 1, 7, and 14.Mean sequential change of NKCA.","The mean sequential change of NKCA decreased until postoperative day 7 and then increased. Mean NKCA of day 7 decreased in both groups, compared with that at postoperative day 1. At day 14, the mean NKCA of the exercise group demonstrated a significant increase compared with that of the control group (p &lt; .05).",This study suggests that early moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the function of in vitro NK cells in stomach cancer patients after curative surgery.

Secondary end points were physical function, patient-reported outcomes, muscle strength, body composition, and biomarkers. Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at 6 and 12 mo adjusted for baseline values.","Participants undergoing supervised exercise showed improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness performance at 6 mo (-19 s [p=0.029]) and 12 mo (-13 s [p=0.028]) and better lower-body physical function across the 12-mo period (p&lt;0.01). Supervised exercise also improved self-reported physical functioning at 6 (p=.006) and 12 mo (p=0.002), appendicular skeletal muscle at 6 mo (p=0.019), and objective measures of muscle strength at 6 and 12 mo (p&lt;0.050). Limitations included the restricted number of participants undertaking body composition assessment, no blinding to group assignment for physical functioning measures, and inclusion of well-functioning individuals.","Supervised exercise training in long-term PCa survivors is more effective than physical activity educational material for increasing cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, muscle strength, and self-reported physical functioning at 6 mo. Importantly, these benefits were maintained in the long term with a home-based programme with follow-up at 12 mo."
1148,16332662,"Broccoli consumption is associated with a reduction in the risk of cancer, particularly in persons with a functional glutathione S-transferase M1 allele, as opposed rotrose whose GSTM1 gene has been deleted. Sulforaphane, the major isothiocyanate derived from 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate, is thought to be the main agent conferring protection.We compared sulforaphane metabolism in GSTM1-null and GSTM1-positive subjects after they consumed standard broccoli and high-glucosinolate broccoli (super broccoli).","Sixteen subjects were recruited into a randomized, 3-phase crossover dietary trial of standard broccoli, super broccoli, and water. Liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify sulforaphane and its thiol conjugates in plasma and urine.","GSTM1-null subjects had slightly higher, but statistically significant, areas under the curve for sulforaphane metabolite concentrations in plasma, a greater rate of urinary excretion of sulforaphane metabolites during the first 6 h after broccoli consumption, and a higher percentage of sulforaphane excretion 24 h after ingestion than did GSTM1-positive subjects. Consumption of high-glucosinolate broccoli led to a 3-fold greater increase in the areas under the curve and maximum concentrations of sulforaphane metabolites in plasma, a greater rate of urinary excretion of sulforaphane metabolites during the first 6 h after consumption, and a lower percentage of sulforaphane excretion after its ingestion than did the consumption of standard broccoli.",GSTM1 genotypes have a significant effect on the metabolism of sulforaphane derived from standard or high-glucosinolate broccoli. It is possible that the difference in metabolism may explain the greater protection that GSTM1-positive persons gain from consuming broccoli. The potential consequences of consuming glucosinolate-enriched broccoli for GSTM1-null and -positive persons are discussed.

Cancer patients often prefer their oncologist recommend an exercise program, yet a recommendation alone may not be enough to change behavior. Our study determined whether adding an exercise DVD to an oncologist's recommendation to exercise led to better outcomes than a recommendation alone.","Ninety breast cancer patients, at varying phases of treatment and stages of disease, were randomized to receive the following: an oncologist verbal recommendation to exercise (REC; n\u00a0=\u00a043) or REC plus a cancer-specific yoga DVD (REC + DVD; n\u00a0=\u00a047). Fatigue, vigor, and depression subscales of the Profile of Mood States, and physical activity levels (MET-min/week), exercise readiness, and self-efficacy were assessed at baseline, 4, and 8\u00a0weeks. Analyses controlled for age, time since diagnosis, and metastatic disease.","Over 8\u00a0weeks, women in REC + DVD used the DVD an average of twice per week. The REC + DVD group had greater reductions in fatigue (-\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0 vs. -\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), maintained exercise readiness (-\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 vs. -\u00a00.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and reported less of a decrease in physical activity (-\u00a0420\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03075 vs. -\u00a0427\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05060 MET-min/week, p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) compared to REC only.","A low-cost, easily distributed, and scalable yoga-based DVD could be a simple booster to an oncologist's advice that motivates breast cancer patients, even those with advanced disease and/or in treatment, to engage in self-care, e.g., exercise, to manage fatigue."
1150,22535636,Excess weight is a strong predictor of incident breast cancer (BC) and survivorship. A limited number of studies comparing strategies for promoting successful weight loss in women with remitted BC exist.CASTLE was a pilot study comparing the effectiveness/feasibility of in-person and telephonic behavioral-based lifestyle weight loss interventions in BC survivors.,"Fifty-two overweight/obese women (BMI\u2009=\u200925-45 kg/m(2)) with remitted BC (stages I-IIIa) who recently completed cancer treatment were assigned to either an in-person group (n\u2009=\u200924) or an individual telephone-based condition (n\u2009=\u200911). Both interventions focused on increasing physical activity and reducing caloric intake. The phase I intervention lasted 6 months. The in-person condition received 16 group-based sessions, and the telephone condition received intervention calls approximately weekly. Phase II lasted 6 months (e.g., months 6-12), and all participants received monthly intervention calls via telephone.","Participants were predominately Caucasian (80 %) with a mean age of 52.8 (8.0) years and BMI of 31.9 (5.4) kg/m(2). Mixed models ANOVAs showed significant within group weight loss after 6 months for both the in-person (-3.3 kg\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and the telephonic (-4.0 kg\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0, p\u2009=\u20090.01) conditions with no between group differences. During phase II, the in-person group demonstrated significant weight regain (1.3 kg\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7, p\u2009=\u20090.009).",Our pilot study findings demonstrated that telephone-based behavioral weight loss programs are effective and feasible in BC survivors and that telephonic programs may have advantages in promoting weight loss maintenance.
1151,11759309,To examine the effects of an acute bout of exercise on state anxiety in breast cancer survivors.,A two-group (high and low state anxiety) by two-time (pre- and postexercise) mixed factorial design.Exercise physiology lab at the University of Alberta.34 stage I or II breast cancer survivors ranging in age from 39-65 (X = 50.50; SD = 6.62).Participants completed the State Anxiety Inventory prior to and five minutes following an acute bout of exercise.State anxiety.,"A main effect resulted for group (p &lt; 0.01) and time showing that state anxiety significantly decreased from pre- to postexercise (p &lt; 0.03). Group by time interaction showed that state anxiety for the low state anxiety group did not change from pre- to postexercise (p &gt; 0.05); however, state anxiety significantly decreased in the high state anxiety group (p &lt; 0.03).","Acute exercise may be an effective intervention in reducing state anxiety in breast cancer survivors, especially those with high state anxiety.Oncology nurses should be aware that in addition to other traditional anxiolytic therapies (e.g., relaxation therapy) commonly prescribed, acute exercise is an effective method for reducing state anxiety in breast cancer survivors."
1152,11678487,"To examine whether diet intervention can promote increased vegetable and fruit intake, as reflected in increased plasma carotenoid and decreased plasma total homocysteine concentrations, in premenopausal women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, a precancerous condition.","Randomized controlled diet intervention study.Fifty-three free-living premenopausal women who had been diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, were randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 27) or a control (n = 26) group.Individualized dietary counseling to increase vegetable and fruit intake.Diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Plasma carotenoids and total homocysteine were measured at enrollment and at 6 months follow up.Associations between baseline plasma concentrations of carotenoids and homocysteine and influencing factors were examined with multiple regression analysis. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test for group by time effects in these plasma concentrations. Plasma carotenoids at baseline and 6 months in the study groups, and differences in homocysteine concentrations from baseline to 6 months, were compared with independent sample t tests.","Repeated measures analysis of variance showed significant group by time effects (P&lt;.01) in plasma carotenoid and homocysteine concentrations. In the intervention group, total plasma carotenoids increased by an average of 91%, from 2.04+/-0.13 (mean+/-standard error of the mean) to 3.90+/-0.56 micromol/L and plasma total homocysteine was reduced by 11%, from 9.01+/-0.40 to 8.10+/-0.44 micromol/L (P&lt;.003). Neither changed significantly in the control group.",Individualized dietary counseling can effectively promote increased vegetable and fruit intake in premenopausal women. This dietary pattern may reduce risk for cancer and other chronic diseases and also promote an improvement in folate status.
1153,9168185,"Although the incidence of precancerous conditions of the cervix has recently been increasing, prompt initial and long-term follow-up care can effectively reduce unnecessary morbidity and mortality. For example, the 4-year survival rates among those individuals at greatest risk for cervical cancer (i.e., minority women of low socioeconomic status) approach 95% with early detection. Women who present with advanced disease have a much poorer outlook (0%-39% survival). Yet, high-risk individuals are least likely to adhere to recommended diagnostic regimens.We tested the effectiveness of a brief telephone counseling intervention directed to low-income, inner-city women after they had received an abnormal Pap smear result. The women were counseled on the importance of having an initial and 6-month repeat follow-up diagnostic procedure (i.e., colposcopic examination of the cervix).","A randomized trial design was used to compare the effects on these women of telephone counseling with (n = 192) or without (n = 203) a booster counseling telephone call prior to the appointment for a repeat colposcopy 6 months later, with a telephone appointment confirmation/reminder call (n = 216) and with standard care (i.e., no telephone contact) (n = 217). The telephone counseling protocol probed for and addressed three psychologic barriers to adherence (i.e., attendance at appointment for colposcopy examination): 1) encoding/expectancy (e.g., did the patient understand her risk of developing cervical cancer?); 2) affective/emotional (e.g., was the woman worried about the condition and its consequences?); and 3) self-regulatory/practical (e.g., was the woman likely to forget medical appointments?). Logistic regression was used to analyze the effects of the intervention group and the type of psychologic barriers elicited on colposcopy adherence.","The results of logistic regression analysis (using those who received an appointment confirmation/reminder telephone call as the comparison group) revealed that telephone counseling produced significantly higher adherence rates to the initial colposcopy visit compared with telephone confirmation (300 [76%] of 395 women versus 147 [68%] of 216; odds ratio [OR] = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04-2.17). Additionally, standard care resulted in significantly lower adherence rates than did telephone confirmation (109 [50%] of 217 women versus 147 [68%] of 216; OR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.32-0.73). Regarding attendance at the 6-month repeat colposcopy appointments, the 80 patients who had received telephone counseling prior to the initial visit (and were recommended for follow-up colposcopy) were significantly more likely to adhere than were the 47 patients who had received telephone confirmation (49 [61%] of 80 women versus 17 [36.2%] of 47; OR = 2.70; 95% CI = 1.15-6.51). The 6-month adherence rates for patients in the telephone confirmation group and the standard care group (n = 30) were low and did not differ significantly (17 [36.2%] of 47 women versus nine [30.0%] of 30; OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.40-2.89). Forgetting medical appointments (OR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.19-0.51) and having scheduling conflicts (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.28-0.72) were also associated with lower rates of adherence.",The use of telephone counseling appears to be an effective strategy for enhancing initial and long-term adherence to a follow-up cervical diagnostic procedure in a traditionally underserved population. Patients who respond to a positive Pap test result with a particular profile of psychologic barriers may require more intensive and targeted counseling interventions.
1154,10083698,To evaluate opportunistic reminders in emergency departments (EDs) about cervical smears.,"Five EDs in Sydney in 1995-96 participated in a block-randomised control trial, whereby unscreened women at risk for cervical cancer who were seen as nonacute cases were allocated either to brief advice at the end of the ED consultation to return to their GP for a smear (intervention) or usual care (control). Blinded follow-up telephone interviews determined women's compliance four weeks later.","217 women at risk for cervical cancer presented, of whom 53 (23%) were overdue for a Pap smear (22 intervention group; 31 control group). At follow-up, no women in the intervention group had had a smear, although 3 (10%) in the control group had (p = 0.25).","Opportunities in EDs in NSW for opportunistic reminders are infrequent and, even if taken, are unlikely to encourage screening over and above usual care.General practice remains a more effective location for opportunistic recruitment, although interventions with hospitalised in-patients also show greater promise than reminders in EDs."
1155,21159483,Coaching patients to be more active in health encounters may improve communication with physicians but does not necessarily improve health outcomes. We explored this discrepancy by examining relationships between self-efficacy for communicating with physicians and pain control self-efficacy and subsequent pain severity among cancer patients participating in a coaching trial.,"We analyzed data from 244 English-speaking adults with various cancer types reporting significant pain, recruited from 49 oncology physicians' offices. Mixed model linear regression examined relationships between post-intervention communication self-efficacy and pain control self-efficacy and subsequent pain severity over 12 weeks.","Post-intervention pain control self-efficacy (but not communication self-efficacy) was significantly related to subsequent pain severity: a one standard deviation increase was associated with a 0.19 point decrease (95% confidence interval=-0.33, -0.04; p=0.01) in pain severity over time, approximately 25% of the effect size of the influence of post-intervention pain on subsequent pain.","Among cancer patients enrolled in a coaching trial, post-intervention pain control self-efficacy, but not communication self-efficacy, was significantly related to subsequent pain severity.Identifying behavioral mediators of cancer pain severity may lead to coaching interventions that are more effective in improving cancer pain control."

Of 456 eligible women, 156 refused participation, 300 were randomly assigned, 269 completed assigned interventions, and 260 completed the post-test 1 year later.One third of patients received nurse instruction stressing tactile skills (Mammacare group) (Mammatech Corporation, Gainesville, Florida); one third, traditional nurse instruction emphasizing technique (traditional group); and one third, no nurse instruction (control group). Half of each group received physician encouragement.","One year later, women in the Mammacare group found more lumps (mean, 57%; 95% CI, 54% to 60%) in manufactured breast models than did those in the traditional (mean, 47%; CI, 44% to 51%) and control (mean, 45%; CI, 42% to 48%) groups. Lump detection specificity was unaffected. Self-reported examination frequency rose in all groups, to 5.1 times per 6 months in the traditional group, 4.2 in the Mammacare group, and 3.9 in the control group. Physician encouragement did not improve sensitivity, specificity, or overall frequency. Women in the Mammacare group used more of seven examination techniques (4.9) than did those in the traditional (3.9) or control (3.2) groups (P less than 0.001). No group increased health care use or reported more overall worry about breast cancer.",Mammacare instruction resulted in more long-term improved lump detection and examination technique use than did traditional instruction or physician encouragement. Breast self-examination instruction should emphasize lump detection skills.
1158,7591492,"To compare two different formats of a brief, group psychoeducational program for cancer patients; a standard format of six weekly two-hour sessions or a &quot;weekend intensive,&quot; involving the same content and contact time compressed into two days.",Cancer patients were randomly assigned to either the standard weekly intervention (n = 77) or the weekend program (n = 79). Two assessment measures were used: Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Functional Living Index for Cancer (FLIC). Assessments were made before and after each intervention and at a nineteen-week follow-up.,"While the two formats were found to be equivalent in their overall effects on mood and quality of life, there were some differences. There was a sudden, large improvement in mood by the end of the weekend version of the course (2-day time point) but this did not persist, and by the six-week point and again at nineteen-weeks, mood improvement was the same for both groups. Quality of life improvement seemed to be marginally greater with the six-weekly sessions (reaching statistical significance at the 6-week point).",The two formats produced similar improvements in both mood and quality of life. We discuss the need for further studies to find optimal ways of presenting such help for different patient groups.

Subgroup analysis showed no intervention effect in intended uptake between women at higher and lower risk of cervical cancer (p=0.59).","Providing women with evidence based information on the risks, uncertainties, and the benefits of screening, is likely to deter some, but not differentially those at higher risk."
1168,29952241,"Women with breast cancer are often prescribed aromatase inhibitors, which can cause rapid loss of bone mass leading to significant potential for morbidity. Vibration training has been shown to be helpful in reducing bone turnover in postmenopausal women without cancer.To examine the effect of vibration stimulus on markers of bone turnover in breast cancer patients receiving aromatase inhibitors.","Thirty-one breast cancer survivors undergoing treatment with aromatase inhibitors were randomized to vibration stimulus (n = 14) or usual care control (n = 17). Low-frequency and low-magnitude vibration stimulus (27-32 Hz, 0.3 g) was delivered in supervised sessions via standing on a vibration platform for 20 minutes, 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was blood markers of bone resorption (serum N-telopeptide X/creatine) and formation (serum type 1 procollagen N-terminal propeptide; P1NP). Other study outcomes body composition as well as measures of physical functioning. Outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values as well as time on aromatase inhibitors.","On average, participants were 61.5 years old and overweight (ie, body mass index = 28.5 kg/m). Following vibration training, there was no significant difference between groups for bone resorption (adjusted group difference 0.5, P = .929) or formation (adjusted group difference 5.3, P = .286). There were also no changes in any measure of physical functioning body composition.","Short-term low-magnitude vibration stimulus does not appear to be useful for reducing markers of bone turnover secondary to aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer patients; nor is it useful in improving physical function or symptoms. However, further investigations with larger samples and higher doses of vibration are warranted."
1169,22394647,"Pre-visit education which helps counselees to prepare for their first visit for breast cancer genetic counseling might enhance information recall and needs fulfilment. This study assessed the effects of a pre-visit website with tailored information and question prompt sheet (QPS), named E-info geneca.","A total of 197 counselees were randomized to receive usual care (UC) or UC plus E-info geneca. All counselees completed a pre- and post-visit questionnaire and visits were videotaped. We studied effects on counselees' information recall, knowledge about breast cancer and heredity, fulfillment of needs, risk perception alignment, anxiety and perceived personal control, using multilevel regression analyses.","Intent-to-treat analysis showed that counselees in the intervention group (n = 103) had higher levels of recall of information from the consultation (\u03b2 = .32; confidence interval (CI): .04 to .60; P = .02; d = .17) and post-visit knowledge of breast cancer and heredity (\u03b2 = .30; CI: .03 to .57; P = .03) than counselees in the UC group (n = 94). Also, intervention group counselees reported better fulfilment of information needs (\u03b2 = .31; CI: .03 to .60; P = .03). The effects of the intervention were strongest for those counselees who did not receive an indication for DNA testing. Their recall scores showed a larger increase (\u03b2 = .95; CI: .32 to 1.59; P = .003; d = .30) and their anxiety levels dropped more in the intervention compared to the UC group (\u03b2 = -.60; CI: -1.12 to -.09; P = .02). No intervention effects were found after the first visit on risk perception alignment or perceived personal control.","This study shows that pre-counseling education, using tailored information technology, leads to more effective first visits for breast cancer genetic counseling, in particular for counselees who received no indication for DNA testing and, therefore, had no indication for a second visit. Future study should focus on the effects of a pre-visit website on the outcomes after a complete series of visits."
1170,27295811,Therapeutic approaches that will improve the reduced cardiopulmonary functions of breast cancer (BC) survivors are of optimal importance. The effects of aerobic exercise on health-related outcomes of BC survivors have been reported while there is a dearth of information on the effects of combined aerobic and stretching exercises on cardiopulmonary parameters of female BC survivors.This study investigated the effects of combined aerobic and stretching exercises on cardiopulmonary functions of premenopausal and postmenopausal Breast cancer (BC) survivors.,Fifty-four eligible BC survivors participated in the study but four-eight completed it. They were randomly' assigned to groups A and B and each group had two subgroups; subgroup 1 (premenopausal) and subgroup 2 (postmenopausal). Group A underwent combined aerobic exercise using treadmill and stretching exercises for 12 weeks while Group B was the control group.,"Significant changes were observed in the cardiovascular parameters of participants in Groups A,,,,, (Resting systolic blood pressure (A1:p = 0.01*; A2: p = 0.01*), Resting diastolic blood pressure (A1: p = 0.01*; A2: p = 0.004*), Resting rate pressure product (A1: p 0.001*; A2: p = 0.02*). Significant changes were also observed in the pulmonary parameters of participants of Groups A(1&amp;2) (Arterioxyhaemoglobin saturation (A,:p = 0.001*; A2:p = 0.02*), Forced vital capacity (A1:p = 0.13; A2: p = 0.05*), maximal oxygen uptake (A1:p = 0.03*; A2: p = 0.15).",Combined aerobic and stretching exercises brought about significant therapeutic effects on selected cardiopulmonary parameters in female BC survivors.
1171,16442463,"The importance of psychosocial counselling after a diagnosis of cancer has been acknowledged and many intervention studies have been carried out, with the aim to find out which types of intervention are most effective in enhancing quality of life in cancer patients. A factor which could be part of effective counselling could be the time of offering psychosocial counselling. The aim of this study was to research the effect of time of enrolment in a psychosocial group intervention on psychosocial adjustment.","In the present study, 67 women with early stage breast cancer were randomised in a psychosocial group intervention program starting within 4 months after surgery or in the same intervention program starting at least 3 months later.","The main conclusion of this study is that women who started with their intervention early were less distressed at 6 months follow-up than women who were in the delayed condition. Medical and demographic variables were predictive for some psychosocial adjustment indicators, but were not associated with time of enrolment. Regardless of time of enrolment, women improved in distress, body image and recreational activities, but showed a decrease in social interaction.","Though results are limited, based on these results we suggest that psychosocial counselling should be offered as soon after diagnosis or surgery for breast cancer.Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer should be able to start with psychological counselling soon after being diagnosed, to prevent them from becoming distressed at long term."
1172,8594266,"To examine the effect of supplementation with vitamin E (alpha tocopherol), beta carotene, or both on the incidence of angina pectoris in men without known previous coronary heart disease.","Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.Participants in the Alpha Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (N=29133) were male smokers aged 50 through 69 years who were living in southern and western Finland. Of these men, 22269 were considered free of coronary heart disease at baseline and were followed up for the incidence of angina pectoris.Participants were randomized to receive 50 mg/d of alpha tocopherol, 20 mg/d of beta carotene, both, or placebo in a 2x2 design.An incident case was defined as the first occurrence of typical angina pectoris identified in administering the annually repeated World Health Organization (Rose) Chest Pain Questionnaire.","During a median follow-up time of 4.7 years (96427 person-years), 1983 new cases of angina pectoris were detected. Comparing alpha tocopherol-supplemented subjects with non-alpha tocopherol-supplemented subjects showed a relative risk (RR) of angina pectoris incidence of 0.91 (95% confidence interval[CI], 0.83 to 0.99; P=.04). The RR for incidence of angina pectoris for the beta carotene- supplemented subjects compared with those not receiving beta carotene was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.16; P=.19). Compared with those receiving placebo, the RRs for incidence of angina pectoris were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.10) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.09) in the alpha tocopherol and alpha tocopherol plus beta carotene groups, respectively, and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.27) in the beta carotene group (P=.06). Baseline dietary intakes and serum levels of alpha tocopherol and beta carotene did not predict incidence of angina pectoris.",Supplementation with alpha tocopherol was associated with only a minor decrease in the incidence of angina pectoris. Beta carotene had no preventive effect and was associated with a slight increase of angina.
1173,23725233,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an important advance directive (AD) topic in patients with progressive cancer; however such discussions are challenging.This study investigates whether video educational information about CPR engenders broader advance care planning (ACP) discourse.,Patients with progressive pancreas or hepatobiliary cancer were randomized to an educational CPR video or a similar CPR narrative. The primary end-point was the difference in ACP documentation one month posttest between arms. Secondary end-points included study impressions; pre- and post-intervention knowledge of and preferences for CPR and mechanical ventilation; and longitudinal patient outcomes.,"Fifty-six subjects were consented and analyzed. Rates of ACP documentation (either formal ADs or documented discussions) were 40% in the video arm (12/30) compared to 15% in the narrative arm (4/26), OR=3.6 [95% CI: 0.9-18.0], p=0.07. Post-intervention knowledge was higher in both arms. Posttest, preferences for CPR had changed in the video arm but not in the narrative arm. Preferences regarding mechanical ventilation did not change in either arm. The majority of subjects in both arms reported the information as helpful and comfortable to discuss, and they recommended it to others. More deaths occurred in the video arm compared to the narrative arm, and more subjects died in hospice settings in the video arm.","This pilot randomized trial addressing downstream ACP effects of video versus narrative decision tools demonstrated a trend towards more ACP documentation in video subjects. This trend, as well as other video effects, is the subject of ongoing study."
1174,21742946,"On the basis of hypothesized protective effect, we examined the effect of soy foods on estrogens in nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) and serum, possible indicators of breast cancer risk.","In a crossover design, we randomized 96 women who produced 10 \u03bcL or more NAF to a high- or low-soy diet for 6 months. During the high-soy diet, participants consumed 2 soy servings of soy milk, tofu, or soy nuts (\u223c50 mg of isoflavones per day); during the low-soy diet, they maintained their usual diet. Six NAF samples were obtained using a FirstCyte aspirator. Estradiol (E(2)) and estrone sulfate (E(1)S) were assessed in NAF and estrone (E(1)) in serum only, using highly sensitive radioimmunoassays. Mixed-effects regression models accounting for repeated measures and left-censoring limits were applied.","Mean E(2) and E(1)S were lower during the high-soy than the low-soy diet (113 vs. 313 pg/mL and 46 vs. 68 ng/mL, respectively) without reaching significance (P = 0.07); the interaction between group and diet was not significant. There was no effect of the soy treatment on serum levels of E(2) (P = 0.76), E(1) (P = 0.86), or E(1)S (P = 0.56). Within individuals, NAF and serum levels of E(2) (r(s) = 0.37; P &lt; 0.001) but not of E(1)S (r(s) = 0.004; P = 0.97) were correlated. E(2) and E(1)S in NAF and serum were strongly associated (r(s) = 0.78 and r(s) = 0.48; P &lt; 0.001).",Soy foods in amounts consumed by Asians did not significantly modify estrogen levels in NAF and serum.The trend toward lower estrogen levels in NAF during the high-soy diet counters concerns about adverse effects of soy foods on breast cancer risk.
1175,17573321,To test the effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in women newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.,"Randomized clinical trial.Two National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers in metropolitan areas.66 women with stage I-III breast cancer beginning adjuvant chemotherapy.Participants were randomized to aerobic or resistance exercise and usual care. At the beginning of chemotherapy and at six months, patients completed exercise testing and BMD assessment of the lumbar spine by dual energy x-ray absorptionetry.BMD, aerobic capacity, and muscle strength.","The average decline in BMD was -6.23% for usual care, -4.92% for resistance exercise, and -0.76% for aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise preserved BMD significantly better compared to usual care. Premenopausal women demonstrated significantly greater declines in BMD than postmenopausal women. Aerobic capacity increased by almost 25% for women in the aerobic exercise group and 4% for resistance exercise. Participants in the usual care group showed a 10% decline in aerobic capacity.",The data suggest that weight-bearing aerobic exercise attenuates declines in BMD and that aerobic and resistance exercise improve aerobic capacity and muscle strength at a time when women generally show marked declines in functional ability.Exercise may prevent or at least minimize bone loss observed during chemotherapy and may prevent or delay the long-term effects of osteoporosis.
1176,18760888,To evaluate an entertainment-based patient decision aid for prostate cancer screening among patients with low or high health literacy.,"Male primary care patients from two clinical sites, one characterized as serving patients with low health literacy (n=149) and the second as serving patients with high health literacy (n=301), were randomized to receive an entertainment-based decision aid for prostate cancer screening or an audiobooklet-control aid with the same learner content but without the entertainment features. Postintervention and 2-week follow-up assessments were conducted.","Patients at the low-literacy site were more engaged with the entertainment-based aid than patients at the high-literacy site. Overall, knowledge improved for all patients. Among patients at the low-literacy site, the entertainment-based aid was associated with lower decisional conflict and greater self-advocacy (i.e., mastering and obtaining information about screening) when compared to patients given the audiobooklet. No differences between the aids were observed for patients at the high-literacy site.","Entertainment education may be an effective strategy for promoting informed decision making about prostate cancer screening among patients with lower health literacy.As barriers to implementing computer-based patient decision support programs decrease, alternative models for delivering these programs should be explored."
1177,15694064,"To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two complementary interventions, using familial breast cancer as a model condition. The primary care intervention consisted of providing computerised referral guidelines and related education to GPs. The nurse counsellor intervention evaluated genetic nurses as substitutes for specialist geneticists in the initial assessment and management of referred patients.","The computerised referral guidelines study was a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) with general practices randomised to intervention or control groups. The nurse counsellor intervention was tested in two concurrent RCTs conducted in separate UK health service locations, using predetermined definitions of equivalence.The computerised referral guidelines trial took place in general practices in Scotland from November 2000 to June 2001. The nurse counsellor intervention took place in a regional genetics clinic in Scotland, and in two health authorities in Wales served by a single genetics service during 2001.The computerised referral guidelines study involved GPs and referred patients. Both nurse counsellor intervention trials included women referred for the first time, aged 18 years or over and whose main concern was family history of breast cancer.The software system was developed with GPs, presenting cancer genetic referral guidelines in a checklist approach. Intervention GPs were invited to postgraduate update education sessions, and both intervention and control practices received paper-based guidelines. The intervention period was November 2000 to June 2001. For the nurse counsellor trial, trial 1 ran outpatient sessions with the same appointment length as the standard service offered by geneticists, but the nurse counsellor saw new patients at the first appointment and referred back to the GP or on to a clinical geneticist according to locally developed protocol, under the supervision of a consultant geneticist. The control intervention was the current service, which comprised an initial and a follow-up appointment with a clinical geneticist. In trial 2, a nurse counsellor ran outpatient sessions with the same appointment length as the new consultant-based cancer genetics service and new patients were seen at the first appointment and referred as in trial 1. The control intervention was a new service, and comprised collection of family history by telephone followed by a consultation with a clinical assistant or a specialist registrar, supervised by a consultant. The intervention was implemented between 1998 and 2001.In the software system trial, the primary outcome was GPs' confidence in their management of patients with concerns about family history of breast cancer. For the nurse counsellor trial, the primary outcome was patient anxiety, measured using standard scales.","In the software system trial, 57 practices (230 GPs) were randomised to the intervention group and 29 (116 GPs) to the control group. No statistically significant differences were detected in GPs' confidence or any other outcomes. Fewer than half of the intervention GPs were aware of the software, and only 22 reported using it in practice. The estimated total cost was GBP3.12 per CD-ROM distributed (2001 prices). For the two arms of the nurse counsellor trial, 289 patients (193 intervention, 96 control) and 297 patients (197 intervention and 100 control) consented, were randomised, returned a baseline questionnaire and attended the clinic for trials 1 and 2 respectively. The analysis in both cases suggested equivalence in all anxiety scores, and no statistically significant differences were detected in other outcomes in either trial. A cost-minimisation analysis suggested that the cost per counselling episode was GBP10.23 lower in intervention arm than in the control arm and GBP10.89 higher in the intervention arm than in the control arm (2001 prices) for trials 1 and 2, respectively. Taking the trials together, the costs were sensitive to the grades of doctors and the time spent in consultant supervision of the nurse counsellor, but they were only slightly affected by the grade of nurse counsellor, the selected discount rate and the lifespan of equipment.","Computer-based systems in the primary care intervention cannot be recommended for widespread use without further evaluation and testing in real practice settings. Genetic nurse counsellors may be a cost-effective alternative to assessment by doctors. This trial does not provide definitive evidence that the general policy of employing genetics nurse counsellors is sound, as it was based on only three individuals. Future evaluations of computer-based decision support systems for primary care must first address their efficacy under ideal conditions, identify barriers to the use of such systems in practice, and provide evidence of the impact of the policy of such systems in routine practice. The nurse counsellor trial should be replicated in other settings to provide reassurance of the generalisability of the intervention and other models of nurse-based assessment, such as in outreach clinics, should be developed and evaluated. The design of future evaluations of professional substitution should also address issues such as the effect of different levels of training and experience of nurse counsellors, and learning effects."
1178,29310613,"Informal caregivers provide extended support to people with cancer but they receive little support from the health care system to assist them in their caring role. The aim of this single-blind, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial was to test the efficacy of a telephone outcall program to reduce caregiver burden and unmet needs, and improve psychological well-being among cancer caregivers, as well as evaluating the potential impact on patient outcomes.","Cancer patient/caregiver dyads (N\u2009=\u2009216) were randomised to a telephone outcall program (n\u2009=\u2009108) or attention control group (n\u2009=\u2009108). The primary outcome was self-reported caregiver burden. Secondary endpoints included depressive symptoms, unmet needs, self-esteem, self-empowerment, and health literacy. Data were collected at baseline and at both 1 and 6 months post-intervention. An intention to treat analysis was performed.","The intervention had no effect on the primary outcome (caregiver burden), but reduced the number of caregiver unmet needs (intervention group baseline, mean\u2009=\u20092.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.91-3.54]; intervention group 1\u00a0month post intervention, mean\u2009=\u20090.85, 95%CI [0.42-1.44]; control group baseline, mean\u2009=\u20091.30 95%CI [0.80-1.94], control group 1\u00a0month post intervention, mean\u2009=\u20091.02 95%CI [0.52-1.69]; p\u2009=\u20090.023). For caregivers at risk for depression, the intervention had a significant effect on caregivers' confidence in having sufficient information to manage their health (p\u2009=\u20090.040). No effects were found for patients' depressive symptoms, unmet needs, self-empowerment, and other health literacy domains.","While caregiver burden was not reduced, the outcall program was effective in reducing unmet needs in caregivers. Provision of cancer information and support via a telephone service may represent a feasible approach to reducing unmet needs among cancer caregiver populations."
1179,25232809,"Observational studies suggest a role for dietary nutrients such as vitamin E and selenium in cataract prevention.

A total of 11,267 SELECT participants from 128 SELECT sites participated in the SELECT Eye Endpoints ancillary study.Individual supplements of selenium (200 \u03bcg per day from L-selenomethionine) and vitamin E (400 IU per day of all rac-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate).Incident cataract was defined as a lens opacity, age related in origin, and responsible for a reduction in best-corrected visual acuity to 20/30 or worse based on self-reports confirmed by medical record review. Cataract extraction was defined as the surgical removal of an incident cataract.","During a mean (SD) of 5.6 (1.2) years of treatment and follow-up, 389 cases of cataract were documented. There were 185 cataracts in the selenium group and 204 in the no selenium group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95 % CI, 0.75-1.11; P =\u2009.37). For vitamin E, there were 197 cases in the treated group and 192 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95 % CI, 0.84-1.25; P =\u2009.81). Similar results were observed for cataract extraction.",These data from a large cohort of apparently healthy men indicate that long-term daily supplementation with selenium and/or vitamin E is unlikely to have a large beneficial effect on age-related cataract.
1180,9243585,To test the hypothesis that women participating in a walking exercise program during radiation therapy treatment for breast cancer would demonstrate more adaptive responses as evidenced by higher levels of physical functioning and lower levels of symptom intensity than women who did not participate.,"Experimental, two-group pretest, post-test.Two university teaching hospital outpatient radiation therapy departments.46 women beginning a six-week program of radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer.Following random assignment, subjects in the exercise group maintained an individualized, self-paced, home-based walking exercise program throughout treatment. The control group received usual care. Dependent variables were measured prior to and at the end of radiation therapy. In addition, symptoms were assessed at the end of three weeks of treatment.Participation in the walking exercise program, physical functioning fatigue, emotional distress, and difficulty sleeping.","Hypothesis testing by multivariate analysis of covariance, with pretest scores as covariates, indicated significant differences between groups on outcome measures (p &lt; 0.001). The exercise group scored significantly higher than the usual care group on physical functioning (p = 0.003) and symptom intensity, particularly fatigue, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. Fatigue was the most frequent and intense subjective symptom reported.","A self-paced, home-based walking exercise program can help manage symptoms and improve physical functioning during radiation therapy.Nurse-prescribed and -monitored exercise is an effective, convenient, and low-cost self-care activity that reduces symptoms and facilitates adaptation to breast cancer diagnosis and treatment."
1181,20479295,To evaluate the robustness of an appearance-focused intervention to prevent skin cancer in individuals reporting seasonal affective disorder (SAD) symptoms and pathological tanning motives.,"Randomized, controlled clinical trial.College campus.Four hundred thirty adult female indoor tanners (200 in the intervention group and 230 control participants).A booklet discussing the history of tanning, current tanning norms, UV radiation's effects on skin, recommendations for indoor tanning use focusing on abstinence and harm reduction recommendations, and information on healthier, appearance-enhancing alternatives to tanning.Self-reported attitudes, intentions, and tanning behaviors; pathological tanning motives assessed by a questionnaire developed for this study; and SAD symptoms assessed by the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire.","Two of the 4 pathological tanning scales, opiatelike reactions to tanning and dissatisfaction with natural skin tone, were significant moderators demonstrating stronger treatment effects for individuals scoring higher on these scales. Treatment effects were equivalently positive (ie, no significant moderator effects) for all levels of SAD symptoms and all levels of the other 2 pathological tanning motive scales (ie, perceiving tanning as a problem and tolerance to the effects of tanning).","The appearance-focused skin cancer prevention intervention is robust enough to reduce indoor tanning among tanners who exhibit SAD symptoms or pathological tanning motives. Tailored interventions may address individuals' motivations for tanning and their relation to maladaptive behavior, such as dissatisfaction with appearance or the need for relaxation because of anxiety."
1182,12925545,"(1) To evaluate preliminary effects of a computerized support system on congruence between patients' reported symptoms and preferences and those addressed in the patient consultation and (2) to investigate the system's ease of use, time requirements, and patient satisfaction.","Fifty-two patients were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions.Cancer patients scheduled for an outpatient visit used the system on a tablet computer to report their symptoms and preferences prior to their consultation. This information was processed, printed, and provided to the patient and clinician in the subsequent consultation in the experimental group but not in the control group.","While patients in both groups were equivalent at baseline in symptom characteristics, there was significantly greater congruence between patients' reported symptoms and those addressed by their clinicians in the experimental group. The system scored high on ease of use. There were no significant group differences in patient satisfaction.",This study provided beginning evidence that eliciting patients' symptoms and preferences and providing clinicians with this information prior to consultation can be an effective and feasible strategy to improve patient-centered care.
1183,30168356,The aim of present study was to study the effect of osteopathic manipulation on pain relief and quality of life improvement in hospitalized oncology geriatric patients.,"A nonrandomized controlled clinical trial was performed in the Oncology Rehabilitation Unit, Milan, Italy, from September 2015 to March 2016. Twenty-three older cancer patients were enrolled and allocated in 2 experimental groups: the study group (OMT group, N = 12) underwent osteopathic manipulative treatment in addition to physiotherapy, and the control group (PT group, N = 12) underwent only physiotherapy. At enrollment (T0), 24 recruited oncology patients completed the sociodemographic forms and were evaluated for pain intensity and quality of life by an external examiner. All patients were revaluated every week (T1, T2, T3, and T4) for pain intensity and at the end of the study treatment (T4) for quality of life. A standard level of significance was set at \u03b1 &lt; .05.","The 2 groups did not significantly differ in age ( P = .682), body mass index ( P = .413), or gender ( P = 1). The osteopathic manipulative treatment added to physiotherapy produced a significant reduction in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores both at T2 ( P = .004) and T4 ( P = .002). The difference in quality of life improvements between T0 and T4 was not statistically significant. NRS improved in the PT group at T4. Between-group analysis of NRS and quality of life with the Mann-Whitney test did not show any significant difference between the 2 treatments.",Our study showed a significant improvement in pain relief and a nonsignificant improvement in quality of life in hospitalized geriatric oncology patients during osteopathic manipulative treatment.
1184,27161493,The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a combined aerobic and strength program on physiological and psychological parameters in female breast cancer survivors.,"Randomised controlled trial.20 patients (age: 45.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7\u00a0yrs) surgically treated for breast cancer that had completed all cancer therapies at least 6 months before and with no contraindications to physical activity, were recruited and randomly assigned to an intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a010). Intervention group patients attend to a 24-week combined aerobic and strength training program. Physiological (i.e. VO2max, bioelectrical impedance test, maximal strength of principal muscular groups) and psychological (i.e. functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue: FACIT-F) parameters were assessed at baseline and after 24 weeks.","After 24 weeks the intervention group showed significant improvement in VO2max (38.8%), strength of upper and lower limbs (ranging from 13 to 60%) and decrease in fat mass percentage (-6.3%). The FACIT-F showed significant increase in all of the three scores that can be derived (FACIT-F Trial outcome: 13%; FACT-G total score: 18%; FACIT-F total score: 15%) showing patient's quality of life (QOL) improvement. No significant change in all the parameters was found for the control group.",These results show the positive effects of a combined aerobic and strength training program on breast cancer survivors and underline the importance of the early inclusion of structured physical activity in the rehabilitation protocol.
1185,10550090,To compare the use and effect of a computer based information system for cancer patients that is personalised using each patient's medical record with a system providing only general information and with information provided in booklets.,"Randomised trial with three groups. Data collected at start of radiotherapy, one week later (when information provided), three weeks later, and three months later.525 patients started radical radiotherapy; 438 completed follow up.Two groups were offered information via computer (personalised or general information, or both) with open access to computer thereafter; the third group was offered a selection of information booklets.","Patients' views and preferences, use of computer and information, and psychological status; doctors' perceptions; cost of interventions.More patients offered the personalised information said that they had learnt something new, thought the information was relevant, used the computer again, and showed their computer printouts to others. There were no major differences in doctors' perceptions of patients. More of the general computer group were anxious at three months. With an electronic patient record system, in the long run the personalised information system would cost no more than the general system. Full access to booklets cost twice as much as the general system.",Patients preferred computer systems that provided information from their medical records to systems that just provided general information. This has implications for the design and implementation of electronic patient record systems and reliance on general sources of patient information.
1186,25617154,Fatigue is an important problem in paediatric cancer patients and yoga may be an effective intervention. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility of individualized yoga for hospitalized children receiving intensive chemotherapy.,"We included English-speaking children and adolescents aged 7-18 years receiving intensive chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Yoga was conducted three times weekly for three weeks. The primary outcome was feasibility, defined as ability to deliver at least 60% of planned sessions. Secondary outcomes were parent-reported Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, Fatigue Scale-Parent, PedsQL Generic Core Scales and PedsQL Acute Cancer Module.","Between January and October 2013, 11 patients were enrolled. Median age was 14.0 (range 7.7-16.4) years and 6 (55%) were boys. Yoga was feasible with 10/11 participants meeting the threshold for feasibility. The median number of yoga sessions was 9 (range 3-13). No adverse events were attributed to yoga. Mean\u00b1standard deviation for the day 21 proxy-reported PedsQL general fatigue scores was 55.6\u00b115.5. Qualitative comments suggested design changes for future yoga studies.",Individualized yoga is feasible for inpatient children receiving intensive chemotherapy. Future work will include development and conduct of a randomized trial for fatigue amelioration.
1187,11570022,"To test the effectiveness of interventions intended to increase rates of regular breast cancer screening, according to recommended guidelines.","A randomized controlled trial of 2 outreach interventions (a mail reminder and a telephone reminder plus appointment scheduling) compared with a routine publicity campaign to encourage continued participation in mammography screening.Participants were 1908 women aged 50 to 75 years continuously enrolled in a large group-model HMO during the study who underwent a bilateral mammogram during the first quarter of 1994 and no subsequent mammogram during the next 18 to 21 months. Data were obtained from health plan administrative data files supplemented by medical chart review. Women were randomly assigned to receive (1) a mail reminder, (2) a telephone reminder, or (3) routine publicity on mammography for all women. The outcome measure was a mammogram received after the intervention period and within 2 years of the initial mammogram date.",Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses showed that participation was significantly higher for women contacted by telephone than through routine publicity. Mail reminders were no more effective than a routine publicity campaign. Primary care physician and gynecologist visits increased the likelihood of a subsequent mammogram for women in all intervention groups.,"Telephone contact by regular health plan staff was more successful than publicity in encouraging continued participation in mammography screening in women enrolled in a group-model managed health care plan. Because mailings did not influence participation in mammography screening, health plans should be cautious about investing in member mailings without first evaluating their effectiveness in the context of existing outreach efforts."
1188,23181756,This pilot study aimed to test the acceptability and short-term effectiveness of a telephone-delivered multiple health behaviour change intervention for relatives of colorectal cancer survivors.,"A community-based sample of 22 first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer survivors were recruited via a media release. Data were collected at baseline and at six weeks (post-intervention). Outcome measures included health behaviours (physical activity, television viewing, diet, alcohol, body mass index, waist circumference and smoking), health-related quality of life (Short Form-36) and perceived colorectal cancer risk. Intervention satisfaction levels were also measured. The intervention included six telephone health coaching sessions, a participant handbook and a pedometer. It focused on behavioural risk factors for colorectal cancer [physical activity, diet (red and processed meat consumption, fruit and vegetable intake), alcohol, weight management and smoking], and colorectal cancer risk.","From baseline to six weeks, improvements were observed for minutes moderate-vigorous physical activity (150.7 minutes), processed meat intake (-1.2 serves/week), vegetable intake (1 serve/day), alcohol intake (-0.4 standard drinks/day), body mass index (-1.4 kg/m2), and waist circumference (-5.1 cm). Improvements were also observed for physical (3.3) and mental (4.4) health-related quality of life. Further, compared with baseline, participants were more likely to meet Australian recommendations post-intervention for: moderate-vigorous physical activity (27.3 vs 59.1%); fruit intake (68.2 vs 81.8%); vegetable intake (4.6 vs 18.2%); alcohol consumption (59.1 vs 72.7%); body mass index (31.8 vs 45.5%) and waist circumference (18.2 vs 27.3%). At six weeks participants were more likely to believe a diagnosis of CRC was related to family history, and there was a decrease in their perceived risk of developing CRC in their lifetime following participation in CanPrevent. The intervention retention rate was 100%, participants reported that it was highly acceptable and they would recommend it to others at risk of colorectal cancer.",Positive behaviour change achieved through this intervention approach has the potential to impact on the progression of CRC and other cancers or chronic diseases. A large scale randomised controlled trial is required to confirm the positive results of this acceptability and short-term effectiveness study.

There was increased dependence on others in ADL after 18 months in both groups, but it was more pronounced in the control group. Furthermore, a clear trend was observed in the data with regard to coping patterns, the control group using more coping strategies such as 'Helplessness/hopelessness' (P= 0.057), 'Anxious preoccupation' (P = 0.085) and 'Fatalistic' (P= 0.073) when being compared to the study group.","No apparent effects on ADL were found from the rehabilitation programme, although there was a tendency of reduction of maladaptive coping patterns in the study group. This initial study may provide the rationale and basis for a randomized controlled trial."
1190,27601354,The well-being of breast cancer patients and reporting of adverse events require close monitoring. Mobile apps allow continuous recording of disease- and medication-related symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy.The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a mobile app on patient-reported daily functional activity in a supervised and unsupervised setting.,"We conducted a randomized controlled study of 139 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Patient status was self-measured using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unsupervised group that used a mobile app to record data, or a supervised group that used the app and reviewed data with a physician. Primary outcome variables were change in daily functional activity and symptoms over three outpatient visits.","Functional activity scores declined in all groups from the first to second visit. However, from the second to third visit, only the supervised group improved, whereas the others continued to decline. Overall, the supervised group showed no significant difference from the first (median 90.85, IQR 30.67) to third visit (median 84.76, IQR 18.29, P=.72). Both app-using groups reported more distinct adverse events in the app than in the questionnaire (supervised: n=1033 vs n=656; unsupervised: n=852 vs n=823), although the unsupervised group reported more symptoms overall (n=4808) in the app than the supervised group (n=4463).","The mobile app was associated with stabilized daily functional activity when used under collaborative review. App-using participants could more frequently report adverse events, and those under supervision made fewer and more precise entries than unsupervised participants. Our findings suggest that patient well-being and awareness of chemotherapy adverse effects can be improved by using a mobile app in collaboration with the treating physician."
1191,16722953,"This paper reports a study testing the effect of music on power, pain, depression and disability, and comparing the effects of researcher-provided music (standard music) with subject-preferred music (patterning music).Chronic non-malignant pain is characterized by pain that persists in spite of traditional interventions. Previous studies have found music to be effective in decreasing pain and anxiety related to postoperative, procedural and cancer pain. However, the effect of music on power, pain, depression, and disability in working age adults with chronic non-malignant pain has not been investigated.","A randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out with a convenience sample of 60 African American and Caucasian people aged 21-65 years with chronic non-malignant pain. They were randomly assigned to a standard music group (n = 22), patterning music group (n = 18) or control group (n = 20). Pain was measured with the McGill Pain Questionnaire short form; depression was measured with the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale; disability was measured with the Pain Disability Index; and power was measured with the Power as Knowing Participation in Change Tool (version II).","The music groups had more power and less pain, depression and disability than the control group, but there were no statistically significant differences between the two music interventions. The model predicting both a direct and indirect effect for music was supported.","Nurses can teach patients how to use music to enhance the effects of analgesics, decrease pain, depression and disability, and promote feelings of power."

The individual characteristics explored were education, sources for information, and intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity.","Using repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance, findings indicated that there were no significant moderator effects for intrinsic religiosity on any of the outcomes. Lower level of education was a significant moderator for improvement in cancer knowledge. For the outcome of patient-provider communication, fewer sources for cancer information was a significant moderator for the amount told the patient by the nurse and other staff. Less extrinsic religiosity was a significant moderator for three areas of patient provider communication. The three areas are the amount (a) the physician tells the patient; (b) the patient helps with planning treatment; and (c) the patient tells the physician.","Testing for moderator effects provides important information regarding beneficiaries of interventions. In the current study, men's levels of education, amount of sources for information, and extrinsic religiosity influenced the efficacy of the Uncertainty Management Intervention on important outcomes."

Five-year follow-up of routine visits was documented in case report forms.Safety was assessed by measuring adverse events, body temperature during chemotherapy, and probability of relapse or metastasis in a 5-year follow-up. During chemotherapy, the neutrophil count and quality of life according to EORTC QLQ-C30 were assessed.","The two patient groups receiving different complementary mistletoe treatments were integrated into one mistletoe group for this safety analysis. Patients in the mistletoe group did not develop more fever symptoms than patients in the control group (two short-term events in each group). No significant differences in probability of relapse or metastasis were measured between the groups (p\u2009=\u20090.7637). The mistletoe group showed a trend toward less neutropenia (p\u2009=\u20090.178) and improved pain and appetite loss scores (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001 and p\u2009=\u20090.047, respectively) while having positive, but not significant, impact on other EORTC QLQ-C30 scores.","Mistletoe extracts were safe in this clinical study. Neither did subcutaneous injections induce fever, nor did they influence the frequency of relapse and metastasis within 5 years. This result suggests that mistletoe extracts had no adverse interactions with the anticancer agents used in this study. Furthermore, certain side effects of chemotherapy decreased under this complementary treatment in breast cancer patients."

Additional research is needed to understand who benefited most from the intervention.This nurse-directed intervention resulted in improved mental health for patients; however, physical subscales were not changed. Further work is needed to determine why depression and mental health were affected yet physical health and symptoms did not differ between groups. Results support the important role of nurses in addressing mental health issues in patients and families experiencing cancer."

Eighteen women with a history of breast cancer related lymphoedema were recruited. Participants received two intervention sessions (randomized order) with one week apart. Interventions were a 50min conventional aquatic intervention or a 50min modified Ai Chi. Arm volume was measured as the difference between affected and unaffected arm; bio-impedance was measured as an index of extracellular fluid; satisfaction was measured via a 12 question form. Outcomes were measured before, immediately after and one hour after intervention.","Comparison between interventions showed larger decreased arm volume of 140mL (95%CI 17-263) immediately after intervention in favor of the Ai Chi intervention, however it was not sustained at 1h follow-up. A post hoc analysis showed 72% of participants had a decrease in arm volume immediately after Ai Chi compared to 28% immediately after conventional aquatic therapy; with a number needed to treat of 3 (95%CI 1.4-6.6). There were no differences between interventions for bio-impedance. Satisfaction was good for both interventions.","Slow pace aquatic exercise is more effective than conventional aquatic exercise immediately after intervention for arm volume. Also, undesirable increase in arm volume seems to subside after 1h, which can be beneficial if therapy does not address arm volume."

Follow-up phone calls were made at three months.Fall occurrence, perceptions of fall risks, and fall-prevention knowledge.",Patients in the treatment group were significantly more likely to report not falling at three months than patients in the control group. The number of falls was lower for the treatment group. The difference was not statistically significant. Dyads in the treatment group showed significantly greater improvement over time in fall risk awareness and fall-prevention knowledge.,"Mobility skills training is a promising educational intervention for reducing fall occurrences in the home for patients with cancer.Efforts are needed for improving the knowledge and skills of cancer survivors and their family members in recognizing patient fall risks, making home adjustments, and performing mobility skills competently."

1208,30473202,"Hypnotherapy for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been used primarily in patients with refractory symptoms in specialised departments and delivered on an individual basis. We aimed to test the hypothesis that hypnotherapy would be more effective than educational supportive therapy, and that group hypnotherapy would be non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy for patients with IBS referred from primary and secondary care.None.","We did a multicentre randomised controlled trial (IMAGINE) in 11 hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients with IBS, aged 18-65 years, who were referred from primary or secondary care were randomly allocated (3:3:1) in blocks of six using a computer-based random number table procedure by staff not involved in the treatment to receive six sessions of individual or group hypnotherapy or group educational supportive therapy (control group). The primary outcome was adequate relief of IBS symptoms, with responders defined as patients who reported adequate relief when asked once weekly on three or four occasions in 4 consecutive weeks. We compared hypnotherapy (both groups) with control in the intention-to-treat population (excluding individuals subsequently found to be ineligible for enrolment), and assessed non-inferiority of group hypnotherapy versus individual hypnotherapy in the per-protocol population (with a non-inferiority margin of 15%) at 3 months and 12 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN22888906, and is completed.","Between May 31, 2011, and April 6, 2016, 494 patients referred for psychological treatment for IBS were assessed for eligibility, of whom 354 were randomly allocated to the three groups: 150 to individual hypnotherapy, 150 to group hypnotherapy, and 54 to educational supportive therapy. After exclusion of individuals subsequently found to be ineligible for enrolment, 142 patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 146 in the group hypnotherapy group, and 54 in the control group were included in the intention-to-treat population. Of these, 22 (15%) patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 22 (15%) in the group hypnotherapy group, and 11 (20%) in the control group dropped out before or during therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the adequate response rate was 40\u00b78% (95% CI 31\u00b77-50\u00b75) in the individual hypnotherapy group, 33\u00b72% (24\u00b73-43\u00b75) in the group hypnotherapy group, and 16\u00b77% (7\u00b76-32\u00b76) in the control group at 3 months. At 12 months, 40\u00b78% (31\u00b73-51\u00b71) of patients in the individual hypnotherapy group, 49\u00b75% (38\u00b78-60\u00b70) of patients in the group hypnotherapy group, and 22.6% (11\u00b75-39\u00b75) of patients in the control group reported adequate relief. Hypnotherapy was more effective than control at 3 months (odds ratio 2\u00b79, 95% CI 1\u00b72-7\u00b74, p=0\u00b70240) and 12 months (2\u00b78, 1\u00b72-6\u00b77, p=0\u00b70185). In the per-protocol analysis, 49\u00b79% (39\u00b72-60\u00b76) in the individual hypnotherapy group and 42\u00b77% (32\u00b73-53\u00b78) in the group hypnotherapy group had adequate relief at 3 months, and 55\u00b75% (43\u00b74-67\u00b71) of individual and 51\u00b77% (40\u00b72-63\u00b70) of group hypnotherapy patients reported adequate relief at 12 months. Group hypnotherapy was therefore non-inferior to individual hypnotherapy. Eight unexpected serious adverse reactions (six in the individual hypnotherapy group and two in the group hypnotherapy group) were reported, most of which were cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, and were judged by the medical ethics committee as not being related to the therapy.","Hypnotherapy should be considered as a possible treatment for patients with IBS in primary and secondary care. Furthermore, group therapy could allow many more patients to be treated for the same cost."

1210,18308500,First-degree relatives (FDRs) of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) have a two- to threefold increased risk of developing the same disease. Tailored print interventions based on behavior change theories have demonstrated considerable promise in facilitating health-promoting behaviors. This study compared the impact of two mailed print interventions on CRC screening outcomes among FDRs.,"This randomized trial compared effects of two mailed print interventions--one tailored and one nontailored--on participation in CRC screening among FDRs of CRC survivors. Data collected via phone interviews from 140 FDRs at baseline, 1 week post-intervention, and 3 months post-intervention.","At 3 months, both the tailored and nontailored interventions yielded modest but statistically insignificant increases in adherence to any CRC screening test (14% vs. 21%, respectively; p=0.30). While there were no main effects for tailored versus nontailored interventions, there were significant interactions that showed that the tailored print intervention had significantly greater effects on forward stage movement for CRC screening depending on stage of adoption at baseline, race, and objective CRC risk. Receipt of the tailored intervention was 2.5 times more likely to move baseline precontemplators and contemplators forward in stage of adoption for colonoscopy (95% CI: 1.10-5.68) and was three times more likely to move Caucasians forward in stage of adoption for FOBT (95% CI: 1.00-9.07). In addition, the tailored intervention was 7.7 times more likely to move people at average risk forward in stage of adoption for colonoscopy (95% CI: 1.25-47.75).","The tailored print intervention was more effective at moving Caucasians, those in precontemplation and contemplation at baseline, and those at average risk forward in their stage of adoption for CRC screening.Both tailored and nontailored print interventions showed moderate effects for increasing CRC screening participation. Tailored print interventions may be more effective for certain subgroups."

Dietary cruciferous vegetable intake was collected through a validated Arizona Cruciferous Vegetable Intake Questionnaire. Breast tissue was obtained from biopsy samples. Spearman correlations were calculated between intake of specific cruciferous vegetables and biomarkers. Tissue biomarkers were log2-transformed to obtain approximate normality. Linear regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between cruciferous vegetable intake and biomarkers adjusting for age and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. False discovery rate (FDR) was used to account for multiple comparisons.Clinical trial baseline.Fifty-four women who had abnormal mammogram findings and were scheduled for breast biopsy.,"Mean intake of total cruciferous vegetables from all food sources was 81\u00b77 (sd 57\u00b73) g/d.

1212,18029964,"The purpose of this randomized pilot was to determine feasibility of testing Reiki, a complementary therapy intervention, for women undergoing breast biopsy (BB).Increasingly women face the possibility of BB, the definitive test for breast cancer. Psychological distress associated with BB includes anxiety and depression. Reiki was proposed as an intervention to decrease anxiety and promote relaxation.",Thirty-two women scheduled for BB were randomized to Reiki intervention versus conventional care control. Anxiety and depression were evaluated using self-report questionnaires.,Analysis found no significant mean differences between groups over time. Comparably low baseline anxiety levels (possible selection bias) decreased naturally with time allowing little room for observing treatment effect.,"Reiki, when administered in the naturalistic setting of a complementary therapy office, did not suggest evidence of efficacy. An intervention offered within the bounds of the conventional care setting may be more feasible for addressing BB distress."

1214,18675526,"Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or a Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) are in need of information about their disease, treatment options and side effects. Patient education usually has to be given within limited time. Under these circumstances, patients may find it difficult to completely understand and to retain the information given.","As a supplement to standard information methods we developed an interactive CD-ROM with information on SCT. This CD-ROM provides both medical information and more subjective patients' experiences. Part one provides information regarding the treatment course from diagnosis through to post-discharge care. The second part consists of interviews with former patients and describes their experiences. As the system is interactive, it can be utilised according to the patient's individual preferences. The CD-ROM comprises audio, video, animations, pictures, and text. Printing of certain sections is optional. The technical format of the CD-ROM makes it relatively simple to utilise the information and to make it suitable for other institutions or even other treatments. In this preliminary study the acceptability of the interactive CD-ROM by patients undergoing a SCT is described.","Patients' overall evaluations of the interactive CD-ROM were highly positive. For example, 90.2% (N=51) found it interesting, clear, useful and valued getting information by means of a CD-ROM. Most patients would recommend the interactive CD-ROM to other patients in the same situation.","The content of the CD-ROM on SCT as well as the computer-based interactive method are well accepted by patients.Computer-based education may enhance patient education and thus the quality of patient care. We must now establish the program's effectiveness. Moreover, plans have been developed to disseminate the information on SCT over the Internet. Future development of comparable programs and their evaluation should be encouraged to promote the well-being of cancer patients."
1215,16643703,The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of changing the conventional threat-before-efficacy order of threat messages on the persuasiveness of a leaflet informing women smokers of the link between smoking and cervical cancer.,"The study used a between-groups design in which women smokers were sequentially allocated to one of three groups. Two groups received one of two leaflets aimed at providing information about the link between smoking and cervical cancer: one provided threat-before-efficacy information; the other provided efficacy-before-threat information. The third group received no leaflet.Participants (N=178) were recruited by a commercial survey organization. Purposeful sampling was used to ensure that women with a wide range of ages and educational qualifications were included. Outcomes were intention to stop smoking, recall of information, and threat and efficacy perceptions.","Although women in the 'efficacy-before-threat' group recalled more efficacy information, and those in the 'threat-before-efficacy' group recalled more threat information, the leaflets were similarly persuasive. Compared with women not given a leaflet, those given either of the two leaflets had greater intentions to stop smoking and higher threat and efficacy perceptions.",Informing women of the link between smoking and cervical cancer increases their intentions to stop smoking. Changing the order of threat and efficacy information does not influence the persuasiveness of this message. Order effects may be more likely in experimental contexts using weaker messages or those that are not novel.

A single high dose of highly purified senna extract increased proliferation rate and reduced crypt length in the sigmoid colon compared to historical controls.To evaluate in a controlled study the effects of highly purified senna extract on cell proliferation and crypt length in the entire colon and on p53 and bcl-2 expression.,"Addition of a senna extract to colonic lavage was studied in 184 consecutive outpatients. From 32 randomised patients, 15 with sennosides (Sen), 17 without (NSen), biopsies were taken. Proliferative activity was studied in 4 areas of the colon, using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labelling and immunohistochemistry (labelling index, LI). Expression of p53 and bcl-2 in the sigmoid colon was determined immunohistochemically.",Crypts were shorter in Sen than in NSen in the transverse and sigmoid colon. LI was higher in Sen than in NSen in the entire colon. No difference in p53 expression was seen. Bcl-2 expression was higher in both groups when crypts were shorter and/or proliferation was increased.,"Sennosides induce acute massive cell loss probably by apoptosis, causing shorter crypts, and increased cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis to restore cellularity. These effects may reflect the mechanism for the suggested cancer-promoting effect of chronic sennoside use."

Both groups received standard intervention during the LP, but the experimental group also wore VR glasses and watched a video. Following the LP, both groups rated their pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) and were interviewed to evaluate their experience.Pain, subjective evaluation of experience.","Although VAS pain scores were not statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.77), VAS scores tended to be lower in the VR group (median VAS of 7.0, range 0-48) than in the control group (median VAS of 9.0, range 0-59). 77% of subjects in the experimental group said the VR glasses helped to distract them from the LP.","VR glasses are a feasible, age-appropriate, nonpharmacologic adjunct to conventional care in managing the pain associated with LPs in adolescents.The clinical application of various age-appropriate distracters to reduce pain in adolescents undergoing painful procedures should be explored."
1226,25886536,"Postoperative ileus is common after surgery. One non-pharmacological intervention that has shown promising results in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus is chewing gum after surgery. However, this has not been investigated in upper gastrointestinal surgery such as pancreatic surgery. Hence the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chewing gum treatment on patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum whipple due to pancreatic or periampullary cancer.","This study was conducted as a phase III trial that was terminated early. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic tumours scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy ad modum whipple were included. The treatment group received chewing gum postoperatively and standard care. Controls received glucose solution and standard care. Chewing gum and glucose were used four times a day during the whole hospital stay. Time to first flatus and stool was defined as the primary outcome. The secondary outcome was start with clear liquids, start with liquid diet and length of hospital stay.","No statistically significant differences could be observed between the chewing gum intervention group and the control group. However, a numerical difference in mean time was observed in first flatus, first stool, start of clear fluids, and start of liquid diet and length of hospital stay in favour of the intervention group.","Although this study did not find statistically significant differences favouring the use of chewing gum for postoperative ileus, a positive trend was observed of a reduction of the impact of postoperative ileus among patients after pancreatic surgery. It also contributes valuable methodological experience that is important for future studies of chewing gum interventions during recovery after pancreatic surgery."
1227,30247961,"To compare the effectiveness of yoga added to standard care (SC) versus SC only, in women with breast cancer during chemotherapy.","A multicenter pragmatic, randomized controlled study.Three hospitals in the Netherlands.Women with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.Women were randomized either to a program based on Dru Yoga, once a week yoga sessions for 12 weeks (N\u2009=\u200947), or SC only (N\u2009=\u200936).Primary outcome fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory [MFI]; general fatigue) and secondary outcomes fatigue (MFI, Fatigue Quality List [FQL]), quality of life (30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire-C of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC-QLQ-C-30]) and psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [HADS], Impact of Events Scale [IES]) were measured at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2) and analyzed on observed cases. Other outcomes were adequate relief, reintegration to work, and adverse events.","No significant differences were found in general fatigue at T1 (MFI: yoga; 14.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5 vs. SC; 14.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2, p\u2009=\u20090.987). Similar findings were observed for other fatigue (sub)scales of MFI and FQL and functional domains of EORTC. With respect to EORTCs symptom scales, women in the yoga group reported significantly less nausea and vomiting compared with SC at T2 (p\u2009=\u20090.004), but not at T1 (p\u2009=\u20090.807). Depressive symptoms were significantly lower with yoga at T1 (HADS: yoga; 4.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 vs. SC; 5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2, p\u2009=\u20090.031). More women in the yoga group experienced adequate relief compared with SC at T1 (yoga; 51% vs. SC; 19%) and had returned to work at T2 (yoga; 53% vs. SC; 23%). No adverse events were reported with yoga.",A Dru-based yoga program failed to demonstrate a significant beneficial effect on fatigue. Possible favorable effects of the yoga program on nausea and vomiting and early return to work in breast cancer survivors warrant further research.
1228,21859505,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the European community-based project '10 000 Steps Ghent', an intervention that resulted in a significant decrease in sedentary time and a significant increase in step counts (896 steps/d) and self-reported walking (66 min/week).","An age- and gender-dependent Markov model, with a time horizon of 20 years and a cycle length of 1 year, estimating the development of diabetes, cardiovascular events and colorectal cancer.All individuals started in a health state free of events. The effect of the intervention was based on published risk reductions related to increased walking time. Costs and utility decrements related to events were obtained from published literature. The impact of the uncertainty of the parameters on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were assessed with one-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo analysis.Cohort representing the population reached by the intervention (266 adults aged 25-75 years with a mean age of 48\u00b72 (sd 13\u00b71) years, 45\u00b76 % men, 64\u00b76 % highly educated, 70\u00b70 % employed).","Implementing the community-based programme increased average QALY by 0\u00b716 and 0\u00b711 for men and women, respectively.

The sensitivity analyses did not change the conclusion of dominance.",The community-based '10 000 Steps Ghent' campaign is a dominant intervention. Sensitivity analyses have proved the robustness of the results; hence implementing this intervention on a population-based level could lead to improved health outcomes and reduced costs.
1229,29943097,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer disease of women in industrialized countries. Neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs are known to harm peripheral nerves and cause a chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CIPN is one of the most common adverse events associated with Paclitaxel chemotherapy and may remain present long after the termination of chemotherapy. Thus, it reduces the patients' quality of life (QoL) both during chemotherapy and onwards, and can impose a danger on breast cancer survivors due to an increased risk of falling and fall-related injuries.","The aim of this randomized-controlled trial (RCT) (n\u2009=\u200936) (IG: intervention group, n\u2009=\u200917) (CG: control group, n\u2009=\u200919) was to determine whether sensorimotor exercises have a positive effect on physical and psychological parameters in breast cancer patients undergoing neurotoxic chemotherapy (Paclitaxel).","As a result, we were able to show significant improvements in postural stability in monopedal stance [left leg 16.17\u2009\u00b1\u20093.67 vs. 21.55\u2009\u00b1\u20095.33 (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) and right leg 15.14\u2009\u00b1\u20092.30 vs. 20.85\u2009\u00b1\u20095.05 (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001)] and in bipedal stance [T1 vs. T0, -\u20090.49 (IG) vs. +\u20091.14 (CG) p\u2009=\u20090.039].","These results in posturography correlate with the clinical presentation with intervention group patients scoring significantly better on the Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale [37.71\u2009\u00b1\u20092.73 vs. 34.47\u2009\u00b1\u20093.98 (p\u2009=\u20090.004)]. Moderate strength training successfully prevented a strength loss in the IG that was remarkable in the CG (-\u20091.60 vs. 0.60, p\u2009=\u20090.029). Concerning the psychological parameters assessed via EORTC- and MFI-questionnaires, no significant improvements were found.Future studies should focus on the correlation of clinical and posturometry findings and subjective QOL such as the long-term-development of CIPN."
1230,30126463,"Fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) intake can reduce risks for chronic disease, but is much lower than recommended amounts in most Western populations, especially for those with low income levels. Rigorous research is needed on practical, cost-effective interventions that address environmental as well as personal determinants of F&amp;V intake. This paper presents the results of a cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of 'Live Well, Viva Bien' (LWVB), a multicomponent intervention that included discount, mobile fresh F&amp;V markets in conjunction with nutrition education.","Fifteen subsidized housing sites in Providence County, Rhode Island (8 intervention and 7 control sites) were randomized using a random number generator. Of these, nine housed elderly and/or disabled residents and six housed families. A total of 1597 adult housing site residents (treatment n = 837; control n = 760) were enrolled (73% women, 54% Hispanic, 17% black, Mean age 54 years). A year-long multicomponent intervention including mobile F&amp;V markets plus nutrition education (e.g. campaigns, DVDs, newsletters, recipes, and chef demonstrations) was implemented at intervention sites. Physical activity and stress interventions were implemented at control sites. Follow-up occurred at 6 and 12 months. The main outcome measure was F&amp;V consumption measured by National Cancer Institute's 'Eating at America's Table All Day Screener'.","From baseline to 12 months, the intervention group increased total F&amp;V intake by 0.44 cups with the control group decreasing intake by 0.08 cups (p &lt; .02). Results also showed an increased frequency of F&amp;V eating behaviors compared to the control group (p &lt; .01). There was a clear dose response effect of the F&amp;V markets with participants who reported attending all or most of the markets increasing F&amp;V intake by 2.1 cups and 0.86 cups, respectively compared with less than half cup increases for lower levels of market attendance (p &lt; .05). Use of the DVDs, recipes and taste-testings was also associated with greater increases in F&amp;V intake; however, use of other educational components was not.","LWVB is the first cluster, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of year-round F&amp;V markets on improving F&amp;V intake for low-income adults, which provides an evidence-base to bolster the mission of mobile produce markets. Further, the results more broadly support investment in environmental changes to alleviate disparities in F&amp;V consumption and diet-related health inequities."

1237,8998184,"In response to the isolation of the BRCA1 gene, a breast-ovarian cancer-susceptibility gene, biotechnology companies are already marketing genetic tests to health care providers and to the public. Initial studies indicate interest in BRCA1 testing in the general public and in populations at high risk. However, the optimal strategies for educating and counseling individuals have yet to be determined.Our goal was to evaluate the impact of alternate strategies for pretest education and counseling on decision-making regarding BRCA1 testing among women at low to moderate risk who have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer.","A randomized trial design was used to evaluate the effects of education only (educational approach) and education plus counseling (counseling approach), as compared with a waiting-list (control) condition (n = 400 for all groups combined). The educational approach reviewed information about personal risk factors, inheritance of cancer susceptibility, the benefits, limitations, and risks of BRCA1 testing, and cancer screening and prevention options. The counseling approach included this information, as well as a personalized discussion of experiences with cancer in the family and the potential psychological and social impact of testing. Data on knowledge of inherited cancer and BRCA1 test characteristics, perceived risk, perceived benefits, limitations and risks of BRCA1 testing, and testing intentions were collected by use of structured telephone interviews at baseline and at 1-month follow-up. Provision of a blood sample for future testing served as a proxy measure of intention to be tested (in the education and counseling arms of the study). The effects of intervention group on study outcomes were evaluated by use of hierarchical linear regression modeling and logistic regression modeling (for the blood sample outcome). All P values are for two-sided tests.","The educational and counseling approaches both led to significant increases in knowledge, relative to the control condition (P &lt; .001 for both). The counseling approach, but not the educational approach, was superior to the control condition in producing significant increases in perceived limitations and risks of BRCA1 testing (P &lt; .01) and decreases in perceived benefits (P &lt; .05). However, neither approach produced changes in intentions to have BRCA1 testing. Prior to and following both education only and education plus counseling, approximately one half of the participants stated that they intended to be tested; after the session, 52% provided a blood sample.","Standard educational approaches may be equally effective as expanded counseling approaches in enhancing knowledge. Since knowledge is a key aspect of medical decision-making, standard education may be adequate in situations where genetic testing must be streamlined. On the other hand, it has been argued that optimal decision-making requires not only knowledge, but also a reasoned evaluation of the positive and negative consequences of alternate decisions. Although the counseling approach is more likely to achieve this goal, it may not diminish interest in testing, even among women at low to moderate risk. Future research should focus on the merits of these alternate approaches for subgroups of individuals with different backgrounds who are being counseled in the variety of settings where BRCA1 testing is likely to be offered."
1238,11517848,Determine the impact of a 16-week supportive nursing intervention on caregivers of patients with newly diagnosed cancer.,"Randomized clinical trial.Two midwestern cancer treatment sites.Caregivers of newly diagnosed patients. Patients' mean age was 55.73 years; 55% had breast cancer, and 76% were female. Caregivers' mean age was 52.44 years, and 50% were female. 125 dyads consented to participate; 89 dyads completed the study.A nursing intervention was delivered to the experimental group that emphasized symptom monitoring/management, education, emotional support, coordination of services, and caregiver preparation to care. Nurses made a total of nine contacts, five in person and four by telephone, over 16 weeks. Centers for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and a symptom inventory were used. Medical record audits were conducted retrospectively.Patient and caregiver depression scores and patient symptom experience.","Baseline caregiver depression and the number of patient symptoms at baseline, 9, and 24 weeks were significant predictors of caregiver depression at 9 and 24 weeks. However, no main effect of the experimental condition existed on caregiver depression. At the final observation, a nonsignificant inverse relationship was found between the number of interventions and depression scores for caregivers.",The intervention appeared to be more effective in slowing the rate of deterioration of depressive symptoms than in decreasing levels of depression in this sample of caregivers. Determining the effectiveness of this intervention in decreasing caregiver depression was difficult because caregivers with higher levels of depression were more likely to withdraw from the study.Nurses must be vigilant in monitoring caregivers for signs of depression and must intervene to provide emotional support and make appropriate referrals for follow-up care to promote positive outcomes for patients and caregivers.
1239,23964055,Observational and experimental studies suggest that diets rich in cruciferous vegetables and glucosinolates may reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD).We tested the hypothesis that a 12-wk dietary intervention with high-glucoraphanin (HG) broccoli would modify biomarkers of CVD risk and plasma metabolite profiles to a greater extent than interventions with standard broccoli or peas.,"Subjects were randomly assigned to consume 400 g standard broccoli, 400 g HG broccoli, or 400 g peas each week for 12 wk, with no other dietary restrictions. Biomarkers of CVD risk and 347 plasma metabolites were quantified before and after the intervention.","No significant differences in the effects of the diets on biomarkers of CVD risk were found. Multivariate analyses of plasma metabolites identified 2 discrete phenotypic responses to diet in individuals within the HG broccoli arm, differentiated by single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the PAPOLG gene. Univariate analysis showed effects of sex (P &lt; 0.001), PAPOLG genotype (P &lt; 0.001), and PAPOLG genotype \u00d7 diet (P &lt; 0.001) on the plasma metabolic profile. In the HG broccoli arm, the consequence of the intervention was to reduce variation in lipid and amino acid metabolites, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, and acylcarnitines between the 2 PAPOLG genotypes.",The metabolic changes observed with the HG broccoli diet are consistent with a rebalancing of anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions and enhanced integration of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation with TCA cycle activity. These modifications may contribute to the reduction in cancer risk associated with diets that are rich in cruciferous vegetables. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01114399.

Phase 2: (1) vaginal self-sampling kits (SSKs) sent unrequested (n\u2009=\u20091141); or (2) offered on request (n\u2009=\u20091290); (3) provided with a timed appointment (n\u2009=\u20091629); (4) offered access to a nurse navigator (NN) (n\u2009=\u20091007); or (5) offered a choice between a NN or a SSK (n\u2009=\u20091277); and 3782 women in control practices.Uplift in screening compared with control practices, cost-effectiveness of interventions, and the women's preferences explored in a discrete choice experiment.","The pre-invitation leaflet and offer of online booking were ineffective when compared with control practices at 3 months, 18.8% versus 19.2% [odds ratio (OR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.06; p\u2009=\u20090.485] and 17.8% versus 17.2% (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; p\u2009=\u20090.802), respectively. The uptake of screening at 3 months was higher among previously human papillomavirus (HPV)-vaccinated women than unvaccinated women, 23.7% versus 11% (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.53; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). Among non-attenders, the SSK sent intervention showed a statistically significant increase in uptake at 12 months post invitation, 21.3% versus 16.2% (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.91; p\u2009=\u20090.001), as did timed appointments, 19.8% versus 16.2% (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.74; p\u2009=\u20090.001). The offer of a NN, a SSK on request, and a choice between timed appointments and NN were ineffective. Overall, there was a gradual rather than prompt response, as demonstrated by uptake among control practices. A discrete choice experiment indicated that women invited who had not yet attended valued the attributes inherent in self-sampling. The health economic analysis showed that both timed appointments and unsolicited SSK sent were likely to be cost-effective at a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of \u00a37593 and \u00a38434, respectively, if extended across the national 25-year-old cohort throughout the duration of screening. The certainty of these being cost-effective at a ceiling ratio of \u00a320,000 per QALY gained was &gt;\u200990%.","Women receiving their initial screening invitation frequently delay taking up the offer and the net impact of interventions was small. Timed appointments and SSKs sent to non-attenders at 6 months are likely to be a cost-effective means of increasing uptake and should be considered further. HPV vaccination in the catch-up programme was associated with an increased uptake of cervical screening. Future work should focus on optimising self-sampling in terms of age range, timing of offer for non-attenders and use of urine testing instead of vaginal samples."
1241,8730607,"Dietary fat intake is higher than recommended in most western countries and is associated with the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, obesity and cancer. The growing public concern about the adverse effects of a high fat intake has led to an increased availability of \u00bfreduced-fat' products. Consumption of reduced-fat products might be a convenient way to reduce the energy intake. Besides the potential of reduced-fat products to reduce the energy intake, it might change dietary fat intake, both qualitatively and quantitatively, which in turn might also affect oxidative stress, i.e. the anti-oxidant/pro-oxidant ratio. In this paper we present the effects of 6-month consumption of reduced-fat products on body weight, energy, macronutrient and vitamin E intake, concentration of the plasma lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA), erythrocyte free radical scavenging enzymes activities (glutathione peroxidase activity (GSH-Px); superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase) as well as plasma fat-soluble anti-oxidative vitamin concentrations (beta-carotene, lycopene and alpha-tocopherol).","A randomized semi-controlled parallel comparison trial of six months, preceded by a one-month adaptation period.The reduced-fat and full fat products were provided through a realistic shop in order to mimic a \u00bffree-living' situation.Subjects were recruited from respondents on advertisements.

Body weight, the ratio polyunsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids, plasma MDA, vitamin concentrations (beta-carotene, lycopene and alpha-tocopherol), and erythrocyte free radical scavenging enzyme activities (SOD, GSH-Px and catalase) were not affected by the intervention.","Neither the difference in energy intake, nor the change in dietary fat composition seems to affect the integrity of the antioxidant scavenging capacity, assessed by measuring plasma MDA and antioxidative vitamins (lycopene, beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol) and erythrocyte free radical scavenging enzymes (SOD, GSH-Px and catalase)."
1242,16125515,A multidimensional rehabilitation program for cancer survivors was developed to overcome cancer-related problems and to improve quality of life.

Measurements were performed before (T0) and after the rehabilitation program (T1), and at a 3-month follow-up (T2).","After the rehabilitation program, cancer survivors (n=63) displayed statistically significant improvements on health-related quality of life with effect sizes (ES) varying from 0.38 to 0.99 (RAND-36) and from -0.34 to -0.57 (RSCL), most persistent at 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, statistically significant improvements in exercise capacity and muscle force of upper and lower extremities were displayed after rehabilitation. If offered a choice, 80% of the patients prior to start and 58% of the patients after completion of the program indicated that they preferred the entire multidimensional program.","A multidimensional rehabilitation program has statistically and clinically relevant beneficial effects on health-related quality of life, exercise capacity, and muscle force in cancer patients with different diagnoses. Furthermore, if offered the choice, the majority of cancer survivors seem to prefer multidimensional programs to programs with only one component."

1251,25539779,Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening is controversial. A community jury allows presentation of complex information and may clarify how participants view screening after being well-informed. We examined whether participating in a community jury had an effect on men's knowledge about and their intention to participate in PSA screening.,"Random allocation to either a 2-day community jury or a control group, with preassessment, postassessment and 3-month follow-up assessment.Participants from the Gold Coast (Australia) recruited via radio, newspaper and community meetings.Twenty-six men aged 50-70 years with no previous diagnosis of prostate cancer.The control group (n=14) received factsheets on PSA screening. Community jury participants (n=12) received the same factsheets and further information about screening for prostate cancer. In addition, three experts presented information on PSA screening: a neutral scientific advisor provided background information, one expert emphasised the potential benefits of screening and another expert emphasised the potential harms. Participants discussed information, asked questions to the experts and deliberated on personal and policy decisions.","Analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat. Immediately after the jury, the community jury group had less intention-to-screen for prostate cancer than men in the control group (effect size=-0.6 SD, p=0.05). This was sustained at 3-month follow-up. Community jury men also correctly identified PSA test accuracy and considered themselves more informed (effect size=1.2 SD, p&lt;0.001).",Evidence-informed deliberation of the harms and benefits of PSA screening effects men's individual choice to be screened for prostate cancer. Community juries may be a valid method for eliciting target group input to policy decisions.
1252,8360931,"Epidemiologic evidence indicates that diets high in fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of several cancers, including cancers of the esophagus and stomach. Vitamins and minerals in these foods may contribute to the reduced cancer risk. The people of Linxian County, China, have one of the world's highest rates of esophageal/gastric cardia cancer and a persistently low intake of several micronutrients.We sought to determine if dietary supplementation with specific vitamins and minerals can lower mortality from or incidence of cancer as well as mortality from other diseases in Linxian.","Individuals of ages 40-69 were recruited in 1985 from four Linxian communes. Mortality and cancer incidence during March 1986-May 1991 were ascertained for 29,584 adults who received daily vitamin and mineral supplementation throughout this period. The subjects were randomly assigned to intervention groups according to a one-half replicate of a 2(4) factorial experimental design. This design enabled testing for the effects of four combinations of nutrients: (A) retinol and zinc; (B) riboflavin and niacin; (C) vitamin C and molybdenum; and (D) beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium. Doses ranged from one to two times U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances.","A total of 2127 deaths occurred among trial participants during the intervention period. Cancer was the leading cause of death, with 32% of all deaths due to esophageal or stomach cancer, followed by cerebrovascular disease (25%). Significantly (P = .03) lower total mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.99) occurred among those receiving supplementation with beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium. The reduction was mainly due to lower cancer rates (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.75-1.00), especially stomach cancer (RR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.64-0.99), with the reduced risk beginning to arise about 1-2 years after the start of supplementation with these vitamins and minerals. No significant effects on mortality rates from all causes were found for supplementation with retinol and zinc, riboflavin and niacin, or vitamin C and molybdenum. Patterns of cancer incidence, on the basis of 1298 cases, generally resembled those for cancer mortality.","The findings indicate that vitamin and mineral supplementation of the diet of Linxian adults, particularly with the combination of beta carotene, vitamin E, and selenium, may effect a reduction in cancer risk in this population.The results on their own are not definitive, but the promising findings should stimulate further research to clarify the potential benefits of micronutrient supplements."

Subjects then received either probiotic capsules (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum) or placebo capsules through day 7 of menstrual cycle 3, at which time both the plasma hormone concentrations and the post-soy challenge urinary equol measurements were repeated.","During menstrual cycle 1, equol excretors and non-excretors were not significantly different with respect to subject characteristics, diet, or hormone concentrations. Significant inverse correlations were found between E(2) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.02), SHBG and BMI (P=0.01), DHEA-S and dietary fiber (P=0.04), and A and protein:carbohydrate ratio (P=0.02). Probiotic consumption failed to significantly alter equol excretor status or hormone concentrations during menstrual cycle 3, although there were trends towards decreased concentrations of T (P=0.14) and SHBG (P=0.10) in the probiotic group.","We were unable to verify a previously reported finding of premenopausal equol excretors having plasma hormone concentrations different from those of nonexcretors.

1258,8537982,"Ongoing epidemiologic and nutritional studies suggest that colorectal carcinogenesis is consistent with complex interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental and dietary factors. Among the dietary components found to reduce colon cancer risk are high intakes of dietary fiber and calcium.We designed and conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving supplementation of the customary dietary intake with fiber and calcium and measurements of fecal bile acids to examine the potential mechanisms by which added dietary interventions might reduce colorectal cancer risk.","In a randomized, double-blinded, phase II study, we used a factorial design to measure the effects of dietary wheat bran fiber (2.0 or 13.5 g/day) in the form of cereal and supplemental calcium carbonate (250 or 1500 mg/day elemental calcium) taken as a tablet on fecal bile acid concentrations and excretion rates. Measurements were made at base-line randomization (i.e., after a 3-month placebo run-in period using 2.0 g wheat bran fiber plus 250 mg calcium carbonate) and after 3 and 9 months on treatment in a randomly selected 52-patient subsample of the 95 fully assessable study participants who had a history of colon adenoma resection. Concentrations of fecal bile acids, total, primary (i.e., chenodeoxycholic and cholic), and secondary (i.e., deoxycholic, lithocholic, and ursodeoxycholic), were measured in 72-hour stool samples by gas-liquid chromatography. All P values resulted from two-sided tests.","All geometric mean fecal bile acid concentrations and excretion rates were lower at 9 months than at 0 months or 3 months on treatment in the high-dose fiber, high-dose calcium, and high-dose fiber/high-dose calcium treatment groups. The high-dose fiber effect at 9 months of supplementation was statistically significant with respect to virtually all geometric mean fecal bile acid concentrations and excretion rates. For example at 9 months versus 0 months, high-dose fiber supplementation caused a reduction in fecal concentrations of total bile acids (52% reduction; P = .001) and deoxycholic acid (48% reduction; P = .003). High-dose calcium supplementation also had a significant, but lower, effect at 9 months versus 0 months on the geometric mean total bile acid (35% reduction; P = .044) and deoxycholic fecal bile acid (36% reduction; P = .052) concentrations.",High-dose wheat bran fiber and calcium carbonate supplements given for 9 months are associated with statistically significant reductions in both total and secondary fecal bile acid concentrations and excretion rates in patients with resected colon adenomas. This study supports the hypothesis that one of the important ways in which a high intake of wheat bran fiber and calcium may reduce the risk of colorectal neoplasia and cancer is by reduction of the concentrations of fecal bile acids.Phase III studies of these agents in the prevention of adenoma recurrence are necessary to confirm this hypothesis and have now been initiated at multiple institutions.

They formed a partnership with academic researchers to develop and evaluate a low-cost, community-based Workbook-Journal (WBJ) for improving psychosocial functioning in geographically and economically isolated women with primary breast cancer.","A randomized controlled trial was used to compare the WBJ intervention plus educational materials to educational materials alone (usual care).One rural cancer center and several private medical, surgical, and radiation oncology practices in 7 rural counties in the Sierra Nevada Foothills of California.One hundred women with primary breast cancer who were either within 3 months of diagnosis or within 3 months of completing treatment.A community-initiated, theoretically-based Workbook-Journal, designed by rural breast cancer survivors and providers as a support group alternative. It included compelling personal stories, local rural resources, coping strategies, and messages of hope.","Community recruiters enrolled 83% of the women referred to the study. Retention at 3-month follow-up was 98%. There were no main effects for the WBJ. However, 3 significant interactions suggested that women who were treated in rural practices reported decreased fighting spirit and increased emotional venting and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms if they did not receive the WBJ. Among women who receive the WBJ, 74% felt emotionally supported.","This community-based Workbook-Journal may be an effective psychosocial intervention for rural, isolated, and low-income women with breast cancer. Community involvement was essential to the success of this project."

Intervention Randomized intensive, repetitive written educational reinforcement.Retention of knowledge and the effect on sun-protective behavior were assessed with a follow-up questionnaire at 3 and 10 months.","Both intervention groups had similarly high baseline and 3- and 10-month scores on the knowledge portion of the surveys, and they had similar scores on the behavioral assessment portion of the surveys at baseline. Subjects receiving intensive education scored significantly better on the behavioral assessment at 3 and 10 months, although an improvement in knowledge was not documented.","This cohort of transplant recipients was well educated about skin cancer prevention before educational intervention and retained this knowledge. Patients who received the intensive educational intervention were significantly more compliant with recommendations for sun-protective behavior than those who received standard education, although differences in knowledge were not apparent. Lack of time and hassle were the most commonly cited barriers to behavioral compliance with sun protection."

Despite having easy preventive and therapeutic approaches, it is an important cause of mortality among women.","The CRICERVA study is a cluster clinical trial which assigned one of three interventions to the target population registered in Cerdanyola, Barcelona. Among the 5,707 resident women aged 60 to 70 years in the study area, women with no record of cervical cytology over the last three years were selected. The study included four arms: three interventions all including a pre-assigned date for screening visit and i) personalized invitation letter; ii) adding to i) an informative leaflet; and, iii) in addition to ii) a personalized appointment reminder phone call, and iv) no specific action taken (control group). Participants were offered a personal interview about social-demographic characteristics and about screening attitudes. Cervical cytology and HPV DNA test (HC2) were offered as screening tests. In the case of screening positive in any of these tests, the women were followed up until a full diagnosis could be obtained. The effect size of each study arm was estimated as the absolute gain in coverage between the original coverage and the final coverage.","From the intervention groups (4,775 women), we identified 3,616 who were not appropriately screened, of which 2,560 women answered the trial call and 1,376 were amenable to screening. HPV was tested in 920 women and cervical cytology in all 1,376. Overall, there was an absolute gain in coverage of 28.8% in the intervention groups compared to 6% in the control group. Coverage increased from 51.2% to 76.0% in strategy i); from 47.4% to 79.0% in strategy ii) and from 44.5% to 74.6% in strategy iii). Lack of information about the relevance of screening was the most important factor for not attending the screening program.","The study confirms that actively contacting women and including a date for a screening visit, notably increased participation in the screening program.

In addition, in people with a (family) history of skin cancer, HTI significantly lowered the intention compared to the no-information group.","HTI regarding skin cancer can cause a drop in the preventative motivation. The effects can be conceptualised as negative side-effects of HTI. As substantial proportions of the general population have a (family) history of skin cancer or low self-efficacy, the side-effects may be widespread, possibly increasing the incidence of skin cancer."

Exit surveys of patients at moderate to high risk of skin cancer were conducted 1 month before and 1 month after the intervention to measure physician skin cancer control practices reported by patients. Eighty-two physicians completed baseline questionnaires and were enrolled in the study, 46 in the intervention group and 36 in the control group. Twenty-five physicians attended both sessions, 11 attended one, and 10 attended neither. Postintervention, the percentage of physicians feeling adequately trained increased from 35% to 47% in the control group (p = .34) and from 37% to 57% in the intervention group (p = .06). Intervention physicians had an absolute mean improvement in their risk factor identification score of 6.7%, while control physicians' mean score was unchanged (p = .06). Intervention and control physicians had similar increases in their postintervention lesion identification and management scores. Postintervention, the mean proportion of patients per physician stating they were advised to watch their moles increased more among intervention physicians than control physicians (absolute difference of 19% vs -8%, p = .04). Other changes in behavior were not significant.","Although we observed a few modest intervention effects, overall this brief skin cancer education intervention did not significantly affect primary care physicians' skin cancer control attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors.

The concentration of alpha-tocopherol increased (CO: 22.99 +/- 1.11 vs. OSO: 24.40 +/- 1.49 micromol/l) and that of gamma-tocopherol decreased (CO: 4.19 +/- 0.29 vs. OSO: 2.99 +/- 0.25 micromol/l) after the olive/sunflower oil diet. Intake of the corn oil diet was associated with reduced SCE rate and intensity, whereas there was no change in SCE after the olive/sunflower oil diet (CO: 7.66 +/- 0.25 vs. OSO: 8.06 +/- 0.47 mean SCE/cell)",The combination of gamma-tocopherol with alpha-tocopherol in corn oil diet despite the lower alpha-tocopherol equivalents/diene acid equivalents ratio achieved better protection against DNA damage than alpha-tocopherol alone in the olive/sunflower oil diet.
1269,23159252,Shared decision making (SDM) is a widely recommended yet unproven strategy for increasing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening uptake. Previous trials of decision aids to increase SDM and CRC screening uptake have yielded mixed results.To assess the impact of decision aid-assisted SDM on CRC screening uptake.,"RCT.The study was conducted at an urban, academic safety-net hospital and community health center between 2005 and 2010. Participants were asymptomatic, average-risk patients aged 50-75 years due for CRC screening.Study participants (n=825) were randomized to one of two intervention arms (decision aid plus personalized risk assessment or decision aid alone) or control arm. The interventions took place just prior to a routine office visit with their primary care providers.The primary outcome was completion of a CRC screening test within 12 months of the study visit. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of test completion and mediators of the intervention effect. Analysis was completed in 2011.","Patients in the decision-aid group were more likely to complete a screening test than control patients (43.1% vs 34.8%, p=0.046) within 12 months of the study visit; conversely, test uptake for the decision aid and decision aid plus personalized risk assessment arms was similar (43.1% vs 37.1%, p=0.15). Assignment to the decision-aid arm (AOR=1.48, 95% CI=1.04, 2.10), black race (AOR=1.52, 95% CI=1.12, 2.06) and a preference for a patient-dominant decision-making approach (AOR=1.55, 95% CI=1.02, 2.35) were independent determinants of test completion. Activation of the screening discussion and enhanced screening intentions mediated the intervention effect.",Decision aid-assisted SDM has a modest impact on CRC screening uptake. A decision aid plus personalized risk assessment tool is no more effective than a decision aid alone.

Group 1 served as controls with only normal saline, and group 2 as the indigowood root (IR) group.Prophylactic application of IR consisted of gargling and then swallowing the IR preparation on the irradiated oral mucosa.Patients' characteristic distribution of gender, age, diagnosis, and mean radiation dose between the two arms were calculated by Fisher's exact test. We compared the mean of grade 1-4 mucositis, anorexia, difficulty in swallowing, and body weight change with the Mann-Whitney U test. p values less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance.","The clinical trial showed that application of IR can reduce the severity of radiation mucositis (p = 0.01), anorexia (p = 0.002), and swallowing difficulty (p = 0.002). Although patients' resting days did not show a significant difference (p = 0.06), complete radiotherapy was done without rest for 4 of 11 patients in the IR group versus 2 of 9 in controls. Hemoglobin level between both groups showed no significant difference. Serum interleukin-6 was significantly lower in the IR group during the first, fifth, and seventh weeks.","We confirmed that indigowood root has anti-inflammatory ability to reduce the mucosal damage caused by radiation. We postulate that indirubin may play a pharmaceutical role in improvement of radiation mucositis, anorexia, and difficulty in swallowing in our clinical trial. However, the exact mechanisms and pathways still need further analysis."

For highly anxious patients, the STAI score decreased significantly more in the IPA group (10.2 points, 95% CI 7.4 to 13.0) than in the SAI group (6.8 points, 95% CI 3.8 to 9.8), P\u200a=\u200a0.024.The information provided during the anaesthesiology visit was correctly understood by more than 80% of patients and was similar in both groups.","In breast cancer surgical patients with high levels of preoperative anxiety, a multidisciplinary approach with psycho-oncological intervention proved to be useful at the preoperative anaesthesiology interview."
1276,11064881,"To evaluate the success of a multifaceted, hospicewide, nurse-focused pain-management intervention for improving patient pain outcomes.","Comparative, descriptive.A large, nonprofit hospice that primarily provides home care.Two samples were included in the study. One sample (n = 47) was from a study completed in 1995 before the intervention, and one (n = 255) was from a study completed in 1997 after the intervention. All patients had been diagnosed with cancer and were alert and able to self-report.Secondary analysis of data that were collected as part of two quality-of-life studies. The four-part intervention included intensive pain-management education for the nurses, development and implementation of pain-management policies and procedures, changes in pain assessment and management documentation, and development and use of quality assurance monitors by the nursing staff.Pain at its worst, pain relief, and quality of life.","Adjusted mean pain-relief scores were significantly lower in 1995 (X = 5.8) than in 1997 (X = 8.4). In 1995, 43% of patients reported pain relief at a level of 5 or less (on a 0-10 scale). This number dropped to 10% by 1997. Adjusted mean pain-at-its-worst scores were significantly lower in 1997 (X = 6.1) than in 1995 (X = 6.7). Pain relief was found to be positively correlated (r = 0.41-0.51) with quality of life in both samples.","The hospicewide pain-management intervention was effective.Through careful study and multifaceted nurse-focused interventions, pain outcomes of hospice patients with cancer can be improved."

In the intervention group, dietary fat intake was reduced from 33.46+/-1.27% energy/day to 21.04+/-1.74% (P&lt;0.05), fiber intake increased from 14.6+/-1.06 to 21.05+/-2.29 g/day. The insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) level was decreased from 260.4+/-8.6 ng/ml at baseline to 220.5+/-7.9 ng/ml at 6 months (P&lt;0.05) in the intervention group with no significant change in the control group. An ex vivo assay demonstrated inhibition of LNCaP cell growth (-20.0+/-7.7%, P&lt;0.05) by sera from patients in the intervention group after 6 months of dietary change compared to baseline.","These data suggest that long-term low-fat dietary interventions as part of prospective randomized trials in prostate cancer survivors are feasible, and lead to reductions in circulating hormones or other growth factors stimulating prostate cancer growth ex vivo."
1278,29360672,"Compelling evidence has yet to be published regarding the positive effect of psychoeducational interventions (PEIs) on psychological distress in patients with breast cancer. The impact of PEIs on self-efficacy, resilience, and quality of life is also unclear.The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a PEI on anxiety, depression, disease-specific care knowledge, self-efficacy, resilience and quality of life in patients with breast cancer during and after chemotherapy. The intervention was administered before and during five rounds of chemotherapy treatment.","A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with breast cancer (N = 40) were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group participated in PEI, a brief and highly structured program consisting of two parts: (a) an educational manual that addressed depression, anxiety, disease-specific care knowledge, self-efficacy, and resilience and (b) a self-assessment of learning. The control group received only traditional pamphlet education. Data were collected at four time points: before the first chemotherapy session (T1), during the third chemotherapy session (T2), during the fifth chemotherapy session (T3), and at 2 weeks after the final chemotherapy session (T4).","Anxiety, depression, resilience, and quality of life in the experimental group showed significant differences at T4. Significant differences became apparent at T2 for knowledge and at T3 for self-efficacy. The effects of knowledge, resilience, and quality of life remained significant when group and time interactions were included in the model, showing a positive relationship between PEI and the variables of knowledge, resilience, and quality of life.","Face-to-face PEI for patients with breast cancer is potentially effective in improving knowledge, resilience, and quality of life during and after chemotherapy. In the current study, PEI significantly improved disease care techniques, reduced chemotherapy-related discomfort, and improved quality of life for participants in the experimental group."
1279,28560503,"Low fruit and vegetable consumption is linked with an increased risk of death from vascular disease and cancer. The benefit of eating fruits and vegetables is attributed in part to antioxidants, vitamins and phytochemicals. Whether increasing intake impacts on markers of disease remains to be established. This study investigates whether increasing daily intake of fruits, vegetables and juices from low (approx. 3 portions), to high intakes (approx. 8 portions) impacts on nutritional and clinical biomarkers. Barriers to achieving the recommended fruit and vegetable intakes are also investigated.","In a randomised clinical trial, the participants [19 men and 26 women (39-58\u00a0years)] with low reported fruit, juice and vegetable intake (&lt;3 portions/day) were randomised to consume either their usual diet or a diet supplemented with an additional 480\u00a0g of fruit and vegetables and fruit juice (300\u00a0ml) daily for 12\u00a0weeks. Nutritional biomarkers (vitamin C, carotenoids, B vitamins), antioxidant capacity and genomic stability were measured pre-intervention, at 4-, 8- and 12\u00a0weeks throughout the intervention. Samples were also taken post-intervention after a 6-week washout period. Glucose, homocysteine, lipids, blood pressure, weight and arterial stiffness were also measured. Intake of fruit, fruit juice and vegetables was reassessed 12\u00a0months after conducting the study and a questionnaire was developed to identify barriers to healthy eating.","Intake increased significantly in the intervention group compared to controls, achieving 8.4 portions/day after 12\u00a0weeks. Plasma vitamin C (35%), folate (15%) and certain carotenoids [\u03b1-carotene (50%) and \u03b2-carotene (70%) and lutein/zeaxanthin (70%)] were significantly increased (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) in the intervention group. There were no significant changes in antioxidant capacity, DNA damage and markers of vascular health. Barriers to achieving recommended intakes of fruits and vegetables measured 12\u00a0months after the intervention period were amount, inconvenience and cost.","While increasing fruit, juice and vegetable consumption increases circulating level of beneficial nutrients in healthy subjects, a 12-week intervention was not associated with effects on antioxidant status or lymphocyte DNA damage."
1280,20619137,"Radiation pneumonitis is one of the most common complications during radiotherapy of thoracic tumors. It impacts the quality of life of the patients and has life-threatening danger. However, there is a lack of drugs for prevention and treatment of this disease.To evaluate the efficacy of Liangxue Jiedu Huoxue Decoction, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, in prevention of radiation pneumonitis.","The incidence rates of radiation pneumonitis in the two groups were calculated. Acute radiation injury scoring criteria by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), clinical-radiographic-physiologic (CRP) score system, and Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) were used to evaluate the status of the patients.","The incidence rate of radiation pneumonitis was lower in the treatment group than in the control group (13.04% versus 33.33%, P&lt;0.05).

Between May and October 2013, 28 patients were included in the study. After signing the informed consent form, the patients were provided with ARM to apply this twice daily from the beginning of the treatment. All of them had a prescribed dose of IMRT \u2265 60 Gy. They were evaluated weekly by nurses on the ward. A photographic monitoring of the skin with a registered grade of epithelitis and with signs of pain or other was carried out. The control group was formed of 34 consecutive patients with HNC treated with IMRT months prior to the study, whose skin treatment had been different products.","Both groups were comparable (age, sex, region and RT dose). In the study group (ARM), the number of treatments per patient (p = 0.3) and the natural days for treatment per patient (p = 0.38) were less; also, the number of patients who required treatments and who suffered from radiodermitis of III-IV grade, were less. It is probable that the limited specimen size may have influenced in the statistics.","The effectiveness of ARM in the prevention of severe epithelitis in patients with HNC treated with RT is, at least, as effective (or more effective) as other and more common skin treatments. A randomized study would be required to confirm these findinas."

Information was solicited regarding drug-related (and other) problems. Problems were addressed, and advice and support were given.",Analysis of variance revealed no differences in the physical well-being dimension of health-related quality of life between patients who received telephone follow-up and a control group who did not. Sixty-eight percent of the follow-up group and 40% of the control group (p = 0.007) reported having had at least one contact with a health professional.,One possible explanation for the lack of effect of the intervention is that high-risk patients in the control group received a similar intervention from other health care professionals. We suggest that telephone follow-up be coordinated among health professionals.
1283,19887342,Two analytical approaches are described for a randomized trial testing interventions for symptom management.,"To compare an intention-to-treat with a perprotocol approach.Patients were accrued from six cancer centers.94 men and 140 women with solid tumors were accrued.An intention-to-treat approach (as randomized) and per-protocol analyses (at least one symptom reaching threshold and one follow-up intervention) were compared. The analysis determines how each approach affects results. A two-arm, six-contact, eight-week trial was implemented. In one arm, nurses followed a cognitive behavioral protocol. In the second arm, a non-nurse coach referred patients to a symptom management guide.Trial arm; summed severity scores; interference-based severity categories at intake, 10 weeks, and 16 weeks; site; and stage of cancer.","Each arm produced a reduction in severity at 10 and 16 weeks with no differences between arms. In the per-protocol analyses, symptoms reported at the first contact required more time to resolve. Older patients exposed to the nurse arm resolved in fewer contacts.","The intention-to-treat analyses indicated that both arms were successful but offered few insights into how symptoms or patients influenced severity. Per-protocol analyses (intervention and dose), when, and which strategies affected symptoms.Each analytical strategy serves a purpose. Intention-to-treat defines the success of a trial. Per-protocol analyses allow nurses to pose clinical questions about response and dose of the intervention. Nurses should participate in analyses of interventions to understand the conditions where interventions are successful."
1284,17925060,"Messages designed to motivate participation in physical activity usually emphasize the benefits of physical activity (gain-framed) as well as the costs of inactivity (loss-framed). The framing implications of prospect theory suggest that the effectiveness of these messages could be enhanced by providing gain-framed information only. We compared the effectiveness of gain-, loss-, and mixed-framed messages for promoting moderate to vigorous physical activity.","Randomized trial.Sedentary, healthy callers to the US National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (N=322) received gain-, loss-, or mixed-framed messages on three occasions (baseline, Week 1, and Week 5). Social cognitive variables and self-reported physical activity were assessed at baseline, Week 2, and Week 9. Separate regression analyses were conducted to examine message effects at each assessment point.","At Week 2, gain- and mixed-framed messages resulted in stronger intentions and greater self-efficacy than loss-framed messages. At Week 9, gain-framed messages resulted in greater physical activity participation than loss- or mixed-framed messages. Social cognitive variables at Week 2 did not mediate the Week 9 framing effects on physical activity participation.",Using gain-framed messages exclusively may be a means of increasing the efficacy of physical activity materials.
1285,9881881,To measure the beta-carotene concentration in buccal mucosal cells in smoking men who had received long-term beta-carotene (BC) supplementation in a controlled trial. To assess the association of cellular BC on the prevalence of dysplasia in oral leukoplakia.,"An end-of-trial examination of a part of subjects in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study.343 men who for 5-7 years had received BC (20 mg/d) or alpha-tocopherol (AT) (50 mg/d), or both of these or placebo. BC concentration of buccal mucosal cells was compared in the subjects with BC supplementation (n = 173) to that of those without it (n = 170). Oral mucosae were examined clinically and lesions showing leukoplakia histopathologically.","Mean (s.d.) BC concentration in buccal mucosal cells was 7.7 (10.3)mg/kg protein in the subjects who received BC compared to 1.1 (1.7) mg/kg protein in those who did not. The BC concentration in the cells of supplemented subjects correlated with their serum BC levels (P &lt; 0.001). AT supplementation had no effect on BC concentration nor was daily amount of smoking statistically significantly associated with the BC concentration in buccal cells. Altogether 17 subjects showed oral leukoplakia, 7 had dysplasia. In these 7 subjects, the BC concentration in buccal mucosal cells did not differ statistically significantly compared to subjects with only hyperkeratosis (n = 10) (F-test, P = 0.74).","After long-term BC supplementation, BC concentration in oral mucosal cells was 7-fold greater than without supplementation. There was no evidence to support an association between cellular BC concentration and precancerous lesions among the few subjects having them in their oral mucosae."

When controlling for marital status, age, and age moved to the United States, the intervention group was nine times more likely to complete mammograms than the control group.",The culturally targeted educational program significantly increased mammogram use among Chinese immigrant women. Further testing of effectiveness in larger community settings is needed. The intervention may also serve as a foundation from which to develop education to increase cancer screening among other minority subgroups.

1288,30253746,"Hospitalized cancer patients undergoing intensive or high-dose chemotherapy often experience a considerable decline in functional performance associated with the increased risk of adverse health events. Exercises, particularly resistance-based exercises that may counteract this decline are restricted by therapy-related side effects. Since whole body vibration (WBV) is known to efficiently stimulate the neuromuscular system without significantly raising blood pressure, we hypothesize that especially WBV is particularly feasible even during intensive or high-dose chemotherapy (primary endpoint) and thus induces beneficial functional adaptations.","Twenty hospitalized patients with hematological malignancies scheduled for intensive or high-dose chemotherapy were randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) undergoing WBV, or an active control group (CG) cycling. Feasibility was determined by comparing the IG's and CG's training compliance. Furthermore, to assess feasibility, WBV-induced changes in chemotherapy-related side effects, blood pressure, and heart rate immediately after exercising were documented. To assess patients' functional performance, we measured jump height (cm), the duration (sec) of performing the chair rising- (CRT) and timed-up-and-go test (TUG), maximum power output during jumping and CRT (watt/kg) as well as sway path (mm) during balance tasks.","Training compliance was similar between groups (IG: median 62%, range 39-77; CG: 67%, 58-100; p\u2009=\u20090.315). Moreover, we observed neither the IG's reported side effects worsening, nor any increase in blood pressure after WBV. IG's jump height (+\u20092.3\u00a0cm, 95%CI 0.1-4.4, p\u2009=\u20090.028) and TUG performance (-\u20091.3\u00a0s, 95%CI -2.53 - -0.65, p\u2009=\u20090.027) improved significantly, while sway paths in semi-tandem stance were augmented after the intervention (eyes open: +\u200960\u00a0mm, 95%CI 2-236, p\u2009=\u20090.046; eyes closed: +\u200988\u00a0mm, 95%CI 49-214, p\u2009=\u20090.028). The CG's performances did not change over time. Maximum power output during CMJ and CRT and time during CRT did not change.","Our study is the first proving the feasibility of WBV during intensive/high-dose chemotherapy of hospitalized cancer patients. Additionally, WBV-induced neuromuscular adaptations resulted in functional benefits relevant to patients' autonomy. We believe that WBV can be implemented as an alternative training method during intensive chemotherapy, although the relative benefit compared to conventional resistance training requires more evaluation in future studies."
1289,29366911,Little research has explored coping skills practice in relation to symptom outcomes in psychosocial interventions for cancer patients and their family caregivers.To examine associations of coping skills practice to symptom change in a telephone symptom management (TSM) intervention delivered concurrently to lung cancer patients and their caregivers.,"This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized pilot trial. Data were examined from patient-caregiver dyads (n\u00a0=\u00a051 dyads) that were randomized to the TSM intervention. Guided by social cognitive theory, TSM involved four weekly sessions where dyads were taught coping skills including a mindfulness exercise, guided imagery, pursed lips breathing, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, emotion-focused coping, and assertive communication. Symptoms were assessed, including patients' and caregivers' psychological distress and patients' pain interference, fatigue interference, and distress related to breathlessness. Multiple regression analyses examined associations of coping skills practice during the intervention to symptoms at six\u00a0weeks after the intervention.","For patients, greater practice of assertive communication was associated with less pain interference (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.45, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and psychological distress (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.36, P\u00a0=\u00a00.047); for caregivers, greater practice of guided imagery was associated with less psychological distress (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.30, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Unexpectedly, for patients, greater practice of a mindfulness exercise was associated with higher pain (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.47, P\u00a0=\u00a00.07) and fatigue interference (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.49, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04); greater practice of problem solving was associated with higher distress related to breathlessness (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.56, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and psychological distress (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.36, P\u00a0=\u00a00.08).",Findings suggest that the effectiveness of TSM may have been reduced by competing effects of certain coping skills. Future interventions should consider focusing on assertive communication training for patients and guided imagery for caregivers.

At eight weeks, patients receiving therapy had significantly higher scores than control patients on fighting spirit and significantly lower scores on helplessness, anxious preoccupation, and fatalism; anxiety; psychological symptoms; and on orientation towards health care. These differences indicated improvement in each case. At four months, patients receiving therapy had significantly lower scores than controls on anxiety; psychological symptoms; and psychological distress. Clinically, the proportion of severely anxious patients dropped from 46% at baseline to 20% at eight weeks and 20% at four months in the therapy group and from 48% to 41% and to 43% respectively among controls. The proportion of patients with depression was 40% at baseline, 13% at eight weeks, and 18% at four months in the therapy group and 30%, 29%, and 23% respectively in controls.",Adjuvant psychological therapy produces significant improvement in various measures of psychological distress among cancer patients. The effect of therapy observed at eight weeks persists in some but not all measures at four month follow up.
1291,24646333,To examine the effects of an early postoperative walking exercise programme on postlobectomy lung cancer patients.Few interventional studies on the postoperative health status of lung cancer patients have considered the efficacy of programmes designed to improve critical health variables.,"A two-group quasi-experimental, longitudinal approach repeated four times examined participant data collected 12-18 hours prior to surgery and again at one, three and six months after surgery.We assigned the first 33 enrolled participants to the intervention group and the second 33 to the control group. The intervention was a daily supervised walking exercise programme consisting of 12 weeks of brisk walking exercise that began on the day following transfer to the regular ward along with weekly telephone calls until 12 weeks after discharge.

Compared to the control group, the intervention group earned significantly better values for FVC% at postoperative month 3 and for FEV1 % at postoperative months 3 and 6. Intervention group 6MWT scores were significantly better than those of the control group at postoperative months 1, 3 and 6.",This study demonstrated the benefits of an early postoperative walking exercise intervention for pulmonary and physical function in postlobectomy lung cancer patients.The results may guide the design of appropriate interventions in the future. Clinical trials in other populations are needed to confirm the results of this study.
1292,25856039,"Breast self-examination (BSE) may be beneficial for women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Therefore, these women are often advised to perform BSE. However, only 20% to 35% is performing BSE monthly, and proficiency levels are low. Recently diagnosed carriers are educated by a specially trained clinical nurse specialist (CNS) on how to perform BSE, as part of the yearly surveillance. Clinical nurse specialists are already commonly involved in breast cancer care. However, CNSs are not yet involved in the counseling of BRCA mutation carriers. The aim of this RCT was 2-fold: (1) to evaluate the feasibility of CNS-led BSE education (based on the Health Belief Model) as part of BRCA surveillance and (2) to evaluate the effects and feasibility of additional written information leaflets concerning BSE.","Thirty-seven female BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers were randomized into the intervention or control group. Women in both groups were educated about BSE by a specially trained CNS during the yearly visit to the outpatient clinic. The intervention group received additional written BSE instructions. After 3 months, 29 patients filled out a questionnaire, covering demographic characteristics, BSE behavior, and patient satisfaction.","The BSE frequencies did not significantly differ between both groups. A significant increase in the self-reported frequency of BSE after CNS-led education (P &lt; .001) was shown. Before the education, the main reason for not performing BSE was that women had felt unable to perform BSE (42.9%). Patient satisfaction with the CNS-led education was high.","CNS-led BSE education is feasible for the yearly breast surveillance of BRCA mutation carriers. In addition, a leaflet was shown to be useful as an additional source of information for patients.These results indicate that it is feasible to involve a CNS in the yearly surveillance of BRCA mutation carriers, which could be a solution for the continuous increased demand for care, while providing continuing high-quality care."
1293,9519139,To determine whether the behaviour of participants based on perception of treatment group in a randomised trial contributed to clinical outcome.,"A double blind randomised controlled trial of the effect of daily application of SPF 17 broad spectrum sunscreen cream (or placebo) on solar keratoses.A rural city in Victoria, Australia. Residents aged 40 years or over were invited by letter to attend for a skin cancer screening check. Of these, 588 people with between one and 30 solar keratoses enrolled in the trial and 431 completed the trial, which extended over a six month period that included summer. Participants' perceptions of their treatment allocation, adherence with the treatment regimen, adoption of other sun protection behaviours, side effects, and perceptions of change in condition were measured at two monthly intervals.","There were no significant differences between those who completed the study and those that did not for sex, age, treatment group, skin type, number of solar keratoses or correct perception of treatment group. Thirty per cent of those completing the study correctly guessed their treatment allocation, and people were just as likely to be right as to be wrong when they stated their opinion about their treatment allocation (z = 1.04; p = 0.15). Study group, skin type, amount of time spent outdoors, presence of side effects, perceptions of change in skin condition did not significantly predict correct perception of treatment allocation. Multivariate analysis of variance indicated that adoption of other sun protection and adherence with cream use were not significantly affected by actual treatment allocation, correct perception of treatment allocation nor by their interaction. Poisson regression analysis showed a significantly lower difference ratio of solar keratoses in the sunscreen group compared with the placebo base cream group (OR 0.55; CI = 0.46, 0.64), and for women compared with men (OR = 0.76; CI = 0.63, 0.93) but no independent effect of any of the indices of other sun protection or adherence.","A sufficient level of commitment to study procedures was achieved, so that trial participants did not adopt other behaviours that affected treatment outcomes. It is recommended that the potential threat to validity posed by the behaviour of participants be recognised at an early stage in planning of clinical trials, so that strategies to deal with this can be integrated into study protocols."
1294,15520425,"Colorectal cancer screening is underused, and primary care clinicians are challenged to provide patient education within the constraints of busy practices.To test the effect of an educational video, mailed to patients' homes before a physical examination, on performance of colorectal cancer screening, particularly sigmoidoscopy.","Randomized, controlled trial.5 primary care practices in central Massachusetts.938 patients age 50 to 74 years who were scheduled for an upcoming physical examination, had no personal history of colorectal cancer, and were eligible for lower-endoscopy screening according to current guidelines.Participants were randomly assigned to receive usual care (n = 488) or a video about colorectal cancer, the importance of early detection, and screening options (n = 450).Baseline and 6-month follow-up telephone assessments were conducted. A dependent variable classified screening since baseline as 1) sigmoidoscopy with or without other tests, 2) another test or test combination, or 3) no tests.","Overall screening rates were the same in the intervention and control groups (55%). In regression modeling, intervention participants were nonsignificantly more likely to complete sigmoidoscopy alone or in combination with another test (odds ratio, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.70]). Intervention dose (viewing at least half of the video) was significantly related to receiving sigmoidoscopy with or without another test (odds ratio, 2.81 [CI, 1.85 to 4.26]). Recruitment records showed that at least 23% of people coming for periodic health assessments were currently screened by a lower-endoscopy procedure and therefore were not eligible.",The primary care sample studied consisted primarily of middle-class white persons who had high screening rates at baseline. The results may not be generalizable to other populations. The trial was conducted during a period of increased health insurance coverage for lower-endoscopy procedures and public media attention to colon cancer screening.A mailed video had no effect on the overall rate of colorectal cancer screening and only modestly improved sigmoidoscopy screening rates among patients in primary care practices.
1295,14655916,"To examine the effects of a moderate-intensity exercise or stretching intervention and changes in fitness, body mass index, or time spent outdoors on self-reported sleep quality and to examine the relationship between the amount and timing of exercise and sleep quality.","A randomized intervention trial.A cancer research center in Seattle, Washington.Postmenopausal, overweight or obese, sedentary women not taking hormone replacement therapy, aged 50 to 75 years, and recruited from the Seattle metropolitan area.A yearlong moderate-intensity exercise (n=87) and a low-intensity stretching (n=86) program.","Among morning exercisers, those who exercised at least 225 minutes per week had less trouble falling asleep (odds ratio [OR]: 0.3, P &lt; or = .05) compared with those who exercised less than 180 minutes per week. However, among evening exercisers, those who exercised at least 225 minutes per week had more trouble falling asleep (OR: 3.3, P &lt; or = .05) compared to those who exercised less than 180 minutes per week. Stretchers were less likely to use sleep medication (OR = 0.4, P &lt; or = .05) and have trouble falling asleep (OR: 0.7, P &lt; or = .10) during the intervention period compared with baseline. A greater than 10% versus a 1% or less increase in maximum O2 consumption over the year was associated with longer sleep duration (P &lt; or = .05), less frequently falling asleep during quiet activities (P &lt; or = .05), and less use of sleep medication (P &lt; or = .05). Reductions in body mass index and increases in time spent outdoors had inconsistent effects on sleep quality.","Both stretching and exercise interventions may improve sleep quality in sedentary, overweight, postmenopausal women. Increased fitness was associated with improvements in sleep. However, the effect of moderate-intensity exercise may depend on the amount of exercise and time of day it is performed."
1296,15454357,Increased attention has focused on exercise as a quality of life intervention for breast cancer survivors during and after adjuvant therapy.Our objective was to examine the effects of an oncologist's recommendation to exercise on self-reported exercise behavior in newly diagnosed breast cancer survivors attending their first adjuvant therapy consultation.,"Using a single-blinded, 3-armed, randomized controlled trial, 450 breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to receive an oncologist exercise recommendation only, an oncologist exercise recommendation plus referral to an exercise specialist, or usual care. The primary outcome was self-reported total exercise (in metabolic equivalent [MET] hours per week) at 5 weeks postconsultation.","The follow-up assessment rate was 73% (329 of 450). Intention-to-treat analysis based on participants with follow-up data indicated a significant difference in total exercise in favor of the recommendation-only group over the usual care group (mean difference, 3.4 MET hr per week; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-6.1 MET hr per week; p = .011). There was no significant difference between the recommendation-plus-referral group and the usual care group (mean difference, 1.5 MET hr per week; 95% CI, -1.0 to 4.0 MET hr per week; p = .244). Ancillary &quot;on-treatment&quot; analyzes showed that participants who recalled an exercise recommendation reported significantly more total exercise than participants who did not recall an exercise recommendation (mean difference, 4.1 MET hr per week: 95% CI, 1.9-6.4 MET hr per week; p &lt; .001).","Our findings suggest that an oncologist recommendation may increase exercise behavior in newly diagnosed breast cancer survivors, particularly if it is recalled 1 week after the recommendation."
1297,18217532,"Virtual dialogue is a specific educational methodology that employs speech recognition, digital video, and computer technologies in a symbiotic relationship to allow users to have the illusion of a face-to-face conversation with a person in cyberspace. A voice-activated, interactive, virtual dialogue with a prostate cancer specialist was developed and tested in a clinical setting at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).The purpose of this study was two-fold: (a) to create a prototype virtual dialogue program on the subject of prostate cancer and (b) to evaluate the effectiveness of this method to educate men about their disease and treatment.",Participants were recruited using a convenience sample of patients attending the Center for Prostate Disease Research multidisciplinary clinic at WRAMC. An automated pretest and post-test instrument was developed by the investigators to assess patients' knowledge before and after the virtual dialogue session.,A total of 33 patients volunteered for the study. Results from this convenience sample showed an increase in patients' knowledge and positive acceptance of this innovative method of patient education.,The data resulting from this study provide persuasive evidence that a virtual dialogue with a knowledgeable health professional can be a useful and highly effective method for educating men about prostate cancer. This method may also offer an effective way for health professionals to systematically provide their patients with comprehensive and reliable information.
1298,15069024,To examine the impact on general practitioners' workload of adding nurse practitioners to the general practice team.,"Randomised controlled trial with measurements before and after the introduction of nurse practitioners.34 general practices in a southern region of the Netherlands.48 general practitioners.Five nurses were randomly allocated to general practitioners to undertake specific elements of care according to agreed guidelines. The control group received no nurse.Objective workload, derived from 28 day diaries, included the number of contacts per day for each of three conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, dementia, cancer), by type of consultation (in practice, telephone, home visit), and by time of day (surgery hours, out of hours). Subjective workload was measured by using a validated questionnaire. Outcomes were measured six months before and 18 months after the intervention.","The number of contacts during surgery hours increased in the intervention group compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.06), particularly for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (P &lt; 0.01). The number of consultations out of hours declined slightly in the intervention group compared with the control group, but this difference did not reach significance. No significant changes became apparent in subjective workload.","Adding nurse practitioners to general practice teams did not reduce the workload of general practitioners, at least in the short term. This implies that nurse practitioners are used as supplements, rather than substitutes, for care given by general practitioners."
1299,17500622,"To examine the longer term efficacies of exposure to UV photographs and photoaging information (e.g., wrinkles and age spots) for increasing sun protection intentions and behaviors of young adults.","Randomized controlled trial with 4- to 5-month and 12-month follow-ups.Participants' self-reported sun protection intentions assessed immediately after the interventions, and both self-reported sun protection behaviors and an objective assessment (via spectrophotometry) of skin color change measured at the end of summer (4-5 months following interventions) and 1 year following interventions.","Both interventions resulted in immediate positive effects on future sun protection intentions. Both interventions showed objective evidence of less skin darkening at the postsummer follow-up, with those in the photoaging information condition also reporting more sun protective behavior and continuing to show less skin darkening 1 year after intervention. There was also evidence that effects of photoaging information on subsequent skin color change were mediated by the earlier positive effect photoaging information had on participants' intentions to sun protect and their subsequent sun protection behaviors.",UV photo and photoaging-information interventions each show promise as a brief and relatively inexpensive approach for motivating sun protection practices that may reduce skin cancer risk.
1300,26908432,"We investigated the effect of equivalent weight loss, by a hypocaloric diet or mainly exercise, on inflammatory markers and adipokines in overweight postmenopausal women.","Women were randomized to a diet (n = 97), mainly exercise (n = 98), or control group (n = 48). Goal of both interventions was to lose 5 to 6 kg bodyweight by a hypocaloric diet or an exercise program (4 hours/week) combined with a small caloric intake restriction. Outcomes after 16 weeks included serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL6, adiponectin, and leptin.","Both intervention groups achieved the target weight loss. Controls remained weight stable. Compared with control, hsCRP decreased with mainly exercise [treatment effect ratio (TER) = 0.64] and borderline statistically significant with diet (TER = 0.77). There was a suggestively larger effect of exercise, directly compared with diet (TER = 0.83). Leptin decreased with both interventions: mainly exercise (TER = 0.55) and diet (TER = 0.59), versus control. Effects attenuated and lost significance after adjusting for change in body fat percentage, and to a lesser extent when adjusting for fitness. No effects were seen on IL6 and adiponectin.","A 16-week randomized intervention inducing comparable weight loss by a hypocaloric diet or mainly exercise, resulted in favorable effects on serum hsCRP and leptin. We found a possible more beneficial effect on hsCRP with mainly exercise versus diet. These effects of exercise were established by changes in body fat percentage and physical fitness.A modest amount of weight loss in postmenopausal women reduces hsCRP and leptin levels which might be associated with a lower breast cancer risk.

1301,29349712,"Advanced therapeutic strategies are often accompanied by significant adverse effects, which warrant equally progressive countermeasures. Physical exercise has proven an effective intervention to improve physical function and reduce fatigue in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in this population are not well established although HIIT has proven effective in other clinical populations. The aim of the OptiTrain trial was to examine the effects of concurrent resistance and high-intensity interval training (RT-HIIT) or concurrent moderate-intensity aerobic and high-intensity interval training (AT-HIIT), to usual care (UC) on pain sensitivity and physiological outcomes in patients with breast cancer during chemotherapy.","Two hundred and forty women were randomized to 16\u00a0weeks of RT-HIIT, AT-HIIT, or UC.","cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, body mass, hemoglobin levels, and pressure-pain threshold.Pre- to post-intervention, RT-HIIT (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.41) and AT-HIIT (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.42) prevented the reduced cardiorespiratory fitness found with UC. Handgrip strength (surgery side: RT-HIIT vs. UC: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.41, RT-HIIT vs. AT-HIIT: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.28; non-surgery side: RT-HIIT vs. UC: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.35, RT-HIIT vs. AT-HIIT: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.22) and lower-limb muscle strength (RT-HIIT vs. UC: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.66, RT-HIIT vs. AT-HIIT: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.23) were significantly improved in the RT-HIIT. Increases in body mass were smaller in RT-HIIT (ES\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.16) and AT-HIIT (ES\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.16) versus UC. RT-HIIT reported higher pressure-pain thresholds than UC (trapezius: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.46, gluteus: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.53) and AT-HIIT (trapezius: ES\u00a0=\u00a00.30).",Sixteen\u00a0weeks of RT-HIIT significantly improved muscle strength and reduced pain sensitivity. Both exercise programs were well tolerated and were equally efficient in preventing increases in body mass and in\u00a0preventing declines in cardiorespiratory fitness. These results highlight the importance of implementing a combination of resistance and high-intensity interval training during chemotherapy for women with breast cancer.
1302,8901854,"Experimental and epidemiologic investigations suggest that alpha-tocopherol (the most prevalent chemical form of vitamin E found in vegetable oils, seeds, grains, nuts, and other foods) and beta-carotene (a plant pigment and major precursor of vitamin A found in many yellow, orange, and dark-green, leafy vegetables and some fruit) might reduce the risk of cancer, particularly lung cancer. The initial findings of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC Study) indicated, however, that lung cancer incidence was increased among participants who received beta-carotene as a supplement. Similar results were recently reported by the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET), which tested a combination of beta-carotene and vitamin A.We examined the effects of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene supplementation on the incidence of lung cancer across subgroups of participants in the ATBC Study defined by base-line characteristics (e.g., age, number of cigarettes smoked, dietary or serum vitamin status, and alcohol consumption), by study compliance, and in relation to clinical factors, such as disease stage and histologic type. Our primary purpose was to determine whether the pattern of intervention effects across subgroups could facilitate further interpretation of the main ATBC Study results and shed light on potential mechanisms of action and relevance to other populations.","A total of 29,133 men aged 50-69 years who smoked five or more cigarettes daily were randomly assigned to receive alpha-tocopherol (50 mg), beta-carotene (20 mg), alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene, or a placebo daily for 5-8 years (median, 6.1 years). Data regarding smoking and other risk factors for lung cancer and dietary factors were obtained at study entry, along with measurements of serum levels of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene. Incident cases of lung cancer (n = 894) were identified through the Finnish Cancer Registry and death certificates. Each lung cancer diagnosis was independently confirmed, and histology or cytology was available for 94% of the cases. Intervention effects were evaluated by use of survival analysis and proportional hazards models. All P values were derived from two-sided statistical tests.","No overall effect was observed for lung cancer from alpha-tocopherol supplementation (relative risk [RR] = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.87-1.13; P = .86, logrank test). beta-Carotene supplementation was associated with increased lung cancer risk (RR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.02-1.33; P = .02, logrank test). The beta-carotene effect appeared stronger, but not substantially different, in participants who smoked at least 20 cigarettes daily (RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.07-1.46) compared with those who smoked five to 19 cigarettes daily (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.76-1.23) and in those with a higher alcohol intake (&gt; or = 11 g of ethanol/day [just under one drink per day]; RR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.01-1.81) compared with those with a lower intake (RR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.85-1.24).","Supplementation with alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene does not prevent lung cancer in older men who smoke. beta-Carotene supplementation at pharmacologic levels may modestly increase lung cancer incidence in cigarette smokers, and this effect may be associated with heavier smoking and higher alcohol intake.While the most direct way to reduce lung cancer risk is not to smoke tobacco, smokers should avoid high-dose beta-carotene supplementation."

Findings indicate neither group experienced significant increases in psychological distress at either follow-up assessment time points relative to baseline. Two weeks postintervention, the intervention group demonstrated a significant decrease in decisional conflict compared to the control group (t = 2.4, P &lt; 0.025) and a trend for a greater increase in knowledge about risk management options (t = 2.1, P = 0.037). No significant differences were found 6 months postintervention.",This form of educational material is successful in increasing knowledge about risk management options and in reducing decisional conflict in the shorter term. The decision aid is an effective and acceptable strategy for patient education to facilitate an inclusive and informed decision-making process about managing ovarian cancer risk.

The study included 3 diets: control, WB (12 g fiber/d), and WBRS (12 g WB fiber/d plus 22 g RS/d), each continued for 3 wk. In each diet, the major source of protein was lean red meat. During 5 consecutive days (days 15-19) of each dietary period, the subjects collected their total fecal output for analysis.","The WB diet resulted in greater fecal output (by 23% and 21% for wet and dry weights, respectively) and a lesser transit time (-11 h) than did the control diet but did not have major effects on fermentation variables. Compared with the control diet, the WBRS diet resulted in greater fecal output (by 56%) and a shorter transit time (-10 h), lower fecal pH (-0.15 units), higher fecal concentration (by 14%) and daily excretion (by 101%) of acetate, higher fecal concentration (by 79%) and daily excretion (by 162%) of butyrate, a higher fecal ratio of butyrate to total short-chain fatty acids (by 45%), and lower concentrations of total phenols (-34%) and ammonia (-27%).","Combining WB with RS had more benefits than did WB alone. This finding may have important implications for the dietary modulation of luminal contents, especially in the distal colon (the most common site of tumor formation)."

1306,28105576,"Cancer-related insomnia is associated with diminished quality of life (QOL), suggesting that improvement in insomnia may improve QOL in cancer survivors. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to improve insomnia, but less is known regarding its effect on QOL and whether improvement in insomnia corresponds to improved QOL. The present analysis examines the effects of CBT-I, with and without armodafinil, on QOL both directly and indirectly through improvements of insomnia.","This is an analysis of 95 cancer survivors for a specified secondary aim of a four-arm randomized controlled trial assessing the combined and individual effects of CBT-I and armodafinil to improve insomnia. QOL and insomnia severity were assessed before, during the intervention, at post-intervention, and 3\u00a0months later by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and Insomnia Severity Index, respectively.","Mean change in QOL from pre- to post-intervention for CBT-I + placebo, CBT-I + armodafinil, armodafinil, and placebo was 9.6 (SE\u00a0=\u00a01.8; p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001), 11.6 (SE\u00a0=\u00a01.8; p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001), -0.2 (SE\u00a0=\u00a03.2; p\u00a0=\u00a00.964), and 3.3 (SE\u00a0=\u00a02.0; p\u00a0=\u00a00.124), respectively. ANCOVA controlling for pre-intervention scores showed that participants receiving CBT-I had significantly improved QOL at post-intervention compared to those not receiving CBT-I (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001, effect size\u00a0=\u00a00.57), with benefits being maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Path analysis revealed that this improvement in QOL was due to improvement in insomnia severity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and Pearson correlations showed that changes in QOL from pre- to post-intervention were significantly associated with concurrent changes in insomnia severity (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.56; p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001). Armodafinil had no effect on QOL for those who did or did not receive it (p\u00a0=\u00a00.976; effect size\u00a0=\u00a0-0.004).","In cancer survivors with insomnia, CBT-I resulted in clinically significant improvement in QOL via improvement in insomnia. This improvement in QOL remained stable even 3\u00a0months after completing CBT-I.Considering the high prevalence of insomnia and its detrimental impact on QOL in cancer survivors and the effectiveness of CBT-I in alleviating insomnia, it is important that evidence-based non-pharmacological sleep interventions such as CBT-I be provided as an integral part of cancer care."

Thirteen failed to make a verified quit attempt on the predesignated date and were taken off study resulting in 24 evaluable subjects.Smokers completed clinic visits at a cancer center with interval telephone calls and mailings.Standardized SJW, 450 mg capsules taken orally twice daily along with cessation counseling messages.Subjects completed validated surveys and a focused physical examination at baseline. Evaluable subjects were defined as those subjects who made a confirmed quit attempt on their &quot;quit date&quot; 1 week following initiation of SJW. Smoking status was determined through self-report and bioverification using carbon monoxide (CO) testing.","Among evaluable subjects, the 12-week quit rate was 37.5% (9/24). Quitters had no significant change in weight from baseline to 12-weeks cessation. Use of SJW was generally well tolerated.","Based upon these results (which suggest that SJW may be effective in maintaining smoking cessation) and the high compliance and few AEs, we conclude that SJW demonstrates feasibility for use in smoking cessation. If SJW proves to be effective in larger controlled studies, it could represent a less expensive, more readily accessible and well-tolerated agent to promote tobacco cessation."
1311,25916660,"Treatment of prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is associated with an increased fat mass, decreased lean mass, increased fatigue and a reduction in quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month dietary and physical activity intervention for prostate cancer patients receiving ADT, to help minimise these side effects.","Patients (n = 94) were recruited to this study if they were planned to receive ADT for prostate cancer for at least 6 months. Men randomised to the intervention arm received a dietary and exercise intervention, commensurate with UK healthy eating and physical activity recommendations. The primary outcome of interest was body composition; secondary outcomes included fatigue, QoL, functional capacity, stress and dietary change.","The intervention group had a significant (p &lt; 0.001) reduction in weight, body mass index and percentage fat mass compared to the control group at 6 months; the between-group differences were -3.3 kg (95% confidence interval (95% CI) -4.5, -2.1), -1.1 kg/m(2) (95% CI -1.5, -0.7) and -2.1% (95% CI -2.8, -1.4), respectively, after adjustment for baseline values. The intervention resulted in improvements in functional capacity (p &lt; 0.001) and dietary intakes but did not significantly impact fatigue, QoL or stress scores at endpoint.",A 6-month diet and physical activity intervention can minimise the adverse body composition changes associated with ADT.This study shows that a pragmatic lifestyle intervention is feasible and can have a positive impact on health behaviours and other key outcomes in men with prostate cancer receiving ADT.
1312,30376857,"Physical activity (PA) is beneficial in improving negative physical and psychological effects of cancer and cancer treatment, but adherence to PA guidelines is low. Computer-tailored PA interventions can reach large populations with little resources. They match with patients' preference for home-based, unsupervised PA programs and are thus promising for the growing population of cancer survivors. The current study assessed the efficacy of a computer-tailored PA intervention in (four subgroups of) prostate and colorectal cancer survivors.","Prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors were randomized to the OncoActive intervention group (N\u00a0=\u2009249), or a usual-care waiting-list control group (N\u00a0=\u2009229). OncoActive participants received a pedometer and computer-tailored PA advice, both Web-based via an interactive website and with printed materials. Minutes moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and days \u226530\u00a0min PA were assessed with an accelerometer (ActiGraph) at baseline and 6\u00a0months. Further, questionnaires were used to assess self-reported PA, fatigue, distress, and quality of life at baseline, 3 and 6\u00a0months. Differences between both groups were assessed using linear regression analyses (complete cases and intention-to-treat). In addition, efficacy in relation to age, gender, education, type of cancer, and time since treatment was examined.","Three months after baseline OncoActive participants significantly increased their self-reported PA (PA days: d\u00a0=\u20090.46; MVPA: d\u00a0=\u20090.23). Physical functioning (d\u00a0=\u20090.23) and fatigue (d\u00a0=\u2009-\u20090.21) also improved significantly after three months. Six months after baseline, self-reported PA (PA days: d\u00a0=\u20090.51; MVPA: d\u00a0=\u20090.37) and ActiGraph MVPA (d\u00a0=\u20090.27) increased significantly, and ActiGraph days (d\u00a0=\u20090.16) increased borderline significantly (p\u00a0=\u2009.05; d\u00a0=\u20090.16). Furthermore, OncoActive participants reported significantly improvements in physical functioning (d\u00a0=\u20090.14), fatigue (d\u00a0=\u2009-\u20090.23) and depression (d\u00a0=\u2009-\u20090.32). Similar results were found for intention-to-treat analyses. Higher increases in PA were found for colorectal cancer participants at 3\u00a0months, and for medium and highly educated participants' PA at 6\u00a0months. Health outcomes at 6\u00a0months were more prominent in colorectal cancer participants and in women.",The OncoActive intervention was effective at increasing PA in prostate and colorectal cancer patients and survivors. Health-related effects were especially apparent in colorectal cancer participants. The intervention provides opportunities to accelerate cancer recovery. Long-term follow-up should examine further sustainability of these effects.
1313,29402572,To measure the impact of motivational interviewing (MI) on cancer knowledge and screening practice among first degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with colon cancer.,This randomized controlled trial targeted patients with colon cancer first to recruit their possible FDRs. Digit randomization of the eligible index patients into intervention or control groups resulted in allocating their belonging FDRs to the same study arm. FDRs (n\u202f=\u202f120) in intervention arm received MI counseling on phone by a trained oncology nurse and FDRs (n\u202f=\u202f120) in control group received standard generic information by a physician on phone. Primary outcome was the rate of documented colonoscopy in FDRs within six months after the baseline.,"A total of 227 FDRs were followed up, 115 in the intervention and 112 in the control group. At follow-up, the uptake of screening colonoscopy in the intervention group was 83.5% versus 48.2% in controls (crude odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-10.0, P\u202f&lt;\u202f.001).",This was the first randomized controlled trial in Iran that confirmed the efficaciousness of a phone-based MI counseling in improving colonoscopy uptake among family members of patients with colon cancer.Phone-based motivational counseling that involves trained nurses or health providers seems to be feasible approach in Iran health system and enhances screening for colon cancer.
1314,29847251,Concerns have been raised about both over- and underutilization of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in older patients and the need to align screening behavior with likelihood of net benefit.The purpose of this study was to test a novel use of a patient decision aid (PtDA) to promote appropriate CRC screening in older adults.,"A total of 424 patients ages 70 to 84 y who were not up to date with CRC screening participated in a double-blinded randomized controlled trial of a PtDA targeted to older adults making decisions about whether to undergo CRC screening from March 2012 to February 2015.Patients were randomized to a targeted PtDA or an attention control. The PtDA was designed to facilitate individualized decision making-helping patients understand the potential risks, benefits, and uncertainties of CRC screening given advanced age, health state, preferences, and values.","Two composite outcomes, appropriate CRC screening behavior 6 mo after the index visit and appropriate screening intent immediately after the visit, were defined as completed screening or intent for patients in good health, discussion about screening with their provider for patients in intermediate health, and no screening or intent for patients in poor health. Health state was determined by age and Charlson Comorbidity Index.Four hundred twelve (97%) and 421 (99%) patients were analyzed for the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively. Appropriate screening behavior at 6 mo was higher in the intervention group (55% v. 45%, P = 0.023) as was appropriate screening intent following the provider visit (61% v. 47%, P = 0.003).",The study took place in a single geographic region. The appropriate CRC screening classification system used in this study has not been formally validated.A PtDA for older adults promoted appropriate CRC screening behavior and intent.
1315,25986222,"Breast cancer chemotherapy is associated with a decline in measured cardiorespiratory fitness and increased fatigue. Physical activity has emerged as a feasible intervention to limit these side effects. Quantitative evaluation is necessary to propose a better-adapted physical activity and to evaluate efficacy.We undertook a prospective study to assess the effects of a home-based adapted physical activity (APA) program on aerobic capacity, strength, and fatigue in women treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer versus usual care.","This was an open two-arm, randomized controlled trial.Study included outpatient groups in the Department of Physiology and Medical Oncology of a hospital in France.Forty-four patients treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.Patients were randomly assigned to a control group or an APA group. Intervention consisted of a 3-week, home-based, supervised, combined APA program (endurance and resistance training) during 27 weeks. The primary endpoint was cardiopulmonary function assessed by maximal peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). Secondary endpoints included a 6-minute Walking Test (6MWT), and assessment of muscular strength, fatigue, quality of life, physical activity level, and anxiety/depression.","At 27 weeks, VO2peak increased by 1.83\u00b10.68 ml.min-1.kg-1 in the APA group (P=0.009) and decreased by 1.31\u00b10.65 mL.min-1.kg-1 in the control group (P=0.046). The difference between the two groups was not significant (2.26\u00b11.53 mL.min-1.kg-1, P=0.140) in intention-to-treat analysis, but it was significant in per protocol analysis (3.49\u00b11.64 mL.min-1.kg-1, P=0.049). At 27 and 54 weeks, no significant differences were observed between the two groups for the cardiopulmonary exercise test, 6MWT, quadriceps strength, or quality of life.","In breast cancer patients, a home-based supervised program during chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment may be safe, feasible and increase VO2peak. In this study, heavy evaluation tests explain patient's non-adherence and do not permit to obtain statistically significant results between APA and control groups.Aerobic home-based adapted physical activity is beneficial on aerobic capacity."
1316,18230015,"Based on theories regarding cognitive representations of illness and processes of conceptual change, a representational intervention to decrease cancer pain (RIDcancerPain) was developed and its efficacy tested.","A two-group RCT (RIDcancerPain versus control) with outcome and mediating variables assessed at baseline (T1) and 1 and 2 months later (T2 and T3). Subjects were 176 adults with pain related to metastatic cancer.Outcome variables were two pain severity measures (BPI and TPQM), pain interference with life, and overall quality of life. Mediating variables were attitudinal barriers to pain management and coping (medication use).",One hundred and fifty subjects completed the study. Subjects in RIDcancerPain (T1-T2 and T1-T3) showed greater decreases in Barrier scores than those in control. Subjects in RIDcancerPain (T1-T3) showed greater decreases in pain severity than those in control. Change in Barriers scores mediated the effect of RIDcancerPain on pain severity.,RIDcancerPain was efficacious with respect to some outcomes. Further work is needed to strengthen it.
1317,27716246,"It has been reported that higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammation play a key role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgery. Coenzyme Q10 is an endogenous lipid-soluble antioxidant. To date, no intervention study has investigated coenzyme Q10 supplementation in HCC patients after surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes activity, and inflammation levels in HCC patients after surgery following administration of coenzyme Q10 (300\u00a0mg/day).","This study was designed as a single-blinded, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled study. Patients who were diagnosed with primary HCC (n\u2009=\u200941) and were randomly assign to a placebo (n\u2009=\u200920) or coenzyme Q10 (300\u00a0mg/day, n\u2009=\u200921) group after surgery. The intervention lasted for 12\u00a0weeks. Plasma coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, oxidative stress antioxidant enzymes activity and inflammatory markers levels were measured.","The oxidative stress (p\u2009=\u20090.04) and inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and IL-6, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01) levels were significantly decreased, and the antioxidant enzymes activity was significantly increased (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.01) after 12\u00a0weeks of coenzyme Q10 supplementation. In addition, the coenzyme Q10 level was significantly negatively correlated with the oxidative stress (p\u2009=\u20090.01), and positively correlated with antioxidant enzymes activity (SOD, p\u2009=\u20090.01; CAT, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05; GPx, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and vitamin E level (p\u2009=\u20090.01) after supplementation.","In conclusion, we demonstrated that a dose of 300\u00a0mg/d of coenzyme Q10 supplementation significantly increased the antioxidant capacity and reduced the oxidative stress and inflammation levels in HCC patients after surgery."
1318,28086943,"The prognosis for men with non-aggressive prostate cancer is good, and several studies have investigated the impact of lifestyle changes including physical activity and diet on the prognosis. Despite positive results in animal studies and a few human interventions with whole-grain rye on markers of prostate cancer progression, the feasibility of trials investigating such dietary changes in combination with physical activity remains largely unstudied. The primary aim was to investigate the feasibility of an intervention with high whole-grain rye intake and vigorous physical activity for 6 months in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.","In total, 26 men (53-72 years) recently diagnosed with non-aggressive prostate cancer and on active surveillance, were enrolled in 2011-2012 and randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The intervention included 170 g/day of whole-grain rye and 3\u2009\u00d7\u200945 minutes/week of vigorous physical activity. The duration of the intervention was 6 months and end of follow-up 12 months after baseline. Clinic visits were scheduled at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline. Compliance with the intervention was evaluated by diaries, food frequency questionnaires, biomarkers, and heart rate monitor data. The effect of the intervention was evaluated by linear multiple regression analysis.","In the intervention group, the mean daily intake of whole-grain rye measured from diaries was 146 g (SD: 19) for the first 3 months and 125 g (SD: 40) for the last 3 months of the intervention. The median level (5 and 95 percentiles) of vigorous physical activity was 91 (17, 193) min/week for the first 3 months and 66 (13, 259) min/week for the last 3 months. No recordings of physical activity were done for the control group. Aerobic fitness (VO peak) increased in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention. No effects were found on other cardio-metabolic outcomes or prostate cancer progression.","The lifestyle intervention appeared feasible for 6 months among Danish men and the results are encouraging for conducting full-scale studies, where the impact of whole-grain rye and vigorous physical activity on prostate cancer progression and metabolic parameters can be evaluated."
1319,11019348,To determine if adult patients who received marrow transplants had faster resumption of oral energy and nutrient intake and shorter duration of intravenous (i.v.) fluid requirement if discharged from the hospital earlier than is customary.,"Randomized, controlled trial of patients remaining hospitalized because of inadequate oral intake. Consenting patients were assigned randomly to remain hospitalized (hospital group) or be discharged to an ambulatory setting (ambulatory group).Seventy-eight patients of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who were consuming less than 33% of estimated energy requirement and requiring up to 3,000 mL of fluids per day intravenously.Participants received nutrition counseling by a registered dietitian to promote resumption of oral intake. Daily oral intake records were analyzed to determine energy and nutrient content.Days after study enrollment to consume 33% of energy and protein requirements and total number of days of i.v. fluid support were analyzed by group until discharge from the center, approximately 100 days after transplantation.Demographic data were defined by group means. Differences between treatment procedures were determined by Cox regression analysis. No variables were confounding.","The hospital group took fewer days than the ambulatory group to resume oral energy intake (4.5 vs 8.0, P = .004) and to discontinue i.v. fluids (30.5 vs 48.5, P = .019). There was no difference between groups in days of parenteral nutrition support (P = .817) or days to resume oral protein intake (P = .470).","Oral and gastrointestinal complications delay resumption of oral energy and protein intakes after transplantation. Earlier hospital discharge can achieve cost savings but may delay resumption of oral energy intake. Because of continued high-risk nutrition status and potential for rapid change in medical status, nutrition assessment and counseling are necessary in both the hospital and ambulatory setting to promote resumption of oral intake and discontinuation of i.v. fluids."
1320,14601338,Women overestimate both population and individual risk of cervical cancer. This may contribute to the recognised excess screening frequency for low-risk women.To investigate whether an individualized risk communication package could affect stated preferences for screening interval and actual screening behaviour.,"Pragmatic, practice-based cluster randomised controlled trial.Twenty-nine practices (15 intervention, 14 control) in North Wales recruited 1890 women attending for cervical smears.A risk communication package containing visual material was compared with normal practice. Practice nurses received training in its delivery. The short-term primary outcome was stated preference for screening interval; the long-term primary outcome was actual screening behaviour.","In the short term, intervention arm women were significantly less likely to prefer a shorter than recommended interval (odds ratio [OR] = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.41 to 0.64; P &lt; 0.0001). At the five-year follow-up, fewer women in the intervention arm had attended for screening sooner than their recommended recall. The magnitude of difference in excess screening interval preference and behaviour was similar, but behaviour had a wider confidence interval and a marginally non-significant P-value (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.36 to 1.03; P = 0.063). Better knowledge and more accurate risk perceptions were demonstrated, with an improvement in measures of anxiety. The extra cost per woman receiving the intervention was 6 Pounds.","Women's perception of risk contributes to determining screening intervals in addition to practice factors. Simple risk information delivered in primary care affected women's stated preferences for tests. The impact on actual screening behaviour was more equivocal. Overall, the intervention showed a substantial benefit and any disbenefit can be ruled out. This approach to providing risk information could, at low cost, benefit other screening programmes and may relieve anxiety."
1321,17997260,This study evaluated a psychosocial screening intervention that offers cancer patients counselling. The assumption underlying the intervention was that barriers are often present that hamper patients' awareness of and active request for psychosocial care. An active yet unobtrusive approach was hypothesized to improve accessibility to psychosocial services.,"In a sequential cohort design, patients newly admitted to the oncology department of an academic hospital were assigned to a usual care group (n=50) or a screening group (n=79). A retrospective, medical records group (n=89) was also included. At baseline and 4 weeks following discharge, the usual care and screening groups completed mental health and quality of life questionnaires.","Half the screening group actually wanted and received counselling. At follow-up, the screening group reported significantly less pain, better mental health and better physical and role functioning than the usual care group.","The face-to-face screening intervention appears an effective means of identifying patients interested in obtaining formal psychosocial counselling, and may result in improvements in physical and mental health outcomes.This screening intervention may be particularly useful for hospitals that prefer a personal approach to psychosocial screening, but do not have sufficient resources to interview every new patient."
1322,20579837,Previous research has shown that the effectiveness of acupressure bands in reducing chemotherapy-related nausea is related to patients' expectations of efficacy.To test whether an informational manipulation designed to increase expectation of efficacy regarding acupressure bands would enhance their effectiveness.,"We conducted an exploratory, four-arm, randomized clinical trial in breast cancer patients about to begin chemotherapy. All patients received acupressure bands and a relaxation CD. This report focuses on Arm 1(expectancy-neutral informational handout and CD) compared with Arm 4 (expectancy-enhancing handout and CD). Randomization was stratified according to the patient's level of certainty that she would have treatment-induced nausea (two levels: high and low). Experience of nausea and use of antiemetics were assessed with a five-day diary.","Our expectancy-enhancing manipulation resulted in improved control of nausea in the 26 patients with high nausea expectancies but lessened control of nausea in 27 patients having low nausea expectancies. This interaction effect (between expected nausea and intervention effectiveness) approached statistical significance for our analysis of average nausea (P=0.084) and reached statistical significance for our analysis of peak nausea (P=0.030). Patients receiving the expectancy-enhancing manipulation took fewer antiemetic pills outside the clinic (mean(enhanced)=12.6; mean(neutral)=18.5, P=0.003).","This exploratory intervention reduced antiemetic use overall and also reduced nausea in patients who had high levels of expected nausea. Interestingly, it increased nausea in patients who had low expectancies for nausea. Confirmatory research is warranted."
1323,19003734,"Although a number of reports regarding the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the first step in cancer induction exist, few studies have investigated how vitamin C influences ROS in human plasma.Using the ROS assay system, a method recently established by one of the authors, we aimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin C supplementation on serum ROS among subjects diagnosed with chronic gastritis.",A total of 244 Japanese subjects with atrophic gastritis were randomized to take 5-year supplementation of either 50 mg or 500 mg of vitamin C.,"The adjusted difference in the changes of total ROS between baseline and after 5-year supplementation was statistically significant between the intervention groups: 2.70 decrease (corresponds to 1.26% decrease) in the high-dose group and 4.16 increase (corresponds to 3.79% increase) in the low-dose group, p for difference = 0.01.",Vitamin C was suggested to reduce oxidative stress among subjects with atrophic gastritis.
1324,9080890,"To examine whether older people were less able to distinguish changes of melanoma than younger people, and to test whether an educational brochure illustrating changes of melanoma would increase their ability to detect the changes.","Photographic images of pigmented skin lesions were altered using computer graphics software. Images of typical changes of melanoma were shown to groups of volunteers younger than 30 years (n = 52) and older than 45 years (n = 41). Short intervals (seconds) between viewing of the original and changed lesions were used to test ability to distinguish the changes, and longer intervals (29 and 60 days) were used to test their ability over more realistic intervals. All participants were randomized to receive an educational brochure (designed using the same technology) to evaluate whether this would assist in identifying early changes of melanoma.A cross section of volunteers employed in a large semigovernment utility.An educational brochure that illustrated typical changes of melanoma.Score of correct or incorrect detection of changed or unchanged skin lesions.",Tests at short intervals showed that both age groups were able to detect early changes of melanoma but had poor ability to detect changes of melanoma at longer intervals. Repeated viewing of the original lesions enabled the participants to once more recognize the changes. Both groups had low ability to detect the appearance of new pigmented lesions. The educational brochure improved the ability of participants to detect change.,The main difficulty people have in self-detection of melanoma is limited ability to recall the appearance of their skin. This ability did not differ between the age groups. Educational material that focused on change was effective in increasing the ability to detect changes over short intervals. Photographic records may be the most effective aid for detection of changes at longer intervals.

1328,11105182,"High-dose chemotherapy poses considerable challenges to emesis management. Although prior studies suggest that acupuncture may reduce nausea and emesis, it is unclear whether such benefit comes from the nonspecific effects of attention and clinician-patient interaction.To compare the effectiveness of electroacupuncture vs minimal needling and mock electrical stimulation or antiemetic medications alone in controlling emesis among patients undergoing a highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen.","Three-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial conducted from March 1996 to December 1997, with a 5-day study period and a 9-day follow-up.Oncology center at a university medical center.One hundred four women (mean age, 46 years) with high-risk breast cancer.Patients were randomly assigned to receive low-frequency electroacupuncture at classic antiemetic acupuncture points once daily for 5 days (n = 37); minimal needling at control points with mock electrostimulation on the same schedule (n = 33); or no adjunct needling (n = 34).

1329,10808985,"Computer technology has become an integral part of health care, yet there have been few studies exploring the use of multimedia technology in the prevention of cancer, especially targeting children.The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate a new multimedia computer program for the primary prevention of skin cancer among a childhood population.","An interactive CD-ROM program was developed, then pilot tested in a public elementary school in rural North Carolina. This intervention trial involved 8 third- and fourth-grade classes (N = 209 students), randomized into 3 groups: computer intervention, standard teacher-led intervention, and controls.Students were tested using pre- and postintervention surveys that measured knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors. A 7-month follow-up survey was performed.","There was a significant increase in postintervention knowledge for the computer group when compared to either the teacher-led or control groups (mean scores out of 100: 75.2, 59.5, 55.0, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Attitudes about suntanning demonstrated a significant difference between the 3 groups (mean scores out of 100: 64.0, 53.0, 48.6, respectively; p = 0.002). There were slight improvements in the behavioral scores, especially among the computer group, but the overall differences were not significant. Similar overall results were found for the long-term follow-up survey, except that attitudes about suntanning no longer demonstrated a significant difference.","These results indicate that this new educational tool is an effective way to introduce health education programs for young children in typical classroom settings. This prototype may serve as a model for the development of future preventive school-based programs, including applications to other conditions associated with high-risk behaviors among children."
1330,25411293,Elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations are a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. Lowering homocysteine with combined vitamin B-12 and folic acid supplementation may reduce fracture risk.This study [B-vitamins for the PRevention Of Osteoporotic Fractures (B-PROOF)] aimed to determine whether vitamin B-12 and folic acid supplementation reduces osteoporotic fracture incidence in hyperhomocysteinemic elderly individuals.,"This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 2919 participants aged \u226565 y with elevated homocysteine concentrations (12-50 \u03bcmol/L). Participants were assigned to receive daily 500 \u03bcg vitamin B-12 plus 400 \u03bcg folic acid or placebo supplementation for 2 y. Both intervention and placebo tablets also contained 600 IU vitamin D3. The primary endpoint was time to first osteoporotic fracture. Exploratory prespecified subgroup analyses were performed in men and women and in individuals younger than and older than age 80 y. Data were analyzed according to intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles.","Osteoporotic fractures occurred in 61 persons (4.2%) in the intervention group and 75 persons (5.1%) in the placebo group. Osteoporotic fracture risk was not significantly different between groups in the intention-to-treat analyses (HR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.21) or per-protocol analyses (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.21). For persons aged &gt;80 y, in per-protocol analyses, osteoporotic fracture risk was lower in the intervention group than in the placebo group (HR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.74). The total number of adverse events (including mortality) did not differ between groups. However, 63 and 42 participants in the intervention and placebo groups, respectively, reported incident cancer (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.31).","These data show that combined vitamin B-12 and folic acid supplementation had no effect on osteoporotic fracture incidence in this elderly population. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest a beneficial effect on osteoporotic fracture prevention in compliant persons aged &gt;80 y. However, treatment was also associated with increased incidence of cancer, although the study was not designed for assessing cancer outcomes. Therefore, vitamin B-12 plus folic acid supplementation cannot be recommended at present for fracture prevention in elderly people. The B-PROOF study was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (trialregister.nl) as NTR1333 and at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00696414."
1331,23017624,"Exercise benefits patients with cancer, but studies of home-based approaches, particularly among those with Stage IV disease, remain small and exploratory.To conduct an adequately powered trial of a home-based exercise intervention that can be facilely integrated into established delivery and reimbursement structures.","Sixty-six adults with Stage IV lung or colorectal cancer were randomized, in an eight-week trial, to usual care or incremental walking and home-based strength training. The exercising participants were instructed during a single physiotherapy visit and subsequently exercised four days or more per week; training and step-count goals were advanced during bimonthly telephone calls. The primary outcome measure was mobility assessed with the Ambulatory Post Acute Care Basic\u00a0Mobility Short Form. Secondary outcomes included ratings of pain and sleep quality as well as the ability to perform daily activities (Ambulatory Post Acute Care Daily Activities Short Form), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue).","Three participants dropped out and seven died (five in the intervention and two in the control group, P=0.28). At Week 8, the intervention group reported improved mobility (P=0.01), fatigue (P=0.02), and sleep quality (P=0.05) compared with the usual care group, but did not differ on the other measures.","A home-based exercise program seems capable of improving the mobility, fatigue, and sleep quality of patients with Stage IV lung and colorectal cancer."

Physicians recommended CRC screening for 61% of patients in the intervention group versus 41% in the control group (p = 0.08). Of those that received a recommendation, 90% in the intervention group adhered to it versus 26% in the control group (p = 0.007).","The intervention was successful in increasing rates of completed CRC screening primarily through increasing adherence after screening was recommended. Additional efforts should focus on developing new strategies to increase physician recommendation for CRC screening, while employing effective patient adherence interventions."
1333,10380385,"To examine changes in the psychosocial status of caregivers of post-surgical patients with cancer, and how their status was affected by (a) whether caregivers had physical problems of their own, and (b) whether the patient received a home care intervention. Many studies in this area to date have not included sufficient measurement points to identify fluctuations in psychosocial status over time. In addition, many have used caregiver health as an outcome rather than a predictor.","Longitudinal, randomized trial using a sample of 161 caregivers of cancer patients being treated at one large university hospital in the northeastern United States, 1993-1996. Half the patients were randomly assigned to receive a standardized home-care nursing intervention. The population of interest was caregivers of patients who were (a) diagnosed with a solid-tumor cancer within the past 2 months, (b) age 60 or older, (c) hospitalized for surgical treatment of the cancer and expected to live at least 6 months, and (d) had a complex problem at hospital discharge. All caregivers were living with the patient at time of discharge.Data were collected in structured interviews administered at the time of the patients' discharge and approximately 3 and 6 months later. Psychosocial status was measured using the Caregiver Reaction Assessment and the CES-Depression scale. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed for each psychosocial measure, using as factors Time (i.e., interview 1, 2, or 3), Group (treatment and control), and Caregiver Physical Problem.","Overall, psychosocial status improved from baseline to 3 months, and was about the same at 6 months. Among caregivers with physical problems, the psychosocial status of those in the treatment group declined compared to those in the control groups in the 3 months after discharge; an opposite pattern was observed in the following 3 months.","People who are caregivers for cancer patients and have physical problems of their own are at risk for psychologic morbidity, which may have a delayed onset. This delay may reflect the replacement of an initial optimism with discouragement as the reality of long-term illness sets in. Home care may create a situation in which caregivers are required to confront the realities of long-term caregiving quickly, cutting short their initial optimism, but also preparing them for what is to come."
1334,21467231,It is hypothesized that exercise can lead to a decrease in breast cancer risk through several hormonal and nonhormonal mechanisms. The WISER (Women In Steady Exercise Research) study investigated the effects of aerobic exercise on premenopausal sex hormone levels.,"Three hundred ninety-one sedentary, healthy, young eumenorrheic women were randomized either into an exercise intervention of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 5 times a week for approximately 16 weeks (n = 212) or into a control group (n = 179). Serum levels of estradiol, estrone sulfate, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), all in the midfollicular phase, and of progesterone, in the midluteal phase, were measured at baseline and at the end of the 16-week period.","Compared with the controls (n = 153), exercisers (n = 166) experienced significant increases in aerobic fitness, lean body mass, and decreases in percent body fat. There were no significant changes in body weight and menstrual cycle length between or within groups. Progesterone decreased significantly in exercisers; however, this reduction was similar to that of the control group. No significant changes between or within groups were found for any of the other sex hormones or SHBG.","In premenopausal women, 16 weeks of 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic exercise in young women did not significantly alter sex hormone or SHBG levels.Any favorable effects that moderate aerobic exercise without an associated weight change may have on breast cancer risk in premenopausal women are unlikely to be a consequence of changes in levels of sex hormones or SHBG."
1335,10632830,To assess the impact of informed consent on elderly patients' colorectal cancer (CRC) screening preferences.,"Randomized, controlled trial.Four general internal medicine practices.We studied 399 elderly patients visiting their primary care provider for routine office visits.Patients were randomized to receive either a scripted control message briefly describing CRC screening methods or one of two informational interventions simulating an informed consent presentation about CRC screening. One intervention described CRC mortality risk reduction in relative terms; the other, in absolute terms.","The main outcome measure was intent to begin or continue fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, or both. There was no difference in screening interest between the control group and the two information groups (p =.8). The majority (63%) of patients intended to begin or continue CRC screening. Informed patients were able to gauge more accurately the positive predictive value of screening (p =.0009). Control patients rated the efficacy of screening higher than did patients receiving relative risk reduction information, who rated it higher than did patients receiving absolute risk reduction information (p =.0002).","Elderly patients appeared to understand CRC screening information and use it to gauge the efficacy of screening, but provision of information had no impact on their preferences for screening. In view of the large proportion who preferred not to be screened, we conclude that elderly patients should be involved in the screening decision. However, factors other than provision of information must determine their CRC screening preferences."

1337,29471518,"Supportive music and imagery and music listening interventions have been effective in decreasing distress and improving mood in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, but it is unclear whether the two interventions differ in their treatment benefits. Furthermore, previous studies have not examined moderators to determine which subgroup(s) of patients may benefit most from each intervention.To examine the effects of supportive music and imagery compared with preferred music listening on responsiveness to music therapy, distress, anxiety and depression, and benefit finding. A secondary purpose was to explore sense of coherence and locus of control as potential moderators of intervention effectiveness.","A single-session, two-group comparative effectiveness randomized trial in two cancer centers. Patients were randomized to supportive music and imagery or preferred music listening during outpatient chemotherapy treatment. Data were collected at baseline and immediately after the 45-minute session. ANCOVA models were used to determine main effects of intervention as well as pairing potential moderators with group assignment to explore differences in intervention effects by moderator.",There were differential effects between the two interventions with the supportive music and imagery group scoring higher in responsiveness to music therapy and benefit finding. The music listening group scores indicated lower distress. The exploratory moderating analyses suggested Health Locus of Control-Internal and Sense of Coherence influenced intervention effectiveness.,"Music and imagery and preferred music listening experiences may serve different therapeutic purposes, access and activate different patient resources, and may be helpful at different stages of treatment."

1348,16467232,The hypothesis that a low-fat dietary pattern can reduce breast cancer risk has existed for decades but has never been tested in a controlled intervention trial.To assess the effects of undertaking a low-fat dietary pattern on breast cancer incidence.,"A randomized, controlled, primary prevention trial conducted at 40 US clinical centers from 1993 to 2005.A total of 48,835 postmenopausal women, aged 50 to 79 years, without prior breast cancer, including 18.6% of minority race/ethnicity, were enrolled.Women were randomly assigned to the dietary modification intervention group (40% [n = 19,541]) or the comparison group (60% [n = 29,294]). The intervention was designed to promote dietary change with the goals of reducing intake of total fat to 20% of energy and increasing consumption of vegetables and fruit to at least 5 servings daily and grains to at least 6 servings daily. Comparison group participants were not asked to make dietary changes.Invasive breast cancer incidence.","Dietary fat intake was significantly lower in the dietary modification intervention group compared with the comparison group. The difference between groups in change from baseline for percentage of energy from fat varied from 10.7% at year 1 to 8.1% at year 6. Vegetable and fruit consumption was higher in the intervention group by at least 1 serving per day and a smaller, more transient difference was found for grain consumption. The number of women who developed invasive breast cancer (annualized incidence rate) over the 8.1-year average follow-up period was 655 (0.42%) in the intervention group and 1072 (0.45%) in the comparison group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.01 for the comparison between the 2 groups). Secondary analyses suggest a lower hazard ratio among adherent women, provide greater evidence of risk reduction among women having a high-fat diet at baseline, and suggest a dietary effect that varies by hormone receptor characteristics of the tumor.","Among postmenopausal women, a low-fat dietary pattern did not result in a statistically significant reduction in invasive breast cancer risk over an 8.1-year average follow-up period. However, the nonsignificant trends observed suggesting reduced risk associated with a low-fat dietary pattern indicate that longer, planned, nonintervention follow-up may yield a more definitive comparison."
1349,20973811,"This paper is a report of a study analysing the effect of a home-based walking exercise program on symptoms and mood distress among breast cancer women receiving chemotherapy postoperatively.Treatment-related symptoms, mood distress and decline in physical activity have been identified as major complaints among cancer patients. Studies on the efficacy of home-based walking exercise for symptoms and mood did not fully describe the exercise prescriptions that could be safe and beneficial for women with breast cancer, especially these receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.","This is a prospective, randomized clinical trial. In 2008-2009, participants were recruited from the oncology outpatient clinic of a medical center in Taiwan, and were assigned to either the exercise group (n=19) or the control group (n=21). Women in the exercise group participated in a moderate-intensity home-based walking program for 12\u2003weeks during their chemotherapy treatments. Symptoms, mood status and physical activity level were measured at baseline, 6- and 12-week follow-up. Data were analysed by two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance.",Women in the exercise group reported significantly lower symptom severity scores and mood disturbance compared with those in the control group throughout the study period.,Regular moderate-intensity exercise can play an important role in improving treatment-related symptoms and mood in women with breast cancer. A home-based walking exercise program can be easily incorporated into care for women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.
1350,30485297,"Cancer related cognitive impairments have been subjectively reported and objectively detected in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and are known to have a profound negative impact on productivity, psychosocial well-being and overall quality of life. Moderate levels of walking are known to be of benefit to the psychosocial well-being of those affected by breast cancer and for managing cognitive impairment in healthy adults, children, and the elderly. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a home-based, self-managed, moderate intensity walking intervention on subjective and objective cognitive functioning in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.","A home-based, self-managed intervention that consisted of moderate levels of walking was compared to usual care among breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy in a randomised controlled trial. Outcome measures included changes in subjective (CFQ) and objectively detected cognitive functioning (Stroop, SART and two subscales from the WAIS- Digit Span and Block Design). Fifty participants were randomised to either the intervention group (n = 25), who completed 12 weeks of moderate intensity walking, or to the control group (n = 25) mid-way through chemotherapy.","Compared with the control group, the self-managed walking intervention had positive effects on perceived cognitive function but not on sustained attention, executive function, memory or visual spatial skills when assessed objectively using neuropsychological measures.","This home-based, self-managed intervention is beneficial for protecting against perceived cognitive decline in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. There is a need for further research to objectively assess cognitive decline within this population with larger sample sizes of patients."

Changes in barriers, benefits, and self-efficacy scores significantly predicted forward stage movement for women entering the study in precontemplation or contemplation (p = .0009, p = .037, and p = .048, respectively).","Changes in beliefs predict stage movement, and beliefs differ significantly among stages, leading the way for interventions tailored to both beliefs and stages of behavior adoption. In practical terms, we may be able to cut down on the &quot;bulkiness&quot; of our interventions and the number of tailoring variables, focusing more intensively on tailoring interventions to the beliefs whose changes have now been shown to predict stage advancement. These predictions are in addition to intervention effect which is reported elsewhere."

1356,10718895,"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) developed a manual to guide primary care practices in structuring their office environment and routine visits so as to enhance nutrition screening, advice/referral, and follow-up for cancer prevention. The adoption of the manual's recommendations by primary care practices was evaluated by examining two strategies: physician training on how to implement the manual's recommendations versus simple mailing of the manual. This article reports on the results of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of these two strategies.","A three-arm, randomized, controlled study.Free-standing primary care physician practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.Each study practice was randomly assigned to one of three groups. The training group practices were invited to send one member from their practice of their choosing to a 3-hour &quot;train-a-trainer&quot; workshop, the manual-only-group practices were mailed the nutrition manual, and the control group practices received no intervention. For training group practices, training was provided in the four major components of the nutrition manual: how to organize the office environment to support cancer prevention nutrition-related activities; how to screen patient adherence to the NCI dietary guidelines; how to provide dietary advice/referral; and how to implement a patient follow-up system to support patients in making changes in their nutrition-related behaviors.The primary outcomes of the study were derived from two evaluation instruments. The observation instrument documented the tools and procedures recommended by the nutrition manual and adopted in patient charts and the office environment. The in-person structured interview evaluated the physician and staff's self-reported nutrition-related activities reflecting the nutrition manual's recommendations. Data from these two instruments were used to construct four adherence scores corresponding to the areas: office organization, nutrition screening, nutrition advice/referral, and patient follow-up.","The adoption of the manual's recommendations was highest among the practices in the training group as reflected by their higher adherence scores. They organized their office ( P =.005) and screened their patients regarding their eating habits ( P =.046) significantly more closely to the recommendations of the nutrition manual than practices in the manual-only group. However, despite being the highest in compliance, the training group practices were only 54.9% adherent to the manual's recommendations regarding nutrition advice/referral, and 28.5% adherent to its recommendations on office organization, 23.5% adherent to its recommendations on nutrition screening, and 14.6% adherent to its patient follow-up recommendations.","Primary care practices exposed to the nutrition manual in a training session adopted more of the manual's recommendations. Specifically, practices invited to training were more likely to perform nutrition screening and to structure their office environment to be conducive to providing nutrition-related services for cancer prevention. The impact of the training was moderate and not statistically significant for nutrition advice/referral or patient follow-up, which are important in achieving long-term dietary changes in patients. The overall low adherence scores to nutrition-related activities demonstrates that there is plenty of room for improvement among the practices in the training group."

The intervention group experienced fewer breast cancer events than did the comparison group for all of the baseline quartiles. This difference was significant only in upper baseline quartiles of intake of vegetables, fruit, and fiber and in the lowest quartile of fat. A significant trend for fewer breast cancer events was observed across quartiles of vegetable-fruit and fiber consumption.",The secondary analysis showing the decreased risk in the HF- subgroup was not explained by amount of change in dietary pattern achieved. The difference was strongest in the quartile with the most putatively cancer-preventive dietary pattern at baseline.
1366,14503805,The components of psychoeducational interventions which are effective in reducing psychological distress are not well known.To examine whether increasing satisfaction with information provided by psychoeducational interventions is associated with reducing psychological distress.,"The subjects were consecutively selected from breast cancer outpatients surgically treated at the National Cancer Center Hospital East in Japan. We conducted a 6-week psychoeducational intervention in 44 women with primary breast cancer. Satisfaction with information was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale, and a hierarchical regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between psychological distress and patient satisfaction with the information provided.","Available data were obtained in 41 patients. At 6 months after intervention, increased satisfaction with information about breast cancer (p = 0.02) and methods for coping with cancer (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with lower total mood disturbance scores.","The results suggest that offering appropriate medical and psychological information in psychoeducational interventions might increase patient satisfaction with information, resulting in lower psychological distress."
1367,28437147,Radiation treatment for head and neck cancer introduces adaptive demands and subjects patients to significant and unique psychosocial challenges. There is growing evidence that meditation is useful in lessening anxiety and depression in cancer patients. This study compared the effects of two types of meditation training on the psychological responses of patients with head and neck cancer during radiation therapy.,"Randomized clinical trial.Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven.A total of 29 patients with head and neck cancers were recruited and 28 patients were followed during their radiation therapy over 12 weeks.Depending on their group assignment, patients were taught one of two standardized meditations: meditation with a coach or self-meditation with a CD.Patient psychosocial responses were defined as anxiety, depression, and emotional distress and were measured by the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and the Emotional Distress Thermometer. Measures were self-reported and collected by the nurse manager at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks during the patient's scheduled weekly visit.","No significant mean differences were found between the two meditation groups on all three outcomes: anxiety, depression, and emotional distress. Patients in both the meditation with a coach and self-meditation with a CD groups reported less distress from baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks, as evidenced by the HADS anxiety scale.","This study demonstrated two equally effective meditation techniques that can be implemented with patients experiencing high stress during radiation treatments in any health care setting to decrease patient anxiety, depression, and emotional distress. The data established self-meditation with a CD as a more cost-effective alternative to meditation with a coach, which requires intensive training and time commitment for patients."
1368,24578076,"To determine the feasibility of a standardized yoga intervention for survivors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, effects on sleep, mood, salivary cortisol levels, and quality of life (QOL).","This 14-week, one-group, repeated-measures study included a three-week preintervention phase, eight weeks of yoga classes (40 minutes once per week) and home practice, and a three-week postintervention phase. Follow-up occurred at three and six months poststudy.A community-based cancer support center in the midwestern United States.7 adults who had completed initial treatment for stages I-IIIa NSCLC.A standardized yoga protocol was developed prior to the study by experts in the field. Breathing ease was monitored before, during, and after classes to assess feasibility of movement without compromising respiratory status while doing yoga. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and salivary cortisol analysis.Sleep quality, mood, salivary cortisol, and QOL were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Profile of Mood States-Brief, a cortisol measurement, and the Medical Outcomes Survey SF-36\u00ae, respectively. Breathing ease was assessed using a dyspnea numeric rating scale as well as observation of participants.","Participants with varying stages of disease and length of survivorship were able to perform yoga without respiratory distress. Class attendance exceeded 95%, and all practiced at home. Mood, sleep efficiency, and QOL significantly improved; salivary cortisol levels decreased over time.","Yoga was feasible for NSCLC survivors without further compromising breathing with movement. Potential benefits were identified, supporting the need for future clinical trials with larger samples stratified by cancer stage, treatment, and length of survivorship.Nurses and healthcare providers should consider yoga as a mind-body practice to manage stress, improve mood and sleep, and potentially enhance QOL for NSCLC survivors."
1369,29909873,"Patient navigation programs to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening adherence have become widespread in recent years, especially among deprived populations.To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the first patient navigation program in France.","A total of 16,250 participants were randomized to either the usual screening group (n = 8145) or the navigation group (n = 8105). Navigation consisted of personalized support provided by social workers. A cost-effectiveness analysis of navigation versus usual screening was conducted from the payer perspective in the Picardy region of northern France. We considered nonmedical direct costs in the analysis.",Navigation was associated with a significant increase of 3.3% (24.4% vs. 21.1%; P = 0.003) in participation. The increase in participation was higher among affluent participants (+4.1%; P = 0.01) than among deprived ones (+2.6%; P = 0.07). The cost per additional individual screened by navigation compared with usual screening (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) was \u20ac1212 globally and \u20ac1527 among deprived participants. Results were sensitive to navigator wages and to the intervention effectiveness whose variations had the greatest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.,"Patient navigation aiming at increasing CRC screening participation is more efficient among affluent individuals. Nevertheless, when the intervention is implemented for the entire population, social inequalities in CRC screening adherence increase. To reduce social inequalities, patient navigation should therefore be restricted to deprived populations, despite not being the most cost-effective strategy, and accepted to bear a higher extra cost per additional individual screened."
1370,19155155,"Although patient education may enhance knowledge, coping with illness, and quality of life among cancer patients, it is uncertain which didactic method is most effective. We compared the impact of an interactive, patient-oriented group program to a lecture-based, information-only program in gastric cancer patients.","In this prospective, controlled trial, 121 gastric cancer patients attending inpatient rehabilitation after surgical treatment received either the interactive intervention or lectures providing information. The outcomes were patients' disease-related knowledge, active coping with illness, and quality of life (QoL) at the end of their stay and 6 and 12 months thereafter.","Both groups improved their knowledge and QoL during rehabilitation; however, knowledge was significantly higher in the interactive group compared to the lecture group. This difference was maintained at the 6- and 12-months follow-ups. In addition, the interactive group proved superior to the lecture group regarding active coping with illness and QoL at the end of rehabilitation, but not during follow-up.","A structured, interactive patient education program proved superior to lecture-based provision of information in regards to short-term and long-term knowledge as well as short-term coping and QoL.In gastric cancer patients, interactive patient education seems preferable over lectures."
1371,20501774,Adolescent diet is hypothesized to influence breast cancer risk. We evaluated the long-term effects of an intervention to lower fat intake among adolescent girls on biomarkers that are related to breast cancer risk in adults.,"A follow-up study was conducted on 230 girls who participated in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC), in which healthy, prepubertal, 8 to 10 year olds were randomly assigned to usual care or to a behavioral intervention that promoted a reduced fat diet. Participants were 25 to 29 years old at follow-up visits. All tests of statistical significance are two-sided.","In analyses that did not take account of diet at the time of the follow-up visit, the only statistically significant treatment group difference was higher bone mineral content in intervention group participants compared with usual care group participants; their mean bone mineral contents were 2,444 and 2,377 g, respectively. After adjustment for current diet, the intervention group also had statistically significantly higher bone mineral density and luteal phase serum estradiol concentrations. Serum progesterone concentrations and breast density did not differ by treatment group in unadjusted or adjusted analyses.","Results do not support the hypothesis that consumption of a lower fat diet during adolescence reduces breast cancer risk via effects on subsequent serum estradiol and progesterone levels, breast density, or bone mineral density. It remains unclear, however, if the results are specific to the DISC intervention or are more broadly applicable.Modest reductions in fat intake during adolescence are unlikely to lower later breast cancer risk via long-term effects on the biomarkers measured."

Participants were asked not to change usual diet.Total body fat, measured from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, was the primary outcome. Other measures included subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat from computed tomography scans, weight, and waist and hip circumferences.","Of 400 women, 384 provided baseline and follow-up adiposity measurements. Median (interquartile range) adherence at full prescription for the high- and moderate-volume groups was 254 (166-290) and 137 (111-150) min/wk, respectively. Mean reductions in total fat were significantly larger in the high- vs moderate-volume group (least-squares mean difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -1.6% to -0.4%], P\u2009=\u2009.002).

Intention to have a screen was predicted by knowledge level and anxiety (odds ratios: 1.10 and 0.70 respectively, both P's&lt;0.001).",The influence of an information leaflet appeared to have a positive effect on anxiety level and intentions to agree to receive an oral cancer screen.
1385,29681185,"Breast cancer (BC) requires a significant psychological adaptation once treatment is finished. There is growing evidence of how compassion training enhances psychological and physical well-being, however, there are very few studies analyzing the efficacy of compassion-based Interventions on BC survivors.To study the efficacy of the Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT) protocol in a BC survivor sample on quality of life, psychological well-being, fear of cancer recurrence, self-compassion, and compassion domains and mindfulness facets. Furthermore, enrollment, adherence, and satisfaction with the intervention were also analyzed.","A randomized clinical trial was designed. Participants (n = 56) were randomly assigned to CBCT (n = 28) or a treatment-as-usual control group (TAU; n = 28). Pre-post intervention and 6-month follow-up measures took place to evaluate health-related quality of life, psychological well-being; psychological stress, coping strategies, and triggering cognitions; self-compassion and compassion; and mindfulness in both intervention and wait-list groups.","Accrual of eligible participants was high (77%), and the drop-out rate was 16%. Attendance to CBCT sessions was high and practice off sessions exceeded expectations). CBCT was effective in diminishing stress caused by FCR, fostering self-kindness and common humanity, and increasing overall self-compassion scores, mindful observation, and acting with awareness skillsets.","CBCT could be considered a promising and potentially useful intervention to diminish stress caused by FCR and enhance self-kindness, common humanity, overall self-compassion, mindful observation, and acting with awareness skillsets. Nevertheless, future randomized trials are needed and a process of deeper cultural adaptation required."
1386,18347904,The 5 A Day for Better Health community studies demonstrated in randomized trials the efficacy of population-based strategies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption in diverse geographic areas and settings.Mediation analysis can help to elucidate the theoretical basis of changing dietary habits. This is important for informing more powerful cancer prevention and control interventions to achieve broad public health impact.,"Five sites that focused on adults were included in mediation analyses to determine whether theoretically derived constructs assessed at baseline and follow-up contributed to explaining change in fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) consumption. These variables were knowledge, self-efficacy, and autonomy/responsibility. Stage of change also was considered as a potential moderating variable.",Self-efficacy and knowledge of the 5 A Day recommendation increased in those who received the interventions and were positively associated with higher F&amp;V. Mediation of intervention effect was demonstrated for these variables. Autonomy/responsibility did not meet the criteria for mediation. There was no evidence of differential effect of mediators according to baseline stage.,The present study findings provide strong support for mediation of F&amp;V consumption by two variables: self-efficacy and knowledge. The authors discuss the findings in relation to study limitations and future research directions.
1387,28939343,"High levels of fatigue have been documented in ovarian cancer patients. However, increased levels of fatigue are positively associated with a high risk of sleep disturbance and depression.To investigate the feasibility of a nurse-led home-based exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy (E&amp;CBT) for ovarian cancer adults with cancer-related fatigue on outcomes of fatigue, plus other secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance and depression), either during or after completion of primary cancer treatment.","Randomized, single-blind control trial.Gynaecologic oncology department of the First Hospital of Jilin University in China.72 eligible women who recently had surgery and completed their first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to two groups.The experimental group received exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy. Five nurses with nursing master degree were trained to deliver this intervention. Patients received online interventions each week in the patient's place of residence or in the nurse-led clinic, as requested. Home visits, coupled with telephone-based motivational interviews twice a week were available with the permission of the participants. comparison group participants received services as usual.The primary outcome was measured by the Chinese version of the Piper Fatigue Scale that has 4 subscales (Behavior, Affect, Sensory, and Cognition). Secondary outcomes were measured using the Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire. Repeated-measure ANOVA was used to examine the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing fatigue, depression, and improving sleep quality.","For baseline comparisons, no significant differences were found between the two groups. After the interventions, total fatigue scores were significantly reduced from T1 to T2, to T3 in the experimental group (4.37, 4.24, 3.90), respectively. The comparison group showed almost no change in total fatigue score over time. In the repeated measures ANOVA, the differences of behavioral fatigue score (F=11.647, p=0.001) and cognitive fatigue score (F=5.741, p=0.019) were statistically significant for the group by time interaction. After the interventions, the experimental group participants demonstrated significantly lower symptoms of depression compared with the comparison group (T2: p=0.001 and T3: p&lt;0.001). Sleep duration, sleep dysfunction, daytime dysfunction as well as total sleep quality significantly improved.","Nurse-delivered home-based E&amp;CBT have measurable benefits in helping women with ovarian cancer to decrease cancer-related fatigue, depressive symptoms, and improving their quality of sleep."
1388,22521755,Prognosis for oral cancer is substantially improved when diagnosed early. This research aimed to evaluate an intervention to promote early presentation of oral cancer.,"Participants were randomly assigned to a leaflet group (n = 42), a one-to-one group (n = 46) or a control group (n = 24). Participants in the leaflet group read a theory-based (Extended Self-Regulatory Model; Social Cognitive Theory) leaflet on how to spot oral cancer early. Those in the one-to-one group received a brief, interactional discussion on early presentation of oral cancer and were then asked to read the leaflet. Participants in the control group received no information about oral cancer.","The leaflet and the one-to-one instruction led to more accurate knowledge of oral cancer, decreased anticipated delay, and increased understanding, likelihood and confidence to perform self-examination. Neither intervention raised participants' anxiety. There were minimal differences between the two interventions, yet both were superior to the control group.",This piloting indicates the initial effectiveness of an brief intervention purposefully designed for people at risk of developing oral cancer.A low cost intervention may be a useful tool to encourage early detection of oral cancer. This could be embedded into routine consultations or an early detection programme.

Data were collected from 2006 to 2008 and analyzed in 2007-2010.Of the 24 schools in the School District of Hillsborough County, Florida enrolled, 4th-graders were targeted in the first year and followed through their 5th-grade year.Classroom sessions were conducted to improve sun protection knowledge, foster more positive attitudes about hat use, and change the subjective norm of wearing hats when at school.Year-2 outcomes assessed included hat use at school (measured by direct observation), hat use outside of school (measured by self-report) and skin pigmentation and nevi counts (measured for a subgroup of 439 students).","The percentage of students observed wearing hats at control schools remained unchanged during the 2-year period (range 0%-2%) but increased significantly at intervention schools (2% at baseline, 41% at end of Year 1, 19% at end of Year 2; p&lt;0.001 for intervention effect). Measures of skin pigmentation, nevi counts, and self-reported use of hats outside of school did not change during the study period.",This intervention increased use of hats at school through Year 2 but had no measurable effect on skin pigmentation or nevi. Whether school-based interventions can ultimately prevent skin cancer is uncertain.

The results suggest that patient navigation for mammography screening should focus on women who are not up to date on their screening.
1391,7707420,"Studies have shown that a majority of women with a family history of breast cancer have exaggerated perceptions of their own risk of this disease and experience excessive anxiety. In response to the need to communicate more accurate risk information to these women, specialized programs for breast cancer risk counseling have been initiated in medical centers across the United States.Our purpose was 1) to evaluate the impact of a standardized protocol for individualized breast cancer risk counseling on comprehension of personal risk among first-degree relatives of index breast cancer patients and 2) to identify women most and least likely to benefit from such counseling.",This study is a prospective randomized trial comparing individualized breast cancer risk counseling to general health counseling (control). We studied 200 women aged 35 years and older who had a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative. Women with a personal history of cancer were excluded. Risk comprehension was assessed as the concordance between perceived &quot;subjective&quot; lifetime breast cancer risk and estimated &quot;objective&quot; lifetime risk.,"The results of logistic regression analysis showed that women who received risk counseling were significantly more likely to improve their risk comprehension, compared with women in the control condition (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-9.5; P = .01). However, in both groups, about two thirds of women continued to overestimate their lifetime risks substantially following counseling. Examination of subjects by treatment interaction effects indicated that risk counseling did not produce improved comprehension among the large proportion of women who had high levels of anxious preoccupation with breast cancer at base line (P = .02). In addition, white women were less likely to benefit than African-American women (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.11-0.99; P = .05).","Efforts to counsel women about their breast cancer risks are not likely to be effective unless their breast cancer anxieties are also addressed.Attention to the psychological aspects of breast cancer risk will be critical in the development of risk-counseling programs that incorporate testing for the recently cloned breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1 (and BRCA2 when that gene has also been cloned)."

1394,24969260,To compare the effectiveness of two low-intensity approaches for distressed patients with cancer and caregivers who had called cancer helplines seeking support. Baseline distress was hypothesized as a moderator of intervention effect.,"Randomized trial.Community-based cancer helplines in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia.354 patients with cancer and 336 caregivers.Participants were randomized to either a single session of nurse-led self-management intervention or a five-session psychologist cognitive behavioral intervention delivered by telephone. Assessments were undertaken at baseline (preintervention) and at 3, 6, and 12 months.Psychological and cancer-specific distress and post-traumatic growth.","No significant moderation by baseline cancer-specific distress was noted. For low-education patients, only the psychologist intervention was associated with a significant drop in distress. For all other participants, distress decreased over time in both arms with small to large effect sizes (Cohen's ds = 0.05-0.82). Post-traumatic growth increased over time for all participants (Cohen's ds = 0.6-0.64).",Many distressed patients with cancer and their caregivers may benefit significantly from a single session of a nurse psychoeducation intervention that can be delivered remotely by telephone and supported by self-management materials. Research is needed to develop an algorithm that moves beyond the use of distress as the only indicator for referral to specialist psychological services. Survivors and caregivers with low education and low literacy may require more in-depth and targeted support.Brief nurse psychoeducation and stress management for cancer survivors and caregivers should be considered as part of a tiered approach to psychosocial care.
1395,18670888,"Today, the 5-year relative survival rate for cancer is 65% and there are 10.5 million survivors. The largest group of survivors are those of breast cancer. Reductions in mortality are occurring at a greater rate for women under age 50 at diagnosis than among older women.Our goal was to design a socio-educational intervention for 5-year survivors aged 50 or younger at diagnosis and test the hypotheses that women in the intervention group would show greater improvement than controls with respect to (1) knowledge of breast cancer, its treatment, and long-term health concerns; (2) lifestyle habits (i.e., exercise and diet); and (3) communication with family and physicians.","Using a randomized controlled trial with a pre-post design, 404 women who were 5 years from diagnosis and cancer-free (response rate 54%) were randomly assigned to an intervention or delayed intervention (control) group and were assessed at pre-test (baseline) and 6 months later (96% retention). The intervention consisted of three 6-h workshops over a 3 month period. Four series of workshops were held at different geographical areas in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. The workshops included activities and information to promote physical, social, emotional, and spiritual well-being. The intervention design was based on findings from focus groups and a survey of 185 cancer-free 5-year survivors that assessed changes since the early months after diagnosis in physical, social, emotional, and spiritual concerns (response rate 73%).","Consistent with our first hypothesis, at post-test, women in the intervention group, on average, had greater knowledge regarding breast cancer, its treatment, and their own future health than did those in the control group (p = 0.015). Hypothesis 2 was partially supported as women in the intervention group were more likely than the control group to report an increased amount of physical activity (p = 0.036), but not significant dietary changes. Social support was related to increased self report of physical activity. With the exception of the last series of workshops, the intervention group did not report improved communications with family, friends, and physicians (hypothesis 3).","A short-term intervention can affect knowledge levels and physical activity but not diet or communication in the family.The intervention was related to greater knowledge related to breast cancer, and increased report of physical activity. The program was not related to changes in reported diet or family communication."

No statistical differences in QOL, aerobic capacity, or shoulder flexibility were found, but trends favoring Nia were identified.","For women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer, Nia can help relieve fatigue. Additional research in arm and shoulder mobility and preservation also may be beneficial.Oncology nurses are in a unique position to offer suggestions to help manage fatigue, and Nia could be considered as part of a cancer survivorship program.Exercise is beneficial for women with breast cancer, and interest is growing in nontraditional exercise options. Nia can benefit women with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy."

1399,27511906,Dysphagia is common in head and neck cancer patients after concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). This study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a randomized sham-controlled trial and collected preliminary data on safety and efficacy of acupuncture.,Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients with stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma were randomized to 12 sessions of either active acupuncture (AA) or sham acupuncture (SA) during and following CRT. Patients were blinded to treatment assignment. Swallowing-related quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) total and subscale scores.,"Multiple aspects of trial feasibility were confirmed. Forty-two of 196 patients screened (21%) were enrolled and randomized to receive AA (n = 21) or SA (n = 21); 79% completed at least 10 of 12 planned acupuncture sessions; 81% completed the study follow-ups. The majority of patients reported uncertainty regarding their treatment assignment, with no difference between the AA and SA groups. Audits confirmed both AA and SA treatments were delivered with high fidelity. No serious acupuncture-related side effects were observed. MDADI total scores significantly improved from baseline to 12 months post-CRT in both groups (AA: +7.9; SA +13.9; p = .044, p &lt; .001). Similar patterns were observed for the MDADI global subscale (AA: +25.0; SA +22.7; p = .001, p = .002). Intent-to-treat analyses suggested no difference between the treatment groups (p = .17, p = .76 for MDADI total and global scores, respectively).","A sham-controlled randomized trial evaluating acupuncture in dysphagia-related QOL in HNC found the procedure to be feasible and safe. Further investigation is required to evaluate efficacy.Dysphagia or swallowing difficulty is an important and common condition after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in head and neck cancer patients. In addition to current available supportive care, acupuncture may offer potential for treating dysphagia. This study demonstrated that both active acupuncture and sham acupuncture are safe and were associated with improved dysphagia-related quality of life from baseline to 12 months after concurrent chemoradiation therapy. This study was not designed to inform underlying specific versus nonspecific effects. Future larger-scale pragmatic clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of acupuncture versus standard of care are warranted, and further mechanistic research is needed to understand how active versus purportedly sham acupuncture procedures affect dysphagia-related symptoms."
1400,21147860,"Epidemiologic data have shown that obesity independently increases colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Obesity is an inflammatory state, and chronic colonic inflammation induces CRC.We conducted this proof-of-principle study to seek evidence of obesity-associated colorectal inflammation and to evaluate effects of diet-induced weight loss.","We measured inflammatory cytokines, gene arrays, and macrophage infiltration in rectosigmoid mucosal biopsies of 10 obese premenopausal women [mean \u00b1 SD body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 35 \u00b1 3.5] before and after weight loss induced by a very-low-calorie diet.","Subjects lost a mean (\u00b1SD) of 10.1 \u00b1 1% of their initial weight. Weight loss significantly reduced fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin (IL)-8 concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). After weight loss, rectosigmoid biopsies showed a 25-57% reduction in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). T cell and macrophage counts decreased by 28% and 42%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Gene arrays showed dramatic down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine pathways, prostaglandin metabolism, and the transcription factors STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and nuclear transcription factor \u03baB. Weight loss reduced expression of FOS and JUN genes and down-regulated oxidative stress pathways and the transcription factors ATF (activating transcription factor) and CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding).",Our data show that diet-induced weight loss in obese individuals reduces colorectal inflammation and greatly modulates inflammatory and cancer-related gene pathways. These data imply that obesity is accompanied by inflammation in the colorectal mucosa and that diet-induced weight loss reduces this inflammatory state and may thereby lower CRC risk.
1401,17673094,"Professional organizations recommend that physicians discuss prostate cancer with patients to make individual screening decisions. However, few studies have tested strategies to encourage such discussions, particularly among high-risk populations. We examined the effects of two low-literacy interventions on the frequency of prostate cancer discussion and screening.","Randomized, blinded, controlled trial with concealed allocation.Inner-city primary care clinic, serving a predominately African-American population. Participants were men aged 45-70 with no history of prostate cancer, presenting for a regular appointment.While waiting to see their physician, patients received a patient education handout on prostate cancer screening (PtEd), a handout simply encouraging patients to talk to their doctor about prostate cancer (Cue), or a control handout. The interventions did not advocate for or against screening.Patient-reported discussion of prostate cancer with the physician and chart reviews determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test orders and performance of digital rectal examination (DRE). Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. Data were collected in 2003, and analyses were completed in 2006.","Most of the 250 subjects (90.4%) were African American and 78.8% read below the ninth grade level. Overall, 48.4% reported discussing prostate cancer during the appointment. Compared to the control group (37.3%), discussions were significantly more common in the Cue group (58.0%, aOR=2.39 [1.26-4.52]), as well as in the PtEd group (50.0%, aOR=1.92 [1.01-3.65]). When prostate cancer was discussed, patients in the intervention groups more commonly initiated the conversation (47.6% PtEd and 40.0% Cue, vs 9.7% control, p&lt;0.01 for each comparison to control). Compared to the control group (2.4%), PSA test orders increased in the PtEd group (14.1%, aOR=7.62 [1.62-35.83]) and in the Cue group (12.3%, aOR=5.86 [1.24-27.81]). Documentation of DRE did not change significantly (4.7% PtEd, 6.2% Cue, and 6.0% control).",Two simple low-literacy interventions significantly increased discussion of prostate cancer and PSA test orders but not performance of DRE. Both interventions were effective in empowering low-literacy patients to initiate conversations about prostate cancer with their physician.
1402,24372367,To evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of a psycho-educational intervention designed to improve effective coping and reduce symptom severity in children with cancer.Cancer treatments increase survival rates and also cause physical and psychological effects on children with cancer. A psycho-educational intervention is used to assist children and adolescents with these effects and its efficacy has been described in several studies.,"A randomized controlled trial.Participants being treated were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups from September 2011-February 2013 in Taiwan. The intervention group received a psycho-educational intervention in addition to standard care, while the control group received only standard care. Each participant was assessed using a paediatric cancer coping scale and perceived symptom severity was evaluated at three time points (baseline, 1 month and 3 months). A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to estimate the effects of intervention. Qualitative findings were analysed using content analysis.","No significant difference in coping scores was found between groups, but the experimental group reported significantly lower scores in gastrointestinal problems and pain. Most symptoms decreased significantly over time in both groups, except for gastrointestinal problems. The scores in pain, bone marrow suppression and body image showed significant interaction effects between groups on changes over time. Qualitative results reported that participants evaluated the intervention positively, especially about receipt of psychological support and learnt coping skills.",The psycho-educational intervention administered was acceptable for children with cancer and was found to reduce gastrointestinal problems and pain.
1403,16400064,"Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases related to aging such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Carotenoids could be a part of a protective strategy to minimize oxidative damage in vulnerable populations, such as the elderly.Our aim was to determine the protective effect of carotenoids against DNA damage.","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study was conducted. Thirty-seven healthy, nonsmoking postmenopausal women aged 50-70 y were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups and were instructed to consume a daily dose of mixed carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene; 4 mg each), 12 mg of a single carotenoid (beta-carotene, lutein, or lycopene), or placebo for 56 d. Plasma carotenoid concentrations were analyzed by using HPLC, and lymphocyte DNA damage was measured by using a single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay.","At day 57, all carotenoid-supplemented groups showed significantly lower endogenous DNA damage than at baseline (P &lt; 0.01), whereas the placebo group did not show any significant change. Significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) endogenous DNA damage was found as early as day 15 in the mixed carotenoid (P &lt; 0.01) and beta-carotene (P &lt; 0.05) groups.","The results indicate that carotenoid supplementation decreases DNA damage and that a combination of carotenoids (4 mg each of lutein, beta-carotene, and lycopene), an intake that can be achieved by diet, or a larger dose (12 mg) of individual carotenoids exerts protection against DNA damage."
1404,21606094,"Patient navigators may increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among adults in underserved communities, but prior randomized trials have been small or conducted at single sites and have not included substantial numbers of Haitian Creole-speaking or Portuguese-speaking patients.","We identified 465 primary care patients from 4 community health centers and 2 public hospital-based clinics who were not up-to-date with CRC screening and spoke English, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, or Spanish as their primary language. We enrolled participants from September 1, 2008, through March 31, 2009, and followed them up for 1 year after enrollment. We randomly allocated patients to receive a patient navigation-based intervention or usual care. Intervention patients received an introductory letter from their primary care provider with educational material, followed by telephone calls from a language-concordant navigator. The navigators offered patients the option of being screened by fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. The primary outcome was completion of any CRC screening within 1 year. Secondary outcomes included the proportions of patients screened by colonoscopy who had adenomas or cancer detected.","During a 1-year period, intervention patients were more likely to undergo CRC screening than control patients (33.6% vs 20.0%; P &lt; .001), to be screened by colonoscopy (26.4% vs 13.0%; P &lt; .001), and to have adenomas detected (8.1% vs 3.9%; P = .06). In prespecified subgroup analyses, the navigator intervention was particularly beneficial for patients whose primary language was other than English (39.8% vs 18.6%; P &lt; .001) and black patients (39.7% vs 16.7%; P = .004).",Patient navigation increased completion of CRC screening among ethnically diverse patients. Targeting patient navigation to black and non-English-speaking patients may be a useful approach to reducing disparities in CRC screening.
1405,25542552,"Many physicians avoid advance care planning (ACP) discussions because they worry such conversations will lead to psychological distress.To investigate whether engaging in ACP using online planning tools adversely affects hope, hopelessness, or anxiety among patients with advanced cancer.","Patients with advanced cancer and an estimated survival of two years or less (Intervention group) and a Control group were recruited at a tertiary care academic medical center (2007-2012) to engage in ACP using an online decision aid (&quot;Making Your Wishes Known&quot;). Pre/post and between-group comparisons were made, including hope (Herth Hope Index), hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale), and anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory). Secondary outcomes included ACP knowledge, self-determination, and satisfaction.","A total of 200 individuals completed the study. After engaging in ACP, there was no decline in hope or increase in hopelessness in either the Control or Intervention group. Anxiety was likewise unchanged in the Control group but decreased slightly in the Intervention group. Knowledge of ACP (% correct answers) increased in both the groups, but more so in the Intervention group (13% increase vs. 4%; P&lt;0.01). Self-determination increased slightly in both groups, and satisfaction with the ACP process was greater (P&lt;0.01) in the Intervention than Control group.","Engaging in ACP with online planning tools increases knowledge without diminishing hope, increasing hopelessness, or inducing anxiety in patients with advanced cancer. Physicians need not avoid ACP out of concern for adversely affecting patients' psychological well-being."
1406,20697267,"In Western culture, evidence has shown that in women with breast cancer exercise decreases fatigue and improves quality of life. However, only 1 pilot study about the effect of exercise has been examined in the Asian breast cancer population that indicated feasibility. Therefore, it is important to further study the effect of an exercise program for Taiwanese women with breast cancer.The purpose of this study was to test the effects of a walking program on Taiwanese women newly diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.","This was an experimental, longitudinal study with 4-time repeated measures based on Bandura's Self-efficacy Theory, with the aim of implementing interventions to boost exercise self-efficacy and to evaluate research outcomes. SPSS 17.0 with descriptive statistics using frequency, percentage, mean, and SD as well as inferential statistics such as t test, \u03c7 test, hierarchical linear model, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance was used for data analysis.","Results of this study indicated that subjects in the exercise group had significantly better quality of life, less fatigue, less sleep disturbances, higher exercise self-efficacy, more exercise behavior, and better exercise capacity compared with those in the usual-care group after the intervention.","This program was effective and feasible, but more research studies with experimental, longitudinal design to verify the effects of this exercise program on Taiwanese women with breast cancer will be needed.Nurses, depending on skill and knowledge, can encourage physical activity, refer patients to rehabilitation programs, and prescribe and monitor exercise in breast cancer population."

DATA SOURCE FOR EFFECTIVENESS: Randomized trial of three strategies conducted at Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound (GHC).Women 50 to 79 years of age who were enrolled in GHC's breast cancer screening program who did not schedule screening mammography within 2 months after it was recommended by letter.Marginal cost-effectiveness of each additional woman screened.,"Because of its high cost (about $26 per call) and intermediate effectiveness, the motivational call was the least cost-effective strategy. If it was assumed that 50% of the women who scheduled mammography after receiving the reminder postcard would have scheduled mammography within 10 months even without it, marginal cost-effectiveness for the postcard among all women was $22 per woman screened versus $92 for the reminder call. Among women with no previous mammography, the marginal cost-effectiveness for the postcard was $70 versus $100 for the reminder call.Among women with no previous mammography, the choice between the reminder postcard and the reminder call was sensitive to assumptions about the percentage of women expected to receive mammography in the absence of other promotional strategies.",Health plan.A simple reminder postcard is the most cost-effective way to increase mammography. Choices about how to promote mammography will ultimately depend on plan values and willingness to invest in promotional strategies that increase participation at higher unit costs.
1408,25010250,Decision aids provide balanced information about the benefits and risks of treatment options and improve the match between patient preferences and the treatment received.To assess the impact of a decision aid regarding the treatment options for patients with localized prostate cancer.,"A 2-arm randomized controlled trial was used to compare booklet patient decision aid (intervention group n = 61) with standard information for localized prostate cancer (control group n = 61). The study was conducted at 3 hospitals between 2011 and 2013. The main outcome measures were knowledge, decisional conflict, satisfaction with the decision-making process, and coping.",The respective mean Decisional Conflict Scale scores before and after the intervention were 53.0 \u00b1 16.9 and 31.2 \u00b1 10.2 in the intervention group and 49.1 \u00b1 13.7 and 51.7 \u00b1 13.3 in the control group (P &lt; .001).

Finally, the video group rated their education vehicle more useful and appealing than the pamphlet group (p&lt;0.001), and video group participants referred to the video more frequently (p=0.018).","Video-based learning is a more effective educational tool for teaching sun protective knowledge and encouraging sunscreen use than written materials.More effective patient educational methods to encourage sun protection activities, such as regular sunscreen use, have the potential to increase awareness and foster positive, preventative health behaviors against skin cancers."
1421,21112424,To investigate the differences between the effects of complex decongestive physiotherapy with and without active resistive exercise for the treatment of patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).,"Randomized control-group study.An outpatient rehabilitation clinic.Patients (N=40) with diagnosed BCRL.Patients were randomly assigned to either the active resistive exercise group or the nonactive resistive exercise group. In the active resistive exercise group, after complex decongestive physiotherapy, active resistive exercise was performed for 15min/d, 5 days a week for 8 weeks. The nonactive resistive exercise group performed only complex decongestive physiotherapy.The circumferences of the upper limbs (proximal, distal, and total) for the volume changes, and the Short Form-36 version 2 questionnaire for the quality of life (QOL) at pretreatment and 8 weeks posttreatment for each patient.","The volume of the proximal part of the arm was significantly more reduced in the active resistive exercise group than that of the nonactive resistive exercise group (P&lt;.05). In the active resistive exercise group, there was significantly more improvement in physical health and general health, as compared with that of the nonactive resistive exercise group (P&lt;.05).","For the treatment of patients with BCRL, active resistive exercise with complex decongestive physiotherapy did not cause additional swelling, and it significantly reduced proximal arm volume and helped improve QOL."
1422,7473835,"Epidemiologic studies have shown that consuming foods containing beta-carotene is associated with a decreased incidence of colon cancer. The validity of this association has recently been questioned. It is not known if the rate of colonic cell proliferation differs among individuals with or without a history of colonic polyps or cancer and if proliferation changes in response to beta-carotene.This study was intended to (a) determine whether differences exist in colonic cell proliferation in individuals with and without prior colonic polyps or tumors, (b) demonstrate that beta-carotene accumulates in colonic mucosa following dietary supplementation, and (c) determine whether mucosal beta-carotene accumulation influences colonic cell proliferation.","Subjects were enrolled in the phase I study from June 1991 until February 1994. The participants included 20 individuals (11 males and nine females, aged 62.3 +/- 8.9 years [means +/- SD]) with normal colons (as judged by recent colonoscopy), 40 (24 males and 16 females, aged 59.6 +/- 10.1 years) with a history of colonic polyp(s), and 41 (30 males and 11 females, aged 67.2 +/- 9.7 years) with prior colon cancer. The subjects in the last two groups consumed either 30 mg of beta-carotene or placebo each morning for 3 months. This dose of beta-carotene has no known toxic effects, but it can increase the serum level by approximately 10-fold. beta-carotene concentration in serum and colonic tissue was quantitated by high-pressure liquid chromatography in samples collected before and after supplementation with beta-carotene or placebo. Cellular proliferation was assessed on the basis of tissue ornithine decarboxylase activity, urinary polyamine excretion, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression. The differences in colonic cell proliferation parameters due to beta-carotene supplementation, within and among different groups, were evaluated by the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranked test and the Mann-Whitney test, respectively. All statistical tests were two-sided.","Colonic cell proliferation did not differ in samples obtained from individuals with and without prior colonic polyp(s) or cancer. beta-carotene concentrations in serum and colonic tissue were significantly increased in groups receiving beta-carotene (P &lt; .001). However, cell proliferation did not differ, as judged by any of the three measures, among samples from all experimental groups collected before and after supplementation with beta-carotene.",Dietary supplementation with beta-carotene for a period of 3 months does not alter colonic cell proliferation in individuals with a history of colonic polyps or cancer.The mechanism by which beta-carotene might reduce colon cancer incidence does not appear to involve or result in a change in cell proliferation in the normal colonic mucosa as studied in individuals with a history of colonic polyps or cancer.
1423,26101306,We tested the efficacy of a remote tailored intervention Tele-Cancer Risk Assessment and Evaluation (TeleCARE) compared with a mailed educational brochure for improving colonoscopy uptake among at-risk relatives of colorectal cancer patients and examined subgroup differences based on participant reported cost barriers.,"Family members of colorectal cancer patients who were not up-to-date with colonoscopy were randomly assigned as family units to TeleCARE (N = 232) or an educational brochure (N = 249). At the 9-month follow-up, a cost resource letter listing resources for free or reduced-cost colonoscopy was mailed to participants who had reported cost barriers and remained nonadherent. Rates of medically verified colonoscopy at the 15-month follow-up were compared on the basis of group assignment and within group stratification by cost barriers.","In intent-to-treat analysis, 42.7% of participants in TeleCARE and 24.1% of participants in the educational brochure group had a medically verified colonoscopy [OR, 2.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-3.52]. Cost was identified as a barrier in both groups (TeleCARE = 62.5%; educational brochure = 57.0%). When cost was not a barrier, the TeleCARE group was almost four times as likely as the comparison to have a colonoscopy (OR, 3.66; 95% CI, 1.85-7.24). The intervention was efficacious among those who reported cost barriers; the TeleCARE group was nearly twice as likely to have a colonoscopy (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12-3.52).",TeleCARE increased colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers.Remote interventions may bolster screening colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers and be more efficacious when cost barriers are absent.
1424,15883439,"Low intake of dietary fat and high intake of soy foods have been suggested to partly explain the lower breast cancer rates in Asia, perhaps because of lower endogenous estrogens.The objective was to assess the hormonal and nonhormonal effects of diets resembling an Asian diet in terms of total fat and soy food contents.","Fifty-seven postmenopausal women participated in a randomized, controlled, dietary intervention study. The subjects consumed a very-low-fat diet (VLFD; 11% of energy as fat), a Step I diet (25% of energy as fat) supplemented with soy food (SFD; 50 mg isoflavones/d), or a control Step I diet (CD; 27% of energy as fat) with no soy food. All diets were prepared at the General Clinical Research Center of the University of Southern California. Serum hormones and other markers were measured at baseline and every 2 wk during the 8 wk of intervention.","There were no significant differences in total estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin at the completion of the intervention between women in the SFD and VLFD groups and those in the CD group. Serum insulin decreased significantly in the SFD group, and leptin decreased significantly in the SFD and VLFD groups; however, these changes did not differ significantly from the changes in the CD group.","This study does not provide evidence that ingestion of soy food or a VLFD significantly reduces estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women. However, short-term changes in diet may have significant and beneficial effects on blood insulin and leptin concentrations."
1425,24599578,"Exercise may improve psychosocial distress in patients with cancer; however, few studies have examined the effects of different types or doses of exercise, or whether exercise effects are related to baseline depression levels.","In a multicenter trial in Canada, we randomized 301 patients with breast cancer initiating chemotherapy to thrice weekly, supervised exercise consisting of either a standard dose of 25 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (STAN; n = 96), a higher dose of 50 to 60 minutes of aerobic exercise (HIGH; n = 101), or a combined dose of 50 to 60 minutes of aerobic and resistance exercise (COMB; n = 104). The primary endpoint was depression assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale at baseline, twice during chemotherapy, and postchemotherapy. Secondary endpoints were anxiety, perceived stress, and self-esteem.","Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that neither HIGH [mean difference = -0.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), +0.0 to -1.8; P = 0.061] nor COMB (mean difference = -0.4; 95% CI, +0.5 to -1.3; P = 0.36) was superior to STAN for managing depressive symptoms. In a planned subgroup analysis, there was a significant interaction with baseline depression levels (P interaction = 0.027) indicating that COMB and HIGH were effective for managing depressive symptoms in patients with clinical levels of depressive symptoms at baseline.","Compared with a standard volume of aerobic exercise, higher volumes of exercise did not help manage depressive symptoms in unselected patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy, but they were effective in patients with clinical levels of depressive symptoms at baseline.A phase III exercise trial targeting depressed patients with breast cancer is warranted."

This 24% reduction is equivalent to the prevention of an average of 1 additional SK per person over that time. A reduction in the rate of change of SK prevalence was also seen in the sunscreen intervention group relative to the discretionary sunscreen group between 1994 and 1996, but it was not significant. No effect on the rate of change of prevalent SK counts was seen among those taking beta carotene supplements relative to those taking placebo tablets.","Daily application of sunscreen retarded the rate of SK acquisition among adults in a subtropical environment, while a beta carotene supplementation of 30 mg/d had no influence on the occurrence of SKs."
1429,27809814,The aim was to develop and evaluate a training program for physicians for communicating with breast cancer patients about complementary medicine (CM).,"In a cluster-randomized pilot trial eight breast cancer centers (two physicians per center) were randomized to either a complementary communication training program (9\u00a0h e-learning\u2009+\u200920\u00a0h on-site skills training) or to a control group without training. Each physician was asked to consult ten patients for whom he or she is not the physician in charge. We used mixed methods: Quantitative outcomes included physicians' assessments (empathy, complexity of consultation, knowledge transfer) and patients' assessments (satisfaction, empathy, knowledge transfer). For qualitative analyses, 15 (eight in the training and seven in the control group) videotaped consultations were analyzed based on grounded theory, and separate focus groups with the physicians of both groups were conducted.","A total of 137 patients were included. Although cluster-randomized, physicians in the two groups differed. Those in the training group were younger (33.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9 vs. 40.0\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5\u00a0years) and had less work experience (5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9 vs. 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4\u00a0years). Patient satisfaction with the CM consultation was relatively high on a scale from 0 to 24 and was comparable in the two groups (training group: 19.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.6; control group 20.5\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1). The qualitative findings showed that physicians structured majority of consultations as taught during the training. Comparing only the younger and less CM experienced physicians, those trained in CM communication felt more confident discussing CM-related topics than those without training.",A CM communication-training program might be especially beneficial for physicians with less consulting experience when communicating about CM-related issues. A larger trial using more suitable quantitative outcomes needs to confirm this.

Patients were treated for a mean (SD) of 4.5 (2.8) years and had a total follow-up of 6.4 (2.0) years.Oral administration of 200 microg of selenium per day or placebo.The primary end points for the trial were the incidences of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. The secondary end points, established in 1990, were all-cause mortality and total cancer mortality, total cancer incidence, and the incidences of lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers.","After a total follow-up of 8271 person-years, selenium treatment did not significantly affect the incidence of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer. There were 377 new cases of basal cell skin cancer among patients in the selenium group and 350 cases among the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-1.28), and 218 new squamous cell skin cancers in the selenium group and 190 cases among the controls (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93-1.39). Analysis of secondary end points revealed that, compared with controls, patients treated with selenium had a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality (108 deaths in the selenium group and 129 deaths in the control group [RR; 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63-1.08]) and significant reductions in total cancer mortality (29 deaths in the selenium treatment group and 57 deaths in controls [RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.80]), total cancer incidence (77 cancers in the selenium group and 119 in controls [RR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.85]), and incidences of lung, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Primarily because of the apparent reductions in total cancer mortality and total cancer incidence in the selenium group, the blinded phase of the trial was stopped early. No cases of selenium toxicity occurred.","Selenium treatment did not protect against development of basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. However, results from secondary end-point analyses support the hypothesis that supplemental selenium may reduce the incidence of, and mortality from, carcinomas of several sites. These effects of selenium require confirmation in an independent trial of appropriate design before new public health recommendations regarding selenium supplementation can be made"

Increased physical activity was associated with favorable changes in IL-6 for participants in the intervention group (R(2)\u2009=0.18; P&lt;0.03).",Favorable changes in cytokine levels were observed in association with weight loss in this exploratory study with overweight breast cancer survivors.
1440,16097900,"Previously, we have linked theoretically based cognitive and emotional variables to the ability of cancer patients to quit smoking.In this study, we evaluated the impact of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which addressed these theoretically derived cognitive and emotional variables linked to tobacco use in this population, for promoting smoking cessation in a sample of cancer patients and assessed longitudinal predictors of smoking cessation.","Cancer patients (N=109) were randomized to either the theoretically based CBT intervention or to a general health education (GHE) condition, and all patients received nicotine replacement therapy.","Contrary to our expectation, no significant difference in 30-day point-prevalence abstinence between the CBT and GHE conditions was detected at either a 1-month (44.9 vs. 47.3%, respectively) or 3-month (43.2% vs. 39.2%, respectively) follow-up evaluation. Higher quit motivation and lower cons of quitting were related to smoking cessation.","Implications for the implementation of smoking cessation behavioral treatments in the oncologic context are discussed, as are directions for future research in this area."
1441,7658482,"Data from studies using rodents suggest that dietary calcium inhibits bile acid-induced mucosal damage and experimental carcinogenesis in the large bowel. However, in humans, the effect of dietary calcium and calcium supplementation on proliferation and carcinogenesis in the large bowel has been unclear.To assess the effect of calcium supplementation on rectal mucosal proliferation in humans, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial.","Participants were part of a larger multicenter chemoprevention trial; all were at high risk for large-bowel neoplasia, with at least one large-bowel adenoma removed endoscopically within the 3 months before study entry but with no known polyps remaining. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily either 3000 mg of calcium carbonate (providing 1200 mg elemental calcium) or an identical-appearing placebo tablet. During a scheduled endoscopy 6-9 months after random assignment (approximately 1 year after the qualifying endoscopy), rectal mucosal samples were obtained from 333 patients (173 assigned to calcium and 160 assigned to placebo). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling indices (LIs) were computed as the measure of proliferation in specimens from 146 patients receiving calcium and 129 patients receiving placebo. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling was used to measure proliferation in a smaller number of specimens (27 calcium-receiving and 31 placebo-receiving participants). For each scorable crypt having at least one labeled cell (or surrounded by crypts with at least one labeled cell), a crypt LI was calculated as the number of labeled cells divided by the total number of crypt cells. Crypt LIs were averaged to produce a participant's average LI.","The overall unadjusted mean PCNA LIs (+/- SE) were similar in the calcium and placebo groups (3.85% +/- 0.08% versus 3.92% +/- 0.08%, respectively, P = .30). The overall unadjusted mean BrdU LIs (+/- SE) were 3.88% +/- 0.30% in the calcium group and 3.54% +/- 0.21% in the placebo group (P = .54). PCNA labeling indices in the most luminal 40% of the crypt were small but, if anything, were higher in the calcium group. There was no patient subgroup within which calcium had an antiproliferative effect; the overall findings persisted among patients with high and low calcium intake, high and low fat intake, and high and low fiber intake.","Calcium supplementation does not decrease rectal mucosal proliferation, as measured by PCNA (and BrdU) immunohistochemistry, in patients with previous large-bowel adenomas. This study, therefore, does not provide evidence for an anticarcinogenic effect of calcium."
1442,14965157,"To present an adverse effect monitoring tool with theoretical, practical, and data-supported explanation and justification for use in pharmacy practice for the purpose of building patient-pharmacist partnerships and improving medication-management outcomes.","Randomized pretest-posttest experimental design.Ambulatory patients in three multidisciplinary cancer clinics.74 patients who were beginning chemotherapy.A calendar for daily adverse drug event tracking by ambulatory patients was adapted from The WriteTrack: Personal Health Tracker and provided to those assigned to the intervention group, who were asked to record symptoms and possible adverse drug events during their first two chemotherapy cycles. Patient reports of self-monitoring activities were gathered through posttests (n = 74) and semistructured interviews (n = 7).Self-reported use and perceived usefulness of the tool.","A total of 88.4% of the experimental group (38 of 43 individuals) reported using the monitoring tool to keep written track of adverse effects, while 38.7% of the control group (12 of 31 individuals) reported keeping some form of written record of their experiences. A total of 65.8% of those in the intervention group found patterns in their adverse effects, 47.4% indicated they took the calendar to the clinic to help them recall events, and 26.3% reported using the calendar at the clinic to show their health care team what was happening. Experimental group subjects most often shared the adverse effect monitoring information with nurses alone (23.7%). Patients using the diary indicated that it had a high degree of utility and value and that they would use it again and recommend it to other patients with cancer.","A system for adverse effect monitoring by patients in the context of cancer drug management was acceptable and useful, and pharmacists could incorporate this tool into their daily practice with minimal effort, time, and expense. Patients' self-documented symptoms and adverse effects can be valuable data when used to help tailor medication regimens to improve clinical status while satisfying patients' personal priorities."
1443,17991659,"Higher circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations have been related to a greater risk of cancer. Lycopene intake is inversely associated with cancer risk, and experimental studies have shown that it may affect the IGF system, possibly through an effect on IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs).The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of an 8-wk supplementation with tomato-derived lycopene (30 mg/d) on serum concentrations of total IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3.","We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover study in 40 men and 31 postmenopausal women with a family history of colorectal cancer, a personal history of colorectal adenoma, or both.","Lycopene supplementation significantly (P = 0.01) increased serum IGFBP-1 concentrations in women (median relative difference between serum IGFBP-1 concentrations after lycopene supplementation and after placebo, 21.7%).

Total IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 concentrations were not significantly altered by lycopene supplementation.","This is the first study known to show that lycopene supplementation may increase circulating IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 concentrations. Because of high interindividual variations in IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 effects, these results should be confirmed in larger randomized intervention studies."
1444,11129765,"Changes in the healthcare system have resulted in shortened hospital stays, moving the focus of care from the hospital to the home. Patients are discharged post-operatively with ongoing needs, and whether they receive nursing care post-hospitalization can influence their recovery and survival. Little information is available about the factors that influence outcomes, including the survival of older cancer patients after cancer surgery.To compare the length of survival of older post-surgical cancer patients who received a specialized home care intervention provided by advanced practice nurses (APNs) with that of patients who received usual follow-up care in an ambulatory setting. We also assessed potential predictors of survival in terms of depressive symptoms, symptom distress, functional status, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, age of patient, and stage of disease.","A randomized controlled intervention study.Discharged older cancer patients after surgery at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in southeastern Pennsylvania.Three hundred seventy-five patients aged 60 to 92, newly diagnosed with solid cancers, were treated surgically between February 1993 and December 1995. One hundred ninety patients were randomized to the intervention groups and 185 to the usual care group.The intervention was a standardized protocol that consisted of standard assessment and management post-surgical guidelines, doses of instructional content, and schedules of contacts. The intervention lasted 4 weeks and consisted of three home visits and five telephone contacts provided by APNs. Both the patients and their family caregivers received comprehensive clinical assessments, monitoring, and teaching, including skills training.Time from enrollment of patients into the study until death or last date known alive at the end of November 1996.","During the 44-month follow-up period, 93 (24.8%) of 375 patients died. Forty-one (22%) of those who died were patients in the specialized home care intervention group, compared with 52 (28%) in the usual care group. Stage of disease at diagnosis differed between the two groups at baseline (38% late stage patients in the intervention group compared with 26% in the control group, P = .01), so stratified analysis was performed. Overall, the specialized home care intervention group was found to have increased survival (P = .002 using stratified log-rank test). Among early stage patients only, there was no difference in survival between the intervention and control groups. Among late stage patients, there was improved survival in the intervention group. For example, 2-year survival among late stage intervention group cases was 67% compared with 40% among control cases. When Cox's proportional hazard model was used to adjust for significant baseline covariates, the relative hazard of death in the usual care group was 2.04 (CI: 1.33 to 3.12; P = .001) after adjusting for stage of disease and surgical hospitalization length of stay.",This is the first empirical study of post-surgical cancer patients to link a specialized home care intervention by advanced practice nurses with improved survival. Additional research is needed to test home care interventions aimed at maintaining quality of life outcomes and their effects on survival of post-surgical cancer patients.
1445,18980921,To investigate the effects of supervised exercise training on cardiopulmonary function and fatigue in cancer survivors undergoing various clinical treatments.,"Pretest and post-test quasiexperimental.Outpatient oncology rehabilitation center.96 breast cancer survivors undergoing various clinical treatments.Subjects were divided into four groups based on the specific type of clinical treatment: surgery alone (n = 22); surgery and chemotherapy (n = 30); surgery and radiation (n = 17); and surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation (n = 27). Following a comprehensive screening and medical examination, cardiovascular endurance, pulmonary function, and fatigue were assessed, leading to the development of an individualized exercise prescription and a six-month exercise intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and covariance were used to compare the effectiveness of the intervention and differences among treatment groups.Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, predicted oxygen consumption, time on treadmill, and fatigue.","Cardiopulmonary function (predicted maximal oxygen consumption and time on treadmill) significantly increased in all groups after exercise training. In addition, resting heart rate and forced vital capacity significantly improved in those receiving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Psychologically, the exercise intervention resulted in significant reductions in behavioral, affective, sensory, cognitive and mood, and total fatigue scale scores in all three groups who received treatment with surgery. The breast cancer survivors in the surgery-alone group showed significant reductions in behavioral, affective, and total fatigue scale scores but not in sensory and cognitive and mood fatigue scale scores.","The results suggest that moderate intensity, individualized, prescriptive exercise maintains or improves cardiopulmonary function with concomitant reductions in fatigue regardless of treatment type. Moreover, cancer survivors receiving combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy following surgery appear to benefit to a greater extent as a result of an individualized exercise intervention.Clinicians need to be aware of adjuvant therapies such as moderate exercise that attenuate negative side effects of cancer treatments. Symptom management recommendations should be given to cancer survivors concerning the effectiveness of exercise throughout the cancer continuum and the importance of participating in a cancer rehabilitation exercise program."

1447,18537470,"Nausea that develops during the period that begins 24 hours after the administration of chemotherapy is called delayed nausea, and occurs in many patients with cancer. Meals high in protein decrease the nausea of motion sickness and pregnancy, possibly by reducing gastric dysrhythmias. Ginger also has antinausea properties.To explore the use of protein meals with ginger for the treatment of the delayed nausea of chemotherapy.","Twenty-eight (28) patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy for the first time were assigned to 1 of 3 groups. For 3 days beginning the day after their chemotherapy, Control Group patients continued with their normal diet, Protein Group patients consumed a protein drink and ginger twice daily, and High Protein Group patients consumed a protein drink with additional protein and ginger twice daily.Patients recorded in a diary each day whether they had experienced nausea, whether their nausea had been frequent, whether their nausea had been bothersome, and whether they had needed any antiemetic medication. Gastric myoelectrical activity was assessed in 5 patients before and after ingestion of a high protein meal and ginger.","Reports of nausea, frequent nausea, and bothersome nausea were significantly less common among High Protein Group patients than among Control and Protein Group patients. Furthermore, significantly fewer patients in the High Protein Group used antiemetic medication. Differences between the Protein and Control groups were not statistically significant. In the 5 patients who had tests of gastric myoelectrical activity performed, a significant decrease in gastric dysrhythmia occurred after ingestion of the protein and ginger.","High protein meals with ginger reduced the delayed nausea of chemotherapy and reduced use of antiemetic medications. Protein with ginger holds the potential of representing a novel, nutritionally based treatment for the delayed nausea of chemotherapy."

1459,18062059,The efficacy of a group-based psychosocial intervention with ethnic minority health populations may depend on consideration for cultural factors that can interact with group processes.The current study explored the efficacy of a 10-week group-based cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention that was linguistically and culturally adapted for use with Hispanic monolingual men recently treated for localized prostate carcinoma (PC).,71 Hispanic mono-lingual Spanish speakers were randomly assigned to a 10-week CBSM intervention or a half-day stress management seminar (control condition). Hierarchical regression was used to predict post-intervention QoL.,"After controlling for relevant covariates, assignment to the CBSM condition significantly predicted greater physical well-being, emotional well-being, sexual functioning, and total well-being after the 10-week intervention period.",Results suggest that participation in a culturally and linguistically adapted CBSM group intervention improved QoL in Hispanic monolingual men treated for localized PC.
1460,15882248,"H. pylori is the major cause of chronic gastritis, and a risk factor for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.To investigate the effect of probiotic supplementation on the tolerance and efficacy of H. pylori eradication treatment in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","A total of 338 volunteers were screened for H. pylori infection. The eligibility criteria were met by 47 subjects whose H. pylori infection was verified at the outset and re-evaluated after the treatment by the 13C-urea breath test and by enzyme immunoassay serology. The subjects were randomized to receive probiotic therapy (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. rhamnosusLC705, Bifidobacterium breve Bb99 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS) or a placebo during H. pylori eradication and for 3 weeks following the treatment, and recorded their daily symptoms in a standardized diary.","When the frequencies of new or aggravated symptoms were evaluated, no significant differences were found between the two groups for individual symptoms. However, the probiotic group showed less treatment-related symptoms as measured by the total symptom score change (P = 0.038) throughout the H. pylori eradication therapy in contrast to the placebo group. The H. pylori eradication rate was non-significantly higher in the group receiving probiotic therapy (91% vs. 79%, P = 0.42). In this group the recovery of probiotic bacteria in the faeces increased significantly (P &lt; 0.001).","In this pilot study, probiotic supplementation did not diminish significantly the frequency of new or aggravated symptoms during H. pylori eradication. However, our data suggest an improved tolerance to the eradication treatment when total symptom severity was taken into account. Furthermore, the results show that probiotic bacteria are able to survive in the gastrointestinal tract despite the intensive antimicrobial therapy."
1461,22540970,"The objective of this study was to determine the effects of physical therapy, including massage and exercise, on pain and mood in patients with advanced terminal cancer.","The design was a randomized controlled pilot study.Twenty-four (24) patients with terminal cancer were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.Group A received a physiotherapy intervention consisting of several massage techniques, mobilizations, and local and global exercises. Group B received a simple hand contact/touch to areas of pain (cervical area, shoulder, interscapular area, heels, and gastrocnemius), which was maintained for the same period of time as the intervention group. All patients received six sessions of 30-35 minutes in duration over a 2-week period.","Outcomes were collected at baseline, at 1 week, and at a 2-week follow-up (after treatment completion) by an assessor blinded to the treatment allocation of the participants.

The intervention consisted of a relaxation and counselling session performed by a senior doctor. Follow up questionnaires were completed at six weeks. Demographic and tumour data were collated independently.,"Complete data were available on 50 patients. There were no significant differences in demographic, social support or tumour characteristics between the two groups. Multivariate analysis determined that only the intervention and baseline score were significant predictors of outcome. The intervention was associated with a significant reduction in total HADS score (P = 0.002). The reduction was seen in both anxiety and moderate depression subscales (P = 0.001 and P = 0.02). The intervention was also associated with a significant reduction in total GHQ-28 score and in three of the four subscale scores (somatisation, anxiety and personality development; all P &lt; 0.02). However, no significant difference was found in the fourth subscale of major depression.",A relaxation and counselling intervention performed by a treating doctor reduces psychological symptoms in women with a new diagnosis of gynaecological cancer.
1464,28623628,"Shared decision making (SDM) has been advocated as an approach to medical decision making that can improve decisional quality. Decision aids are tools that facilitate SDM in the context of limited physician time; however, many decision aids do not incorporate preference measurement.We aim to understand whether adding preference measurement to a standard patient educational intervention improves decisional quality and is feasible in a busy clinical setting.","Men with incident localized prostate cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0122) were recruited from the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center urology clinic, Olive View UCLA Medical Center, and Harbor UCLA Medical Center from January 2011 to May 2015 and randomized to education with a brochure about prostate cancer treatment or software-based preference assessment in addition to the brochure. Men undergoing preference assessment received a report detailing the relative strength of their preferences for treatment outcomes used in review with their doctor. Participants completed instruments measuring decisional conflict, knowledge, SDM, and patient satisfaction with care before and/or after their cancer consultation.","Baseline knowledge scores were low (mean 62%). The baseline mean total score on the Decisional Conflict Scale was 2.3 (\u00b10.9), signifying moderate decisional conflict. Men undergoing preference assessment had a significantly larger decrease in decisional conflict total score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) and the Perceived Effective Decision Making subscale (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) post consult compared with those receiving education only. Improvements in satisfaction with care, SDM, and knowledge were similar between groups.",Individual-level preference assessment is feasible in the clinic setting. Patients with prostate cancer who undergo preference assessment are more certain about their treatment decisions and report decreased levels of decisional conflict when making these decisions.
1465,21613554,"Low concentrations of circulating vitamin D are common with obesity and may represent a potential mechanism explaining the elevated risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular outcomes observed in individuals who are overweight or obese.The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of 12 mo of weight loss through caloric restriction, exercise intervention, or both on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations.","Overweight and obese postmenopausal women (n = 439) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: 1) diet modification (n = 118), 2) exercise (n = 117), 3) diet + exercise (n = 117), or 4) control (n = 87). The diet intervention was a group-based reduced-calorie program with a 10% weight-loss goal. The exercise intervention consisted of 45 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic activity daily for 5 d/wk. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by using a competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay at baseline and 12 mo.","No significant change in serum 25(OH)D was found between the intervention and control groups.

1466,26423617,"Following treatment, haematological cancer (HEM) patients exhibit significant physical deconditioning and psychological distress. Exercise has been shown as a clinically effective and safe intervention for cancer patients, with the potential to reverse the deleterious effects following treatment. Our aim was to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week exercise rehabilitation on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and associated outcomes in HEM patients post-treatment.","Patients with a HEM were recruited to participate in a 12-week exercise rehabilitation intervention post-treatment. Pre-, post- and follow-up assessments were conducted on outcome measures including CRF, quality of life (QoL), psychological distress, cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength (MS) and body composition. Patients were given tailored exercise programmes comprising aerobic and resistance exercises, carried out three times per week for 12 weeks in local gyms and clinics. Usual-care participants were offered a delayed, tailored 12-week exercise intervention after the initial study period.","Thirty-seven patients (49 % recruitment rate) were randomly assigned to the 12-week exercise rehabilitation (n\u2009=\u200918) or usual care (n\u2009=\u200919) with a 91 % adherence to the exercise intervention.

1467,20651011,"Research suggests that cancer rehabilitation reduces fatigue in survivors of cancer. To date, it is unclear what type of rehabilitation is most beneficial.This randomized controlled trial compared the effect on cancer-related fatigue of physical training combined with cognitive behavioral therapy with physical training alone and with no intervention.","In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, 147 survivors of cancer were randomly assigned to a group that received physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy (PT+CBT group, n=76) or to a group that received physical training alone (PT group, n=71). In addition, a nonintervention control group (WLC group) consisting of 62 survivors of cancer who were on the waiting lists of rehabilitation centers elsewhere was included.The study was conducted at 4 rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands.All patients were survivors of cancer.Physical training consisting of 2 hours of individual training and group sports took place twice weekly, and cognitive-behavioral therapy took place once weekly for 2 hours.Fatigue was assessed with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory before and immediately after intervention (12 weeks after enrollment). The WLC group completed questionnaires at the same time points.","Baseline fatigue did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. Over time, levels of fatigue significantly decreased in all domains in all groups, except in mental fatigue in the WLC group. Analyses of variance of postintervention fatigue showed statistically significant group effects on general fatigue, on physical and mental fatigue, and on reduced activation but not on reduced motivation. Compared with the WLC group, the PT group reported significantly greater decline in 4 domains of fatigue, whereas the PT+CBT group reported significantly greater decline in physical fatigue only. No significant differences in decline in fatigue were found between the PT+CBT and PT groups.","Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training."
1468,18370886,"Patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative care often experience severe physical and psychosocial symptoms. However, there are limited resources for psychological and emotional support. Expressive writing has shown decreased anxiety level in young and healthy people suffering from a number of stressors.The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of expressive writing in patients receiving palliative care and the most suitable outcomes of expressive writing in this patient population.","In this pilot study, patients were randomly assigned to either the expressive writing group (EW) or the neutral writing group (NW). Anxiety level before and after the writing session was compared between the two groups. Writing materials were content analyzed using standard qualitative research methods.","A total of 24 patients (12 in EW and 12 in NW) were enrolled in the study between October 2006 and January 2007. Although the majority of patients (83%-100%) were able to complete all baseline assessments, poor adherence was observed during the follow-ups. Only 8% of patients completed the 2-week study. There was no significant difference in the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) State-Anxiety scores at baseline, before and after each writing session between the EW and NW groups.","Our rapid accrual suggests that palliative care patients are interested in participating in studies such as expressive writing. The high level of adherence to the baseline assessments indicates that these assessments were not particularly difficult for our patients to complete. Future studies may need to include patients with better performance status, better patient education, means of emotional expression (i.e., audio recording, telephone interview) and improved adherence.We conclude that clinical trials of expressive writing in the palliative care setting are not feasible unless they undergo major modification in methods compared to those previous reported in other patient population. Our findings will hopefully assist researchers considering similar studies."

Calcium administration has ameliorated the proliferative changes in rodents, and findings in small, uncontrolled clinical trials have suggested similar effects in humans.This preliminary, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was designed 1) to investigate whether supplemental calcium will reduce colonic epithelial cell proliferation in patients with sporadic adenomas who consume a high-fat, Western-style diet; 2) to determine the sample size (number of scorable crypts per person) needed to achieve adequate statistical power; and 3) to evaluate the feasibility of full-scale clinical trials.","Twenty-one sporadic adenoma patients were treated daily with placebo or 1200 mg of supplemental calcium. To determine colonic epithelial cell proliferation, we used tritiated thymidine labeling of colon crypt epithelial cells in rectal biopsy specimens and calculated the percentage of labeled cells (labeling index [LI]). Two pathology technician &quot;readers&quot; independently scored each specimen, and inter-reader reliability was determined. Subjects remained on their usual diet during the study, and intake of calories, calcium, total fat, and vitamin D did not differ substantially among them. We calculated curves for statistical power to determine the number of scorable crypts needed per person for detection of a statistically significant difference (P &lt; .05) of 1.0% in mean LI.","The pooled baseline LI was 4.7%. In the calcium-treated group, the LI increased 0.6% (proportional increase, 12.8%); in the placebo-treated group, it decreased 0.5% (proportional decrease, 10.6%). The difference between change in the mean LI from baseline to 8 weeks' follow-up in the placebo group versus the calcium group was not statistically significant. The intraclass correlation coefficient for inter-reader reliability for the baseline LI was .66. Analyses indicated scoring eight crypts sufficient for estimates of the LI adequate for between-group comparisons, a level achieved in 81% of biopsy specimens.","Calcium carbonate supplements delivering 1200 mg elemental calcium daily may not decrease colonic epithelial cell proliferation over an 8-week period in sporadic adenoma patients. In future trials measuring the LI, consideration should be given to ensuring adequate numbers of scorable crypts and to the impact of inadequate biopsy procedures, labeling failure, reader reliability, and participant withdrawal. Our findings support the feasibility of a full-scale clinical trial to further study the relationships among dietary calcium, colonic epithelial cell proliferation, and colorectal cancer."
1478,24096465,"The majority of women with breast cancer experience treatment-related fatigue. Fatigue makes patients more inclined to terminate their treatment, which influences patient prognosis and survivorship.This study explores the effects of a walking program on fatigue and exercise capacity in women who have undergone breast cancer surgery.","This was a randomized control trial study with measures taken 3 times over 5 weeks. Sixty-six women with breast cancer were recruited from a medical center in central Taiwan. The intervention was a moderate-intensity, home-based walking program. The Functional Assessment for Chronic Illness Treatment-Fatigue and distance walked in a 6-minute period, respectively, were used to score the main outcome measures of fatigue and exercise capacity.","For those who accepted chemotherapy, fatigue was significantly higher during chemotherapy than after surgery. Although participants in the walking program achieved gradually reduced fatigue and increased exercise capacity, there was no significant difference in fatigue and exercise capacity between the exercise and control groups at any of the three measured times.",Nurse collaboration with healthcare providers to promote exercise in the breast cancer population may not only improve the health of post-surgery breast cancer women but also enhance the independent functioning of nurses and advance the nursing profession.
1479,17309378,"The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of massage on nausea, anxiety, and depression in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy.","This work was a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.This study was conducted in an oncology clinic, in a hospital in southwestern Sweden.Thirty-nine (39) women (mean age = 51.8) with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy were enrolled.The patients were randomly assigned to a massage therapy group (20 minutes of massage on five occasions) or a control group (five 20-minute visits).All patients recorded nausea and anxiety on the Visual Analogue Scale before and after each intervention. They also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.",Massage treatment significantly reduced nausea compared with control treatment (p = 0.025) when improvement was measured as a percentage of the five treatment periods. Differences in anxiety and depression between the two treatment regimes could not be statistically demonstrated.,This study complements previous studies on the effect of massage and supports the conclusion that massage reduces nausea in these patients.
1480,28920142,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is potentially curative for a number of hematologic malignancies, but is associated with high symptom burden. We conducted a randomized sham-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate efficacy and safety of acupuncture as an integrative treatment for managing common symptoms during HCT.","Adult patients with multiple myeloma undergoing high-dose melphalan followed by autologous HCT (AHCT) were randomized to receive either true or sham acupuncture once daily for 5\u00a0days starting the day after chemotherapy. Patients and clinical evaluators, but not acupuncturists, were blinded to group assignment. Symptom burden, the primary outcome was assessed with the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) at baseline, during transplantation, and at 15 and 30\u00a0days post transplantation.","Among 60 participants, true acupuncture produced nonsignificant reductions in overall MDASI core symptom scores and symptom interference scores during transplantation (P\u00a0=\u00a0.4 and .3, respectively), at 15\u00a0days (P\u00a0=\u00a0.10 and .3), and at 30\u00a0days posttransplantation (P\u00a0=\u00a0.2 and .4) relative to sham. However, true acupuncture was significantly more efficacious in reducing nausea, lack of appetite, and drowsiness at 15\u00a0days (P\u00a0=\u00a0.042, .025, and .010, respectively). Patients receiving sham acupuncture were more likely to increase pain medication use posttransplantation (odds ratio 5.31, P\u00a0=\u00a0.017).","Acupuncture was well tolerated with few attributable adverse events. True acupuncture may prevent escalation of symptoms including nausea, lack of appetite, and drowsiness experienced by patients undergoing AHCT, and reduce the use of pain medications. These findings need to be confirmed in a future definitive study."
1481,26148327,To examine differences in healthcare service utilization among patients with advanced cancer participating in a nurse-led psychoeducational intervention.,"Secondary analysis of trial data.Four Michigan cancer centers.484 patients with advanced cancer.Patients were randomized to three groups.Study arm (brief, extensive, or control), ED visitation (one or more times versus none), inpatient hospitalizations (one or more times versus none), and covariates.","No significant differences in ED visits or inpatient hospitalizations were observed among study arms. ED visits were more frequent for patients with lung or colorectal cancer, more comorbidities, and lower baseline QOL. Baseline QOL was associated with inpatient hospitalizations in the adjusted analysis.","The psychoeducational intervention, either in brief or extensive format, is unlikely to increase healthcare service utilization.Efficacious nurse-led psychoeducational interventions to improve QOL do not place undue burdens on the healthcare system and may improve care."
1482,29016548,"Few studies describing sun-protective behaviors, knowledge, and self-efficacy in African Americans exist. Although educational programs targeting Caucasians and Hispanics have been successful in increasing melanoma awareness and knowledge, no such investigation has been applied to African Americans.To evaluate the effectiveness of a brochure or video educational intervention on the sun-protective behaviors, knowledge, and self-efficacy regarding melanoma in African Americans.","A randomized controlled trial of a presurvey and postsurvey, in an academic outpatient dermatology clinic. Participants were self-identified African Americans, at least 18 years old, fluent, and literate in English. Patients randomized to the brochure-intervention group (n = 72) received a melanoma brochure from the National Cancer Institute. Patients randomized to the video-intervention group (n = 71) received the brochure and watched an online melanoma tutorial.","Sun-protective behaviors, knowledge, and self-efficacy regarding melanoma all improved equally from pre-to posteducation, in both the brochure- and video-intervention groups.",Melanoma educational interventions similar to those previously demonstrated to be successful in Caucasian and Hispanic populations are also effective among African Americans.
1483,20978060,To determine whether a decision aid designed for adults with low education and literacy can support informed choice and involvement in decisions about screening for bowel cancer.,"Randomised controlled trial.Areas in New South Wales, Australia identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged (low education attainment, high unemployment, and unskilled occupations).572 adults aged between 55 and 64 with low educational attainment, eligible for bowel cancer screening.Patient decision aid comprising a paper based interactive booklet (with and without a question prompt list) and a DVD, presenting quantitative risk information on the possible outcomes of screening using faecal occult blood testing compared with no testing. The control group received standard information developed for the Australian national bowel screening programme. All materials and a faecal occult blood test kit were posted directly to people's homes.Informed choice (adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening behaviour) and preferences for involvement in screening decisions.","Participants who received the decision aid showed higher levels of knowledge than the controls; the mean score (maximum score 12) for the decision aid group was 6.50 (95% confidence interval 6.15 to 6.84) and for the control group was 4.10 (3.85 to 4.36; P&lt;0.001). Attitudes towards screening were less positive in the decision aid group, with 51% of the participants expressing favourable attitudes compared with 65% of participants in the control group (14% difference, 95% confidence interval 5% to 23%; P=0.002). The participation rate for screening was reduced in the decision aid group: completion of faecal occult blood testing was 59% v 75% in the control group (16% difference, 8% to 24%; P=0.001). The decision aid increased the proportion of participants who made an informed choice, from 12% in the control group to 34% in the decision aid group (22% difference, 15% to 29%; P&lt;0.001). More participants in the decision aid group had no decisional conflict about the screening decision compared with the controls (51% v 38%; P=0.02). The groups did not differ for general anxiety or worry about bowel cancer.","Tailored decision support information can be effective in supporting informed choices and greater involvement in decisions about faecal occult blood testing among adults with low levels of education, without increasing anxiety or worry about developing bowel cancer. Using a decision aid to make an informed choice may, however, lead to lower uptake of screening.

1484,12081830,"Elevated iron stores, oxidative stress, and estrogen deficiency may place postmenopausal women at greater risk of heart disease and cancer than premenopausal women.The objective was to determine the effect of soy-protein isolate (SPI) intake and iron indexes on plasma total antioxidant status (TAS) in perimenopausal women after control for other contributing factors.","Perimenopausal women (n = 69) were randomly assigned (double blind) to treatment: isoflavone-rich SPI (SPI+; n = 24), isoflavone-poor SPI (SPI-; n = 24), or whey protein (control; n = 21). Each subject consumed 40 g soy or whey protein daily for 24 wk. Plasma TAS, serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin were measured at baseline, week 12, and week 24.","No significant time-by-treatment interactions on iron indexes or TAS were observed, whereas time had an effect on serum ferritin (P &lt; or = 0.0001) and hemoglobin (P = 0.004) but not on TAS. Multiple regression analysis showed that at week 12, 48% (P &lt; or = 0.0001) of the variability in TAS was accounted for by baseline TAS, alcohol intake, soy intake (soy compared with control; P = 0.016), plasma lipoprotein(a), and dietary iron. At week 24, 47% of the variability in TAS was accounted for by baseline TAS, serum ferritin, serum estrone, dietary zinc, and dietary meat, fish, and poultry.","SPI intake had no significant effect on iron status, but our results suggest that dietary soy protein and low iron stores may protect perimenopausal women from oxidative stress."
1485,27837524,Exercise generally improves quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial functioning in adult populations but few randomized trials have examined dose-response effects.The purpose of the present study was to report the QoL and psychosocial outcomes from the Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA).,"Healthy but inactive postmenopausal women at risk for breast cancer were randomized to a year-long aerobic exercise intervention consisting of either 150\u00a0min/week (moderate volume group, n\u00a0=\u00a0200) or 300\u00a0min/week (high volume group, n\u00a0=\u00a0200). QoL was assessed at baseline and 1\u00a0year using the short form-36 health survey. Sleep quality, depression, anxiety, stress, self-esteem, and happiness were also assessed. Participant preference for group assignment (i.e., exercise volume) was assessed at baseline and tested as a moderator.","There were no statistically significant dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on any QoL, sleep quality, or psychosocial outcome. Participant preference for group assignment did not moderate any QoL, sleep quality, or psychosocial responses. Marital status was a significant moderator (p for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and obesity showed a trend towards being a moderator (p for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.08) of the dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on global sleep quality such that unmarried and obese women improved sleep quality with the higher volume of aerobic exercise.","A higher volume of aerobic exercise, approximately double the minimum public health guideline, did not provide additional QoL or psychosocial benefits compared to the minimum public health guideline in inactive postmenopausal women, even for women who preferred the higher volume of exercise at baseline."
1486,9492666,To determine the efficacy of adjuvant psychological therapy in patients with testicular cancer and to compare the characteristics and psychosocial outcomes of men who agreed to participate with those who declined to participate in a randomised trial of psychological intervention.,"Newly diagnosed patients were asked to participate in a randomised trial of psychological support compared with standard medical care. Participants and non-participants completed self assessment questionnaires at baseline and at 2, 4 and 12 months.Testicular Tumour Unit of the Royal Marsden Hospital.73 of 184 (40%) eligible patients agreed to enter the randomised trial (participants) and 81 (44%) declined to participate but agreed to complete further assessments (non-participants). 30 patients wanted no further contact with the researchers.Hospital anxiety and depression scale, psychosocial adjustment to illness scale, Rotterdam symptom checklist, mental adjustment to cancer scale. Only scores on the hospital anxiety and depression scale are reported for evaluating treatment efficacy.",111 of 184 (60%) eligible men declined to participate in the trial. Patients with stage I disease were most likely to refuse to participate. A patient was less likely to participate if he had low volume disease and was receiving no further treatment. Likelihood of participation was associated with stage of disease and with type of primary treatment (P &lt; 0.001 for heterogeneity). Patients with early stage disease (P &lt; 0.001) and fewer physical symptoms (P &lt; 0.001) were less likely to participate. Psychosocial factors associated with participation included anxious preoccupation regarding disease (P = 0.01). There were no differences in outcome between participants and non-participants during follow up. Patients seemed to gain little benefit from adjuvant psychological therapy. At 2 months change from baseline favoured the treated group in the anxiety subscale (mean difference between groups -1.41 (95% confidence interval -2.86 to 0.03)). This was not sustained when adjusted for factors related to the disease. By 12 months change from baseline seemed to favour the control group (mean difference between groups 1.66 (-0.18 to 3.50)).,Patients with testicular cancer seem to have considerable coping abilities. Those who declined to participate in the trial differed from those who participated. Those who agreed to participate may comprise the clinical group who perceive a need for psychological support. No evidence was found to indicate a need for routinely offering adjuvant psychological therapy.
1487,30137481,The glycolytic nature of cancer cells presents a potential treatment target that may be addressed by a ketogenic diet (KD).We hypothesized that a KD would improve body composition and lower serum insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in women with ovarian or endometrial cancer.,"In this randomized controlled trial, women with ovarian or endometrial cancer [age: \u226519 y; body mass index (kg/m2): \u226518.5] were randomly assigned to a KD (70:25:5 energy from fat, protein, and carbohydrate) or the American Cancer Society diet (ACS; high-fiber, low-fat). Body composition (DXA) and fasting serum insulin, IGF-I, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate were obtained at baseline and at 12 wk; urinary ketones were also measured throughout the intervention. We assessed differences between the diets with ANCOVA and independent t tests. We used correlation analyses to estimate associations between changes in serum analytes and body composition.","After 12 wk, the KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted total (35.3 compared with 38.0 kg, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) and android (3.0 compared with 3.3 kg, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) fat mass. Percentage of change in visceral fat was greater in the KD group (compared with the ACS group; -21.2% compared with -4.6%, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05). Adjusted total lean mass did not differ between the groups. The KD (compared with ACS) group had lower adjusted fasting serum insulin (7.6 compared with 11.2 \u00b5U/mL, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01). There was a significant inverse association between the changes in serum \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and IGF-I concentrations (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.57; P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001).","In women with ovarian or endometrial cancer, a KD results in selective loss of fat mass and retention of lean mass. Visceral fat mass and fasting serum insulin also are reduced by the KD, perhaps owing to enhanced insulin sensitivity. Elevated serum \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate may reflect a metabolic environment inhospitable to cancer proliferation. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03171506."
1488,17034283,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent tumor in Hong Kong. The immune system of such patients could be adversely affected during the course of conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Yunzhi-Danshen capsules in NPC patients treated with radiotherapy.,"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 16-week study.The Prince of Wales Hospital, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.Twenty-seven (27) patients with histologically proven NPC, at least 18 years of age.Twenty-seven patients with histologically proven NPC were recruited to take Yunzhi (3.6 g daily) and Dangshem (1.4 g daily) in the form of 12 combination capsules (TCM group) or placebo (12 capsules) daily for 16 weeks, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to assess the percentages and absolute counts of human lymphocyte subsets in whole blood. Plasma concentration of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Ex vivo production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 in the whole blood assay culture supernatant was measured by ELISA.","The decreases in percentage and absolute count of T lymphocytes in the TCM group were less than those in the placebo group after they took the capsules for 16 weeks (both p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the decreases in absolute count of T suppressor cells plus cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and T helper cells in the TCM group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group after they took the capsules for 16 weeks (both p &lt; 0.05).",These results suggest that Yunzhi-Danshen can exert an immunomodulating effect in alleviating lymphopenia during radiotherapy in NPC patients.
1489,29137837,"To evaluate the effectiveness of a game-based learning (GBL) intervention, Tapamole, in improving recognition of the features of melanoma (MM) compared to a written education intervention.","Tapamole, an online education intervention, was developed using GBL. Participants were voluntarily recruited from the Dermatology waiting room and randomized to three groups: game, pamphlet, and no intervention. Participants completed a pre-intervention survey, post-intervention survey, and test on MM recognition. Clustered binary data equations were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for each group and GEE model with log link was used to compare measures between groups.",Sixty participants were recruited. The sensitivity for MM recognition in the game group was 100% compared to 95% for the pamphlet group. The specificity (40.8% vs 53.3%) and accuracy (60.6% vs 67.2%) of the game and pamphlet groups were similar. Participants in the game group reported higher enjoyment than those in the pamphlet group.,"GBL was as effective as the written intervention in identifying features of MM.With increasing use of the Internet for health information, it is critical to have effective online education interventions. GBL education tools are effective, enjoyable, and should be used to improve MM patient education."
1490,11468500,Test whether physicians' counseling patients for smoking cessation with an autonomy supportive rather than controlling style would increase patients' active involvement in the counseling session and increase maintained abstinence.,"Randomized trial of 27 community-based physicians using two interview styles, with observer ratings of patient active involvement and assessments of patient smoking status at 6 months, 12 months, and 30 months.Adult smokers: 336 recruited; 249 for final analyses.Physicians used an autonomy- supportive or controlling interpersonal style, randomly assigned within physician, to briefly counsel patients about smoking cessation, using the National Cancer Institute's 4-A's model.Patient active involvement was rated from audio tapes of the interviews. Continuous abstinence came from self-reports at 6 months, 12 months, and 30 months, CO validated at 6 months or 12 months and at 30 months.","Physician style did not have a significant direct effect on smoking cessation but did significantly increase patient active involvement in the interview. Active involvement, in turn, increased smoking cessation. Structural equation modeling confirmed a theoretical model in which the intervention positively predicted patient active involvement after controlling for patient reports of wanting to stop smoking, and active involvement significantly predicted continuous abstinence after controlling for previous quit attempts.","Although physicians' autonomy- supportive style while counseling smokers to quit did not have a direct effect on smoking cessation, it increased patients' active involvement in the counseling session which in turn increased continuous abstinence over 30 months. Further research should clarify the direct effects of physician interpersonal style on health outcomes."
1491,15585768,"Green and black tea polyphenols have been extensively studied as cancer chemopreventive agents. Many in vitro experiments have supported their strong antioxidant activity. Additional in vivo studies are needed to examine the pharmacokinetic relation of absorption and antioxidant activity of tea polyphenols administered in the form of green or black tea or tea extract supplements.The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic disposition of tea polyphenols and their effect on the antioxidant capacity in plasma 8 h after a bolus consumption of either green tea, black tea, or a green tea extract supplement.","Thirty healthy subjects were randomly assigned to 3 different sequences of green tea, black tea, or a green tea extract supplement in a 3 x 3 crossover design with a 1-wk washout period in between treatments.",Flavanol absorption was enhanced when tea polyphenols were administered as a green tea supplement in capsule form and led to a small but significant increase in plasma antioxidant activity compared with when tea polyphenols were consumed as black tea or green tea. All 3 interventions provided similar amounts of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate.,Our observations suggest that green tea extract supplements retain the beneficial effects of green and black tea and may be used in future chemoprevention studies to provide a large dose of tea polyphenols without the side effects of caffeine associated with green and black tea beverages.

The latter three sites treat many underserved patients.Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (N = 246) under age 60.Experimental group received Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS), a home-based computer system providing information, decision-making, and emotional support.","Pretest and two post-test surveys (at two- and five-month follow-up) measured aspects of participation in care, social/information support, and quality of life. At two-month follow-up, the CHESS group was significantly more competent at seeking information, more comfortable participating in care, and had greater confidence in doctor(s). At five-month follow-up, the CHESS group had significantly better social support and also greater information competence. In addition, experimental assignment interacted with several indicators of medical underservice (race, education, and lack of insurance), such that CHESS benefits were greater for the disadvantaged than the advantaged group.","Computer-based patient support systems such as CHESS may benefit patients by providing information and social support, and increasing their participation in health care.

1496,14594788,"Older persons are at risk of both poor nutrition and increased oxidative stress. Plasma ascorbate concentrations fall with increasing age, and concentrations of other antioxidants may also be reduced.The goal was to examine the association between antioxidants and mortality in older persons.","We randomly selected persons aged 75-84 y from the lists of 51 British family practitioners taking part in a randomized trial of assessment of older persons. A total of 1214 participants provided a blood sample and were interviewed about their usual diet with the use of a food-frequency questionnaire. Statistical analyses were based on deaths after a median of 4.4 y of follow-up, and hazard ratios were estimated for quintiles of dietary or blood antioxidants.","We found strong inverse trends for blood ascorbate concentrations with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, which were only marginally reduced after adjustment for confounders or supplement use.

After adjustment for other factors that influence adherence, at 6\u00a0months postrandomization, only baseline VO2max was associated with higher aerobic exercise levels and at 12\u00a0months, only older age predicted better supervised exercise training attendance.","Breast cancer survivors taking AIs and experiencing arthralgia are able to initiate and maintain a year long exercise program, regardless of other factors that influence activity levels.Breast cancer survivors can exercise at levels that have been shown to improve AI-associated arthralgia."
1499,11903704,"To investigate the role of district nurses in the care of cancer patients with chronic pain at home, as well as the effects of a Pain Education Programme for patients and their district nurses. The Pain Education Programme consisted of a tailored multi-method approach in which they were educated about pain, instructed how to report pain, and how to contact health care providers.No educational programs for patients in pain have been studied in outpatients nor integrated with the home care provided.","One hundred and four patients and their 115 district nurses were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal, randomized controlled study. The primary outcome of interest was type of care provided by district nurses, satisfaction with the pain treatment, and agreement in estimating patients' pain intensity.","Results showed that continuity of care was poor as only 36% of the district nurses were informed about patients' pain by hospital nurses. Pain was rarely the reason for referring the patient to district nursing after discharge. Although pain control was not a main reason for district nurses to visit a patient, pain was a subject for discussion in 76% of visits. Besides discussing the pain problem with patients, district nurses provided only a few pain-relieving interventions. District nurses randomized to the intervention group significantly better estimated patients' pain intensity, and were more satisfied about patients' pain treatment, but no differences were found in their assessment of patients' pain relief.","These findings suggest a significant but moderate effect of the Pain Education Programme, with district nurses only playing a minor role in the treatment of cancer pain."
1500,28202500,"Walking is an adaptable, inexpensive and accessible form of physical activity. However, its impact on quality of life (QoL) and symptom severity in people with advanced cancer is unknown. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a community-based walking intervention to enhance QoL in people with recurrent/metastatic cancer.","We used a mixed-methods design comprising a 2-centre RCT and nested qualitative interviews.Patients with advanced breast, prostate, gynaecological or haematological cancers randomised 1:1 between intervention and usual care.The intervention comprised Macmillan's 'Move More' information, a short motivational interview with a recommendation to walk for at least 30\u2005min on alternate days and attend a volunteer-led group walk weekly.","We assessed feasibility and acceptability of the intervention  RCT by evaluating study processes (rates of recruitment, consent, retention, adherence and adverse events), and using end-of-study questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) assessing QoL, activity, fatigue, mood and self-efficacy were completed at baseline and 6, 12 and 24\u2005weeks.We recruited 42 (38%) eligible participants. Recruitment was lower than anticipated (goal n=60), the most commonly reported reason being unable to commit to walking groups (n=19). Randomisation procedures worked well with groups evenly matched for age, sex and activity. By week 24, there was a 45% attrition rate. Most PROMs while acceptable were not sensitive to change and did not capture key benefits.","The intervention was acceptable, well tolerated and the study design was judged acceptable and feasible. Results are encouraging and demonstrate that exercise was popular and conveyed benefit to participants. Consequently, an effectiveness RCT is warranted, with some modifications to the intervention to include greater tailoring and more appropriate PROMs selected."
1501,17284748,"Animal studies suggest that prebiotics and probiotics exert protective effects against tumor development in the colon, but human data supporting this suggestion are weak.The objective was to verify whether the prebiotic concept (selective interaction with colonic flora of nondigested carbohydrates) as induced by a synbiotic preparation-oligofructose-enriched inulin (SYN1) + Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12 (BB12)-is able to reduce the risk of colon cancer in humans.","The 12-wk randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a synbiotic food composed of the prebiotic SYN1 and probiotics LGG and BB12 was conducted in 37 colon cancer patients and 43 polypectomized patients. Fecal and blood samples were obtained before, during, and after the intervention, and colorectal biopsy samples were obtained before and after the intervention. The effect of synbiotic consumption on a battery of intermediate bio-markers for colon cancer was examined.",Synbiotic intervention resulted in significant changes in fecal flora: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus increased and Clostridium perfringens decreased. The intervention significantly reduced colorectal proliferation and the capacity of fecal water to induce necrosis in colonic cells and improve epithelial barrier function in polypectomized patients. Genotoxicity assays of colonic biopsy samples indicated a decreased exposure to genotoxins in polypectomized patients at the end of the intervention period. Synbiotic consumption prevented an increased secretion of interleukin 2 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the polypectomized patients and increased the production of interferon gamma in the cancer patients.,Several colorectal cancer biomarkers can be altered favorably by synbiotic intervention.

Church-based programs may be more effective if they are spiritually based in nature.The aims of the present study were to implement and provide an initial evaluation of a spiritually based prostate cancer screening informed decision making intervention for African-American men who attend church, and determine its efficacy for increasing informed decision making.","Churches were randomized to receive either the spiritually based or the non-spiritual intervention. Trained community health advisors, who were African-American male church members, led an educational session and distributed educational print materials. Participants completed baseline and immediate follow-up surveys to assess the intervention impact on study outcomes.","The spiritually based intervention appeared to be more effective in areas such as knowledge, and men read more of their materials in the spiritually based group than in the non-spiritual group.",Further examination of the efficacy of the spiritually based approach to health communication is warranted.

Participants were newly diagnosed with stage III, stage IV, or recurrent cancer (solid tumor or non-Hodgkin lymphoma), undergoing chemotherapy, cognitively intact, and able to read and speak English.Data were gathered via telephone interviews at baseline and 10 and 20 weeks after randomization. Nurses with experience in oncology delivered a five-contact, eight-week intervention aimed at teaching patients problem-solving techniques to affect symptom severity.Gender, site of cancer, age, symptom severity and depressive symptoms at baseline, group (i.e., experimental versus control), and total symptom severity.","Patients in the experimental group and those with lower symptom severity at baseline had significantly lower symptom severity at 10 and 20 weeks; the experimental difference at 20 weeks occurred primarily in those 60 years of age and younger. Depressive symptoms at baseline predicted symptom severity at 20 weeks; however, age, gender, and site of cancer did not affect symptom severity at either time point.","A cognitive behavioral intervention to teach problem-solving skills can be effective for patient symptom self-management during and following an intervention.Problem-solving strategies should be included in educational programs for patients with advanced cancer, particularly those 60 years of age and younger."
1505,28178355,"Wingless and integration site growth factor (Wnt) signaling is a tumorigenesis-related signaling pathway. Dickkpof-1 (DKK1) and secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (SFRP1) are endogenous negative regulators of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Accumulating evidence indicates that higher serum levels of DKK1 are correlated with poor prognosis of various types of cancer. Here, we investigated whether exercise training causes changes in the serum levels of DKK1 and SFRP1 in patients with breast cancer.","Twenty-four breast cancer survivors, after chemo- or radiotherapy, participated in this single-blind randomized, controlled pilot study. Subjects were randomized to either an exercise program or a control group for 12 weeks and completed pre- and post-training tests for health-related fitness and body composition as well as blood biomarkers. The serum levels of DKK1 and SFRP1 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as the primary outcome.","Exercise training for 12 weeks remarkably increased muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility and decreased body fat percentage, waist circumference, and visceral fat area (all p &lt; 0.05). Exercise training lowered serum insulin levels and leptin/adiponectin ratios (all p &lt; 0.05). The levels of DKK1 and SFRP1 were also significantly decreased by exercise training in breast cancer survivors (all p &lt; 0.01).",Our results indicate that DKK1 and SFRP1 may be potentially useful biomarkers for evaluating the beneficial effects of long-term exercise on physical fitness and metabolism as well as the prognosis of patients with cancer.

Data were collected with a brief interview, questionnaires, objective hot flash monitoring, and wrist actigraphy.Hot flash occurrence, severity, bother, mood disturbance, affect, hot flash disruption, and sleep disturbance.","The DVD was a feasible and acceptable method for intervention delivery. Although participants expressed difficulty in applying the intervention in certain situations, they also described benefits that included shorter hot flash duration (not measured in this study). Paired t tests showed significant but minor decreases in worst hot flash severity, worst hot flash bother, mood, and disruption of daily activities.","The DVD was an acceptable way to deliver the intervention. However, the intervention will need to be improved before being tested in a larger study.A cognitive-behavioral intervention may be a useful adjunct or alternative to current hot flash treatments. Findings will be used to modify the intervention and data collection methods before undertaking a larger study."

Acupuncture is being accepted as an option for reducing POI and managing various functional gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, this pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effect of acupuncture on reducing duration of POI and other surgical outcomes in patients who underwent gastric surgery.","A prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study was conducted on patients who underwent gastric cancer surgery from January 2013 to December 2013. Ten patients were randomly assigned into the acupuncture (A) or nonacupuncture (NA) groups at a 1:1 ratio.The acupuncture treatment was performed by Korean traditional medicine doctors (KMDs). The style of acupuncture was Korean. In the A group, acupuncture treatment was given once daily for 5 consecutive days starting on postoperative day 1. Each patient received acupuncture at 16 acupoints based on expert consensus provided by qualified and experienced KMDs. No acupuncture treatment was performed in the NA group.The primary outcome measure was the number of remnant Sitz markers in the small intestine on abdominal radiography.

Although 5-year survival rates approach 98%, all treatment options carry the possibility for significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. It is therefore recommended that patients be actively involved in the treatment decision process. We have developed an Internet/CD-ROM-based multimedia Prostate Interactive Educational System (PIES) to enhance patients' treatment decision making. PIES virtually mirrors a health center to provide patients with information about prostate cancer and its treatment through an intuitive interface, using videos, animations, graphics, and texts.(1) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of the PIES intervention and to report preliminary outcomes of the program in a pilot trial among patients with a new prostate cancer diagnosis, and (2) to explore the potential impact of tailoring PIES treatment information to participants' information-seeking styles on study outcomes.","Participants (n = 72) were patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer who had not made a treatment decision. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 experimental conditions: (1) control condition (providing information through standard National Cancer Institute brochures; 26%), and PIES (2) with tailoring (43%) and (3) without tailoring to a patient's information-seeking style (31%). Questionnaires were administrated before (t1) and immediately after the intervention (t2). Measurements include evaluation and acceptability of the PIES intervention, monitoring/blunting information-seeking style, psychological distress, and decision-related variables (eg, decisional confidence, feeling informed about prostate cancer and treatment, and treatment preference).","The PIES program was well accepted by patients and did not interfere with the clinical routine. About 79% of eligible patients (72/91) completed the pre- and post-PIES intervention assessments. Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly more likely to report higher levels of confidence in their treatment choices, higher levels of helpfulness of the information they received in making a treatment decision, and that the information they received was emotionally reassuring. Patients in the PIES groups compared with those in the control condition were significantly less likely to need more information about treatment options, were less anxious about their treatment choices, and thought the information they received was clear (P &lt; .05). Tailoring PIES information to information-seeking style was not related to decision-making variables.",This pilot study confirms that the implementation of PIES within a clinical practice is feasible and acceptable to patients with a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer. PIES improved key decision-making process variables and reduced the emotional impact of a difficult medical decision.
1520,19722727,"All licensed medicines in the European Union must be provided with a Patient Information Leaflet that includes a list of all known side effects. Among patients who read the leaflet, the side effects section is the most often read. A UK government regulatory publication recommends providing medicine side effect risk information in a combined format, using verbal descriptors accompanied by numerical information.This study, with users of an existing popular patient information website, investigates the effectiveness of presenting medicine side effect risk information in different forms.","Participants were randomly allocated to one of the three formats for representing risk information (verbal descriptors, e.g. 'common'; absolute frequencies, e.g. 'less than 1 in 10 people'; and a combination of verbal descriptors and frequency bands, e.g. 'common (affects less than 1 in 10 people)'.Participants (n = 187) were recruited from users of the Cancer Research UK patient information website. They were asked to imagine that they had to take a cancer treatment (tamoxifen), estimate the risks of four side effects occurring, and complete Likert scales relating to their satisfaction with the information supplied and perceived likelihood of various outcomes.","Those in the absolute frequency format demonstrated greater accuracy in estimating the likelihood of having two of four side effects than the other two formats. They were also more accurate at estimating the likelihood of themselves or the average person having any side effect from taking tamoxifen. Participants in the absolute frequency format rated the risk to health from tamoxifen as lower than those in the other two formats, were more satisfied with the information they received than those in the verbal format, and felt there would be less impact of the information on tamoxifen use than those in the combined format.","These findings fail to confirm that the recommended use of combined descriptors for medicine side effects is unequivocally superior to absolute frequency alone. They also add weight to the growing body of research highlighting the deficiencies in using verbal descriptors for conveying side effect risk, and the strength of using absolute frequency descriptors."
1521,30525855,"patients with cervical cancer (CC) receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy have several gastrointestinal adverse effects.to evaluate the effect of dietary symbiotic supplementation on fecal calprotectin (FCP), bacterial DNA levels, and gastrointestinal adverse effects in patients with CC.","clinical, controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. Patients consumed symbiotics or placebo three times a day for seven weeks. FCP was assessed by Elisa method. DNA from probiotic and pathogenic bacteria were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Diarrheal evacuations were evaluated with the Bristol stool form scale and nausea and vomiting were measured using the scale of the National Institute of Cancerology of the United States.","after a seven-week treatment, FCP concentration was lower in the symbiotic group compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Stool consistency in the placebo and symbiotic groups was similar at baseline. A significant improvement in stool consistency was obtained in both groups at the end of the intervention (p &lt; 0.001). The concentrations and total proportions of the probiotic and pathogenic bacteria were similar in both groups. Nausea significantly diminished in both groups (p &lt; 0.001) at the end of the trial. Furthermore, the symbiotic group had a statistically significant decrease in the frequency and intensity of vomiting when compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001).",the symbiotic treatment decreases significantly the FCP levels and the frequency and intensity of vomiting in patients with CC.
1522,15054339,The objectives of this study were to assess the types of dietary changes made by women who successfully reduced their fat intake in response to low-fat diet instruction and to evaluate the effects of these changes on nutrient intake.,"Two hundred women enrolled in the low-fat intervention arm of the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) were randomly selected. Woman whose baseline fat intake was less than 20% energy from fat were excluded from the study, resulting in a total population of 163. These women were categorized into either the strictly adherent (SA) (those who met their fat gram goal and reported less than 20 % calories from fat, n=50) or the not strictly adherent (NSA) (those who exceeded their fat gram goal and reported 20% or greater calories from fat, n=113) group. The food choices made by SA and NSA subjects were analyzed to identify those that promoted greater adherence.The participants were free-living women who had been instructed to follow a diet that would meet a specific fat gram goal calculated to provide 15% of calories from fat.Descriptive statistics were used to describe food groups and subgroups. t tests were used to determine statistical significance between and within groups. chi(2) analysis was used to assess differences in demographic variables.","There were no marked differences in food patterns of the SA and NSA subjects when compared with the Food Guide Pyramid (FGP) recommendations. Both met FGP serving recommendations at baseline. At 12 months, both showed reductions in the number of servings from fats and oils; SA subjects showed a greater reduction (from 4.18+/-3.6 to 3.0+/-2.4) as well as a reduction in servings from the bread group intake (5.7+/-2.2 to 4.8+/-2.1). Evaluation of food subgroups from within FGP groups showed strategies that promoted fat reduction, such as reducing portion sizes of high-fat foods. The use of these strategies was greater in the SA subjects. The reduction in fat intake had little impact on nutrient adequacy. SA and NSA subjects reduced energy intake from baseline to follow-up, with SA subjects reporting lower intakes. There were few differences in nutrient intakes between the SA and NSA subjects at either time period.",The results from this study suggest specific strategies that promote successful reduction in fat intake without compromising nutrient intake. This information can be used to guide others in making dietary changes.
1523,20832982,"Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States and is associated with high levels of symptoms, including pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and psychological distress. Caregivers and patients are adversely affected. However, previous studies of coping skills training (CST) interventions have not been tested in patients with lung cancer nor have systematically included caregivers.This study tested the efficacy of a caregiver-assisted CST protocol in a sample of patients with lung cancer.","Two hundred thirty-three lung cancer patients and their caregivers were randomly assigned to receive 14 telephone-based sessions of either caregiver-assisted CST or education/support involving the caregiver. Patients completed measures assessing pain, psychological distress, quality of life (QOL), and self-efficacy for symptom management; caregivers completed measures assessing psychological distress, caregiver strain, and self-efficacy for helping the patient manage symptoms.","Patients in both treatment conditions showed improvements in pain, depression, QOL, and self-efficacy, and caregivers in both conditions showed improvements in anxiety and self-efficacy from baseline to four-month follow-up. Results of exploratory analyses suggested that the CST intervention was more beneficial to patients/caregivers with Stage II and III cancers, whereas the education/support intervention was more beneficial to patients/caregivers with Stage I cancer.","Taken together with the broader literature in this area, results from this study suggest that psychosocial interventions can lead to improvements in a range of outcomes for cancer patients. Suggestions for future studies include the use of three-group designs (e.g., comparing two active interventions with a standard-care control) and examining mechanisms of change."
1524,23151126,"The severe iatrogenic hypogonadal state induced by medical castration used for treatment of prostate cancer is associated with adverse effects including fatigue, increased fracture risk, and a decrease in skeletal muscle function, which negatively impact quality of life. We have previously reported beneficial changes in healthy lifestyle behaviors, physical function and fatigue as a result of a novel combined exercise and dietary advice intervention (a lifestyle intervention) in men with prostate cancer on androgen suppression therapy (AST). The aim of this research was to conduct a qualitative evaluation of the lifestyle intervention in these men with advanced prostate cancer receiving androgen suppression therapy (AST).",Twelve men with prostate cancer on AST took part in three focus groups in a UK higher education institution following the 12 week intervention. Sessions lasted between 45 and 60 minutes in duration. All discussions were audio-taped and transcribed. A framework analysis approach was applied to the focus group data. An initial coding framework was developed from a priori issues listed in the topic guide and extended and refined following initial familiarization with the focus group transcripts. Line by line indexing of the transcripts was undertaken iteratively to allow for the incorporation of new codes. Coded sections of text were grouped together (charted) into themes and subthemes prior to a further process of comparison and interpretation.,None of the participants involved in the trial were provided with information on how lifestyle changes might be beneficial to men with prostate cancer during the course of their standard medical treatment. We present novel findings that this intervention was considered beneficial for reducing anxiety around treatment and fear of disease progression. Men were supportive of the benefits of the intervention over conventional cancer survival discussion group arrangements as it facilitated peer support in addition to physical rehabilitation.,The benefits of lifestyle changes in men with prostate cancer are not well appreciated by care providers despite a range of benefits becoming apparent. Strategies to implement exercise and dietary interventions in standard care should be further evaluated.
1525,21931958,"There is increasing evidence showing beneficial effects of mindfulness and mindfulness training on various indicators of mental and physical health.This paper reports the 6-month follow-up effects of a mindfulness stress reduction training program among patients treated for cancer on perceived stress, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, positive states of mind, coping self-efficacy, and mindfulness.",Patients with a previous cancer diagnosis were recruited and randomized into an intervention group or a waiting list control group. The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness training course.,"Compared to participants in the control group, the intervention group showed a larger increase in mindfulness at 6-month follow-up. However, there were no differences on any of the other outcomes between the intervention and control groups. Continued meditation practice was associated with a significant reduction in post-traumatic stress symptoms of avoidance.",The study draws attention to the need to better understand the mechanisms behind the effect of mindfulness training and to potential modification of mindfulness interventions to promote sustained benefits over time.
1526,30229691,"Chronic inflammation is associated with numerous chronic diseases and can be managed with diet.The purpose of this study was to examine differences in baseline characteristics and plasma inflammation levels between two groups of participants that participated in an intensive, lifestyle intervention or a remotely delivered intervention. This work also assessed the association between Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) scores and participants' inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers at baseline.","Ninety-five participants (61 intervention, 34 control) chose to enroll in either a 12-month intervention consisting of a face-to-face nutrition, physical activity, and stress management intervention or a remotely-delivered intervention (control group) focusing on general cancer prevention. The intervention group met at the University of South Carolina for classes and the control group had materials emailed to them. A quantile regression was used to compare participants' high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the association between DII scores and biomarkers.","There were significant differences in age, body mass index, body fat percentage, and blood pressure between groups, but there were no differences in levels of inflammatory biomarkers. Values of interleukin-6 at the 90th percentile of its distribution were 8.31 pg/ml higher among those in DII quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 ( p = 0.02). All other outcomes were not significant.","Given similar levels of inflammatory biomarkers, participants opting for the control group would also have benefited from a more intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on reducing inflammation."
1527,23436910,Maintenance acupuncture is advocated by clinicians after successful clinic-based acupuncture. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of maintenance acupuncture in the management of cancer-related fatigue (CRF); treatment delivered by therapists or self-acupuncture/self-needling was compared with no maintenance treatment.,"Breast cancer patients who participated in a randomized trial of acupuncture for CRF management (reported elsewhere) were re-randomized to receive an additional four acupuncturist-delivered weekly sessions; four self-administered weekly acupuncture sessions (self-needling); or no acupuncture. Primary outcome was general fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory). Mood, quality of life and safety were also assessed.","In total, 197 patients were re-randomized, with 65 to therapist-delivered sessions, 67 to self-acupuncture/self-needling and 65 to no further acupuncture. Primary outcome scores were equivalent between the therapist-delivered acupuncture and self-acupuncture (P &gt; 0.05). A non-significant trend in improving fatigue was observed at the end of 4 weeks in the combined acupuncture arms (P = 0.07). There was no impact on mood or quality of life of the further acupuncture sessions at 18 weeks beyond the improvement observed in initial trial.","Self-acupuncture is an acceptable, feasible and safe maintenance treatment for patients with CRF. However, overall, maintenance acupuncture did not yield important improvements beyond those observed after an initial clinic-based course of acupuncture."
1528,19180530,"Patients with cancer have relatively high rates of anxiety and distress, adversely affecting their well-being and quality of life. Recent studies indicate that addressing these symptoms could result in better response to cancer treatment. Researchers have found that interventions that focus on increasing mental awareness and the frequency of positive experiences may have a greater impact on reducing psychological morbidity and increasing quality of life than interventions that target relief of psychological symptoms.To develop and test a brief, easy to use intervention that could improve well-being and quality of life in cancer patients.","We developed a simple well-being intervention that made few demands on patient time and required little training resource. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a deferred entry group. Measures of anxiety, depression, well-being and quality of life were administered at baseline and at follow-ups.",Twenty-two women with metastatic breast cancer and 24 men with metastatic prostate cancer were recruited from oncology clinics. Thirteen women and 14 men completed the study. Both qualitative and quantitative data showed that the intervention was acceptable to users. There was statistically significant improvement in quality of life scores on WHOQOL-BREF post-intervention (p=0.046). Compliance with the intervention was good.,"This brief well-being intervention appears to be a promising technique for improving quality of life of cancer patients, without making undue demands on staff resources or patient time. If further studies confirm its effectiveness, it could prove to be a cost-effective intervention."
1529,24804884,A treatment-as-usual randomized wait-list controlled trial was conducted to investigate the feasibility and impact of an online synchronous Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) group program for underserved distressed cancer survivors.,Sixty-two men and women exhibiting moderate to high distress within 3 years of completing primary cancer treatment without access to in-person MBCR were randomized to either immediate online MBCR (n = 30) or to wait for the next available program (n = 32). Participants completed questionnaires preintervention and postintervention or wait period online. Program evaluations were completed after MBCR. Feasibility was tracked through monitoring eligibility and participation through the protocol. Intent-to-treat mixed-model analyses for repeated measures were conducted.,"Feasibility targets for recruitment and retention were achieved, and participants were satisfied and would recommend online MBCR. There were significant improvements and moderate Cohen d effect sizes in the online MBCR group relative to controls after MBCR for total scores of mood disturbance (d = 0.44, p = .049), stress symptoms (d = 0.49, p = .021), spirituality (d = 0.37, p = .040), and mindfully acting with awareness (d = 0.50, p = .026). Main effects of time were observed for posttraumatic growth and remaining mindfulness facets.","Results provide evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of an online adaptation of MBCR for the reduction of mood disturbance and stress symptoms, as well as an increase in spirituality and mindfully acting with awareness compared with a treatment-as-usual wait-list. Future study using larger active control RCT designs is warranted."
1530,17149401,To assess the effect of an educational homecare program on pain relief in patients with advanced cancer.,"Quasi-experimental (pretest post-test, nonequivalent group).Four community-based primary care centers providing social and healthcare services in the Quebec City region of Canada.80 homecare patients with advanced cancer who were free of cognitive impairment, who presented with pain or were taking analgesics to relieve pain, and who had a life expectancy of six weeks or longer.The educational intervention included information regarding pain assessment and monitoring using a daily pain diary and the provision of specific recommendations in case of loss of pain control. Pain intensity data were collected prior to the intervention, and reassessments were made two and four weeks later. Data on beliefs were collected at baseline and two weeks. All data were collected by personal interviews.Patients beliefs about the use of opioids; average and maximum pain intensities.",Patients beliefs regarding the use of opioids were modified successfully following the educational intervention. Average pain was unaffected in the control group and was reduced significantly in patients who received the educational program. The reduction remained after controlling for patients initial beliefs. Maximum pain decreased significantly over time in both the experimental and control groups.,An educational intervention can be effective in improving the monitoring and relief of pain in patients with cancer living at home.Homecare nurses can be trained to effectively administer the educational program during their regular homecare visits.
1531,24731917,"Many women experience emotional distress, depression and anxiety after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Psychological stress and depression have been associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation that may adversely affect immune system functioning and impact upon survival. This study investigated the effects of a lifestyle intervention on indices of psychological health status, HPA axis regulation and immune function in overweight women recovering from early-stage breast cancer treatment.","A total of 85 women treated for breast cancer 3 to 18 months previously were randomly allocated to a 6-month exercise and hypocaloric healthy eating program plus usual care or usual care alone (control group). Women in the intervention group received three supervised exercise sessions per week and individualized dietary advice, supplemented by weekly nutrition seminars. Depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory version II: BDI-II), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale: PSS), salivary diurnal cortisol rhythms; inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), leukocyte phenotype counts, natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and lymphocyte proliferation following mitogenic stimulation were assessed at baseline and 6-month follow up.","Compared with the control group, the intervention group exhibited a reduction in depressive symptoms (adjusted mean difference, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): -3.12, -1.03 to -5.26; P\u2009=\u20090.004) at the 6-month follow-up but no significant decrease in PSS scores (-2.07, -4.96 to 0.82; P\u2009=\u20090.16). The lifestyle intervention also had a significant impact on diurnal salivary cortisol rhythm compared with usual care alone, as evidenced by an increase in morning salivary cortisol at the 6-month follow-up (P &lt;0.04), indicating a change in HPA axis regulation. Women in the control group had higher total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in comparison to the intervention group at the 6-month follow-up (P \u22640.05), whereas there was no difference in NK cell counts (P\u2009=\u20090.46), NK cell cytotoxicity (P\u2009=\u20090.85) or lymphocyte proliferation responses (P\u2009=\u20090.11) between the two groups.",Our results show that the lifestyle intervention resulted in a reduction in depressive symptoms and a normalisation of HPA axis regulation. Such changes could have important implications for long-term survival in women recovering from early-breast cancer treatment.
1532,19615313,"Recently the maintenance therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who completed required treatment cycles has caused widespread interests in the medical field.

1533,29770553,To develop and test a volitional help sheet-based tool to improve physical activity in breast cancer survivors compared to a standard self-generated implementation intention intervention.,"Pilot randomized trial conducted online over 3\u00a0months.Participants were randomized to an online volitional help sheet (n\u00a0=\u00a050) or implementation intention (n\u00a0=\u00a051) intervention. Measures were taken at baseline, 1 and 3\u00a0months. The main outcome measure was moderate-strenuous leisure time\u00a0physical activity. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life and mood.","Participants exposed to the volitional help sheet and implementation intention interventions showed similar effects after 1\u00a0month, with both groups reporting a significant increase in moderate-strenuous physical activity. After 3\u00a0months, the initial increase in physical activity was maintained by the volitional help sheet group, but not the implementation intention group. Improvements were also found for negative affect and emotional quality of life.","While both interventions show promise in promoting physical activity in breast cancer survivors, the volitional help sheet may be more effective for facilitating lasting change and emotional well-being. Findings suggest that the volitional help sheet may have potential to offer a cost-effective contribution to consumer-led tertiary preventive health. Future research should test these initial findings in a definitive trial. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Physical activity is important for optimizing health in breast cancer survivors. Despite this, physical activity in this cohort remains low. Theory-based strategies are needed to help breast cancer survivors independently manage and maintain regular physical activity over the long term. What does this study add? Online planning interventions can improve physical activity in breast cancer survivors. Volitional help sheets, but not implementation intentions, show sustained effects for 3\u00a0months. The intervention shows promise as a potential low-cost addition to long-term survivorship care plans."
1534,17147966,We sought to identify mediating variables that may explain the increased effectiveness of a partner-learning skin self-examination (SSE) skills training program over a solo-learning SSE skills training program in a sample of patients at risk for melanoma.,"We conducted a randomized control design with pretest, immediate posttest, and 4-month follow-up measures in a clinical ambulatory care office of a hospital. In all, 130 participants were drawn from a melanoma hospital registry and randomly assigned to a solo-learning control group (n = 65) or a partner-learning group (n = 65). Participants either received the skills training individually in the solo-learning control group or in the partner-learning group in which a partner was actively involved in the training. The intervention consisted of a 10-minute educational presentation and skills training session about the ABCDE rule of early melanoma detection. The main outcome measure was SSE performance as measured by use of a body map. The mediators measured included attitudes toward SSE, self-efficacy/confidence in the ability to effectively perform SSE, comfort with having a partner help with SSE, perceived melanoma/skin cancer risk, concern about developing skin cancer/skin damage, and melanoma/skin cancer knowledge.","Attitudes toward SSE, self-efficacy, comfort with having someone help with SSE, and concern about developing sun-damaged skin were found to be significant mediators.","Study limitations include sample size, the evaluation of short-term program effects, and partner relationship variables that could influence the effectiveness of partner learning.Involvement of a partner in the SSE skills training was more effective than solo learning because of the changes in the above-mentioned mediators. Future SSE skills training programs could benefit through using approaches that produce changes in key variables such as increasing attitudes toward SSE, increasing self-efficacy beliefs in the ability to perform SSE, and making participants feel confident in their ability to examine their skin."
1535,23128366,"New methods to enhance colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates are needed. The web offers novel possibilities to educate patients and to improve health behaviors, such as cancer screening. Evidence supports the efficacy of health communications that are targeted and tailored to improve the uptake of recommendations.",We identified unscreened women at average risk for CRC from the scheduling databases of obstetrics and gynecology practices in 2 large health care systems. Participants consented to a randomized controlled trial that compared CRC screening uptake after receipt of CRC screening information delivered via the web or in print form. Participants could also be assigned to a control (usual care) group. Women in the interventional arms received tailored information in a high- or low-monitoring Cognitive Social Information Processing model-defined attentional style. The primary outcome was CRC screening participation at 4 months.,"A total of 904 women were randomized to the interventional or control group. At 4 months, CRC screening uptake was not significantly different in the web (12.2%), print (12.0%), or control (12.9%) group. Attentional style had no effect on screening uptake for any group. Some baseline participant factors were associated with greater screening, including higher income (P = .03), stage of change (P &lt; .001), and physician recommendation to screen (P &lt; .001).","A web-based educational intervention was no more effective than a print-based one or control (no educational intervention) in increasing CRC screening rates in women at average risk of CRC. Risk messages tailored to attentional style had no effect on screening uptake. In average-risk populations, use of the Internet for health communication without additional enhancement is unlikely to improve screening participation."

The patients in the gum-chewing group chewed sugarless gum 3 times daily for 1 hour each time until discharge. Patient demographics, intraoperative, and postoperative care were equivalent between the 2 groups. All gum-chewing patients tolerated the gum. The first passage of flatus occurred on postoperative hour 65.4 in the gum-chewing group and on hour 80.2 in the control group (P = .05). The first bowel movement occurred on postoperative hour 63.2 in the gum-chewing group and on hour 89.4 in the control group (P = .04). The first feelings of hunger were felt on postoperative hour 63.5 in the gum-chewing group and on hour 72.8 in the control group (P = .27). There were no major complications in either group. The total length of hospital stay was shorter in the gum-chewing group (day 4.3) than in the control group (day 6.8), (P = .01).",Gum chewing speeds recovery after elective open sigmoid resection by stimulating bowel motility. Gum chewing is an inexpensive and helpful adjunct to postoperative care after colectomy.
1537,25342388,"An inactive lifestyle is a risk factor for several types of cancer. A proposed pathway through which exercise influences cancer risk is via insulin. We aim to investigate the effect of a one-year exercise intervention on insulin sensitivity, and the role of body fat in this association, in healthy, normal to overweight/obese, postmenopausal women.","In the Sex Hormones And Physical Exercise (SHAPE) study, 189 healthy, inactive and postmenopausal women [ages, 50-69 years; body mass index (BMI), 22-40 kg/m(2)] were randomly assigned to a one-year aerobic and strength exercise intervention (150 min/wk), or a control group. Between-group differences in fasting insulin, glucose, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2) over time were estimated using linear mixed models.","Follow-up measurements of insulin sensitivity were available for 181 (95.8%) and 182 (96.3%) women at 4 and 12 months, respectively.

Similar results were found in a per protocol analysis in compliant women, and in a subgroup of women who lost &gt;2% body fat [measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)].","Participation in a one-year aerobic and strength exercise intervention program did not result in changes in insulin sensitivity in healthy postmenopausal and inactive women.Our findings suggest that 150 min/wk of exercise, as recommended by current guidelines, is not enough to achieve improvements in insulin sensitivity and subsequent cancer risk, in healthy postmenopausal women."
1538,25257238,This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of an aerobic exercise programme on fatigue for Taiwanese breast cancer women under radiotherapy (RT).Cancer-related fatigue has been widely reported by patients undergoing radiotherapy as strongly and profoundly interfering with their quality of life. Evidence has shown that exercise can be beneficial to patients with breast cancer.,A quasi-experimental design was used.Patients with early-stage breast cancer scheduled for radiotherapy were invited to participate. The first 28 women who agreed to participate were assigned to the intervention group with a six-week mild- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training programme during their radiotherapy. The next 30 women were assigned to the routine care control group without special exercise intervention. Fatigue was measured at pre-radiotherapy and weekly after starting radiotherapy for six weeks using the Taiwanese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory.,"The mean age of these 47 women was 50\u00b73 years (standard deviation = 9\u00b75). The baseline fatigue severity for the intervention group and control group were 3\u00b704 and 2\u00b795 respectively; and the baseline fatigue interference for the intervention group and the control group were 3\u00b748 and 3\u00b755 respectively. The student t-test showed no group differences in baseline fatigue severity, fatigue interference, or haemoglobin levels. Multivariate analyses showed a significant group-by-time-interaction effect for fatigue severity and interference (p \u2266 0\u00b7001); the fatigue severity and interference decreased significantly over time for women in the intervention group but increased over time for women in the control group.",The mild- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programme reduces the fatigue of Taiwanese women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy. The issues of cancer-related fatigue should also be discussed as they relate to other treatment modalities.Aerobic exercise intervention should be offered as an option for women with breast cancer to alleviate cancer-related fatigue when undergoing radiotherapy.
1539,29243164,"Over half of all cancer patients receiving taxane-, platinum-, or vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which includes numbness, tingling, pain, cold sensitivity, and motor impairment in the hands and feet. CIPN is a dose-limiting toxicity, potentially increasing mortality. There are no FDA-approved drugs to treat CIPN, and behavioral interventions such as exercise are promising yet understudied. This secondary analysis of our nationwide phase III randomized controlled trial of exercise for fatigue examines (1) effects of exercise on CIPN symptoms, (2) factors that predict CIPN symptoms, and (3) factors that moderate effects of exercise on CIPN symptoms.","Cancer patients (N\u2009=\u2009355, 56\u2009\u00b1\u200911\u00a0years, 93% female, 79% breast cancer) receiving taxane-, platinum-, or vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy were randomized to chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP\u00a9\u00ae). EXCAP is a standardized, individualized, moderate-intensity, home-based, six-week progressive walking and resistance exercise program. Patients reported CIPN symptoms of numbness and tingling and hot/coldness in hands/feet (0-10 scales) pre- and post-intervention. We explored baseline neuropathy, sex, age, body mass index, cancer stage, and cancer type as possible factors associated with CIPN symptoms and exercise effectiveness.","Exercise reduced CIPN symptoms of hot/coldness in hands/feet (-0.46\u00a0units, p\u2009=\u20090.045) and numbness and tingling (-\u20090.42\u00a0units, p\u2009=\u20090.061) compared to the control. Exercise reduced CIPN symptoms more for patients who were older (p\u2009=\u20090.086), male (p\u2009=\u20090.028), or had breast cancer (p\u2009=\u20090.076).","Exercise appears to reduce CIPN symptoms in patients receiving taxane-, platinum-, or vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy. Clinicians should consider prescribing exercise for these patients."
1540,28981596,"Major abdominal oncology surgery is associated with substantial postoperative loss of functional capacity, and exercise may be an effective intervention to improve outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess efficacy, feasibility and safety of a supervised postoperative exercise programme.","We performed a single-blind, parallel-arm, randomized trial in patients who underwent major abdominal oncology surgery in a tertiary university hospital. Patients were randomized to an early mobilization postoperative programme based on supervised aerobic exercise, resistance and flexibility training or to standard rehabilitation care. The primary outcome was inability to walk without human assistance at postoperative day 5 or hospital discharge.","A total of 108 patients were enrolled, 54 into the early mobilization programme group and 54 into the standard rehabilitation care group. The incidence of the primary outcome was nine (16.7%) and 21 (38.9%), respectively (P=0.01), with an absolute risk reduction of 22.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.9-38.6] and a number needed to treat of 5 (95% CI 3-17). All patients in the intervention group were able to follow at least partially the exercise programme, although the performance among them was rather heterogeneous. There were no differences between groups regarding clinical outcomes or complications related to the exercises.","An early postoperative mobilization programme based on supervised exercises seems to be safe and feasible and improves functional capacity in patients undergoing major elective abdominal oncology surgery. However, its impact on clinical outcomes is still unclear."

1543,29546523,"Given the critical role of parental care for pediatric cancer patients, this pilot study evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a hospital-based solution-focused brief therapy (SFBT) intervention for reducing psychological distress among parents of pediatric cancer patients in China. Differences between treatment and active control (AC) groups were assessed on dimensions of psychological distress. Parents' level of hope was also assessed.","Participants (N\u2009=\u200944) were randomly assigned to SFBT or AC. Parents received four sessions of SFBT twice a week delivered by graduate-level hospital social workers. Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured change in distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) of parents as well as their level of hope.","Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated the SFBT group had better outcomes than the AC group on overall distress of somatic, anxiety, depression symptoms and level of hope. Within- and between-group treatment effects reported significantly greater effect of the SFBT group than of the AC group.","Considering the inherent limits of a pilot feasibility study, results suggest that SFBT is a feasible, culturally compatible, and promising intervention for alleviating distress among Chinese parents of children with cancer. Additional comprehensive trials are needed to draw more definitive conclusions.SFBT may be beneficial for improving the critical support systems of parents of pediatric cancer patients. Thus, SFBT may have the potential to enhance children's well-being during cancer treatment and recovery."
1544,29036016,The presence of bone metastases has excluded participation of cancer patients in exercise interventions and is a relative contraindication to supervised exercise in the community setting because of concerns of fragility fracture. We examined the efficacy and safety of a modular multimodal exercise program in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.,"Between 2012 and 2015, 57 prostate cancer patients (70.0 \u00b1 8.4 yr; body mass index, 28.7 \u00b1 4.0 kg\u00b7m) with bone metastases (pelvis, 75.4%; femur, 40.4%; rib/thoracic spine, 66.7%; lumbar spine, 43.9%; humerus, 24.6%; other sites, 70.2%) were randomized to multimodal supervised aerobic, resistance, and flexibility exercises undertaken thrice weekly (EX; n = 28) or usual care (CON; n = 29) for 3 months. Physical function subscale of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 was the primary end point as an indicator of patient-rated physical functioning. Secondary end points included objective measures of physical function, lower body muscle strength, body composition, and fatigue. Safety was assessed by recording the incidence and severity of any adverse events, skeletal complications, and bone pain throughout the intervention.","There was a significant difference between groups for self-reported physical functioning (3.2 points; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-6.0 points; P = 0.028) and lower body muscle strength (6.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-12.7; P = 0.033) at 3 months favoring EX. However, there was no difference between groups for lean mass (P = 0.584), fat mass (P = 0.598), or fatigue (P = 0.964). There were no exercise-related adverse events or skeletal fractures and no differences in bone pain between EX and CON (P = 0.507).",Multimodal modular exercise in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases led to self-reported improvements in physical function and objectively measured lower body muscle strength with no skeletal complications or increased bone pain.
1545,16924050,To identify familial characteristics that may have influenced the effectiveness of a parent-based intervention to reduce unsafe sun practices in children aged 9 to 12 years (fourth through sixth grades).,"Randomized control design with a 30-day follow-up.Participants were recruited from 2 distinct regions in the United States: southern Idaho and eastern Tennessee.Three hundred forty children were assigned to the experimental group in which the parents received the intervention materials. One hundred twenty-nine respondents were assigned to the control group.The intervention provided materials that encouraged parents to communicate skin cancer risks, promote sun-safe behaviors, and discourage high-risk sun-related behaviors.Outcome measures included sunburn frequencies, sunburn severity, and sunbathing tendencies. The moderator variables were positive characteristics of the parent-child relationship, levels of negative communication, parental monitoring, and child compliance.","Sunburn frequency, sunburn severity, and sunbathing tendencies were most effectively reduced when the quality of the parent-child relationship was high, the child exhibited high levels of compliance, and there were low levels of negative communication.",The findings of this study provide evidence that parents can be viable change agents for child behaviors and that the quality of the family relationship is critical to the success of such interventions.

The 12-month exercise intervention comprised weekly supervised step aerobic- and circuit-exercises and similar home training. Bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine and femoral neck were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Physical performance was assessed by 2-km walking and figure-8 running tests, and the amount of physical activity was estimated in metabolic equivalent-hours/week.","In premenopausal women, bone loss at the femoral neck was prevented by exercise, the mean BMD changes being -0.2% among the trainees vs. -1.4% among the controls (p\u2009=\u20090.01). Lumbar bone loss could not be prevented (-1.9% vs. -2.2%). In postmenopausal women, no significant exercise-effect on BMD was found either at the lumbar spine (-1.6% vs. -2.1%) or femoral neck (-1.1% vs. -1.1%).","This 12-month aerobic jumping and circuit training intervention completely prevented femoral neck bone loss in premenopausal breast cancer patients, whereas no effect on BMD was seen in postmenopausal women."
1548,29562927,"Physical activity has emerged as an important lifestyle factor for primary prevention of numerous diseases, including postmenopausal breast cancer. No study to date has assessed the acute and long-term effects of year-long aerobic exercise programs differing in prescribed exercise volume on physical activity and sedentary time in postmenopausal women. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of two moderate-vigorous intensity exercise doses on total, light and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity times, and sedentary time in postmenopausal women during the year-long intervention and one year later.","The Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA) was a two-center, two-arm, 12-month randomized controlled trial that included 400 previously inactive postmenopausal women randomized to either 150 (MODERATE) or 300 (HIGH) minutes/week of aerobic exercise. Physical activity and sedentary time were assessed at baseline, 6- (intervention mid-point), 12- (prior to end of intervention) and 24-months (follow-up) with waist-mounted accelerometers (Actigraph GTX3\u00ae). Self-reported activity and sedentary time at baseline, 12- and 24-months was also assessed (Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire and SIT-Q). Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using linear mixed models and adjusted for baseline variables.","Both physical activity interventions led to increases in objective and subjective measures of total and moderate-vigorous intensity/recreational physical activity time, coupled with decreases in sedentary time, at 6- and 12-months compared to baseline. Additionally, greater increases in accelerometry-derived total physical activity time at 6- and 12-months, and self-reported recreational activity time at 12-months, compared to baseline were noted in the HIGH versus MODERATE groups. Decreases in total, light and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity time, and an increase in sedentary time, in both groups were noted at 24-months compared to 12-months. A decrease in light intensity physical activity time in both groups at 24-months compared to baseline was also noted.","These findings have important health implications, suggesting that total physical activity time can be increased with greater volumes of prescribed exercise, but that additional support and resources could be used to promote the maintenance of these high levels of aerobic exercise participation following study completion."
1549,18048636,This study evaluates alternative protocols in telephone counselling for smoking cessation.,"The American Cancer Society enrolled 6322 clients in a randomised trial comparing three counselling formats of varying duration and frequency of contact, with or without booster sessions, and mailed self help booklets without telephone counselling.Participants were drawn from callers to the American Cancer Society's National Cancer Information Center seeking assistance with smoking cessation who provided informed consent and were adult daily smokers, ready to make a quit attempt within two weeks, and from states not served by an evidence based proactive telephone counselling programme.",Six-month cessation rates (30-day point prevalence) were measured in telephone interviews.There was a significant counselling effect. The overall cessation rates that were yielded by a brief protocol including booster sessions were equivalent to those obtained with the American Cancer Society's standard protocol with boosters.,"Based on these findings, the abbreviated protocol with five sessions and two boosters is considered to be an option for improving cost efficiency in the delivery of this service."
1550,15309460,"Excess adiposity has been shown to be associated with increased risk for breast cancer recurrence, and a plant-based eating pattern has been hypothesized to be protective. Whether a plant-based diet without specific energy goals will result in weight loss or changes in body composition in women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer has not been fully explored.This study was conducted to identify changes in body weight, anthropometric measures, and body composition over a four year period in a sub-sample of breast cancer survivors participating in a dietary intervention targeting increased intake of vegetables, fruit and fiber and decreased dietary fat intake.","This randomized, controlled dietary intervention study compared longitudinal changes in intakes, body weight, waist:hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) and body composition by treatment group among fifty-two women previously treated for Stage I, II, or IIIA breast cancer from the Arizona site of the Women's Healthy Eating and Living Study. The dietary intervention aimed for eight servings of fruit and vegetables, 30 g fiber, &lt; or = 20% total energy from fat per day, as well as daily intake of vegetable juice. The comparison group was advised to follow general dietary guidelines for cancer prevention.","The dietary intervention resulted in a significant and sustained increase in fiber, fruit, vegetable, and vegetable juice consumption (p &lt; 0.05) among intervention group subjects as compared to comparison group subjects. The first 6 months resulted in a reduction in body weight and body fat among the intervention group subjects while the comparison group subjects remained stable. Subsequent measurements, at 12, 24 or 36, and 48 months, showed no significant differences in mean body weight, BMI, WHR, or body composition by study group. Also, no significant changes in these measures were demonstrated for either study group between baseline and 48 months.","The dietary intervention efforts resulted in significant changes in diet toward an increase in plant foods and a decrease in dietary fat. Changes in weight, WHR, BMI, and body composition were not different over time or by study group assignment. Interventions that promote a plant-based diet without specific energy restriction do not appear to promote changes in body weight or body composition in women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. To adequately examine the role of energy restriction in reducing obesity-associated breast cancer recurrence, future interventions should include prescribed energy imbalance either through reduced intake and/or increased expenditure."
1551,18467066,"This article focuses on design, training, and delivery of motivational interview (MI) in a longitudinal randomized controlled trial intended to assess the efficacy of two separate interventions designed to increase colorectal screening when compared to a usual care, control group. One intervention was a single-session, telephone-based MI, created to increase colorectal cancer screening within primary care populations. The other was tailored health counseling. We present the rationale, design, and process discussions of the one-time motivational interviewing telephone intervention. We discuss in this paper the training and supervision of study interventionists, in order to enhance practice and research knowledge concerned with fidelity issues in motivational interview interventions.","To improve motivational interviewing proficiency and effectiveness, we developed a prescribed training program adapting MI to a telephone counseling session.","The three interventionists trained in MI demonstrate some MI proficiency assessed by the motivational interviewing treatment integrity scale. In the post-intervention interview, 20.5% of the MI participants reported having had a CRC screening test, and another 19.75% (n=16) had scheduled a screening test. Almost half of the participants (43%) indicated that the phone conversation helped them to overcome the reasons why they had not had a screening test.","Ongoing supervision and training (post-MI workshop) are crucial to supporting MI fidelity. The trajectory of learning MI demonstrated by the interventionists is consistent with the eight stages of learning MI. The MI road map created for the interventionists has shown to be more of a distraction than a facilitator in the delivery of the telephone intervention. MI can, however, be considered a useful tool for health education and warrants further study.MI training should include consistent training and process evaluation. MI can, however, be considered a useful tool for health education and warrants further study. MI can also be adapted to diverse health promotion scenarios."
1552,18602242,"To experimentally test whether using pictographs (image matrices), incremental risk formats, and varied risk denominators would influence perceptions and comprehension of side effect risks in an online decision aid about prophylactic use of tamoxifen to prevent primary breast cancers.","We recruited 631 women with elevated breast cancer risk from two healthcare organizations. Participants saw tailored estimates of the risks of 5 side effects: endometrial cancer, blood clotting, cataracts, hormonal symptoms, and sexual problems. Presentation format was randomly varied in a three factor design: (A) risk information was displayed either in pictographs or numeric text; (B) presentations either reported total risks with and without tamoxifen or highlighted the incremental risk most relevant for decision making; and (C) risk estimates used 100 or 1000 person denominators. Primary outcome measures included risk perceptions and gist knowledge.","Incremental risk formats consistently lowered perceived risk of side effects but resulted in low knowledge when displayed by numeric text only. Adding pictographs, however, produced significantly higher comprehension levels.","Pictographs make risk statistics easier to interpret, reducing biases associated with incremental risk presentations.Including graphs in risk communications is essential to support an informed treatment decision-making process."
1553,17179058,"Even when primary care physicians have face-to-face discussions with patients before referring them for screening colonoscopy, patient nonadherence can be substantial. Often, primary care physicians lack sufficient time to educate patients and address their potential misconceptions and fears about this procedure.To test whether an informational brochure sent to patients' home addresses after referral for screening colonoscopy would increase patient completion of the procedure.","Randomized, controlled trial.2 general internal medicine practices affiliated with the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.781 consecutive patients 50 years of age or older referred by their primary care physicians for screening colonoscopy.Patients were randomly assigned to receive usual care (control group) versus usual care plus an informational brochure (intervention group). The brochure was mailed within 10 days of referral for screening colonoscopy; it mentioned the name of the patient's primary care physician and encouraged patients to schedule a procedure. It also described colorectal cancer and polyps and the similar lifetime risks for colorectal cancer for men and women, colonoscopy and risk for perforation, the nature of bowel preparation for the procedure, and alternative screening tests.Rates of adherence to screening colonoscopy in the 2 study groups.","The overall adherence rate was 11.7 percentage points (95% CI, 5.1 to 18.4 percentage points) greater in the intervention group than in the control group (70.7% vs. 59.0%). Older patients were more adherent than younger patients. Patients with low-income insurance plans, such as Medicaid, were less adherent despite being sent a brochure.","The small number of clinical practices and minority patients may limit generalizability. In addition, it was not possible to determine the degree to which adherence was influenced by a reminder to schedule a procedure versus detailed information about colonoscopy.An inexpensive mailed brochure is an effective way to increase patient adherence to primary care physician referral for screening colonoscopy."

Serial serum levels of proinflammatory and neurotrophic cytokines were obtained at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 14.","Twenty-seven patients with MM were enrolled in the trial. There were no adverse events associated with the acupuncture treatments. TNSc data were deemed invalid and therefore were not reported. At weeks 10 and 14, FACT/GOG-Ntx and NPS showed significant reduction suggesting decreased pain, and improved function (P values were &lt;.0001 for both FACT/GOG-Ntx and NPS at weeks 10 and 14). However, nerve conduction studies did not significantly change between baseline assessment and end of study. There was no correlation in serum cytokines for responders versus none responders.","Acupuncture is safe, feasible and produces subjective improvements in patients' symptoms. A follow-up randomized controlled trial is warranted."

The structured information pack improved GP knowledge of oncology; GPs found themselves better equipped to support and counsel patients during the course of their illness, and practitioner satisfaction with the department rose.","Intervention, though reasonably simple, inexpensive and not particularly time-consuming, improved cooperation between the specialist department and the GP. While this is a small step in the right direction, the need remains for new initiatives and further studies into how to improve cooperation and communication between the primary and secondary healthcare sectors."
