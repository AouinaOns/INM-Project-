Exercise rehabilitation has potential to prevent or alleviate CIPN. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of muscle strengthening and balancing exercises on CIPN pain and quality of life (QOL) among cancer patients. The randomized controlled trial included 45 cancer patients from a tertiary care hospital in India receiving chemotherapeutic drugs paclitaxel and carboplatin and found to have CIPN. Subjects were randomly allocated to exercise (n1 = 22) and usual care (n2 = 23) groups. The exercise group received home-based muscle strengthening and balancing exercise for 10 weeks. Data regarding demographic, clinical characteristics, CIPN, neuropathic pain, and QOL were collected by structured questionnaires Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy Assessment Tool, nerve conduction velocity, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale, and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. The 2 groups were homogenous regarding demographic variables. In clinical characteristics, the exercise group had larger body surface area and received a higher dose of paclitaxel. Significant reduction in neuropathic pain scores (P < .0001) and improvement in Functional QOL (P = .0002), Symptom QOL (P = .0003), Global Health Status QOL (P = .004) scores were observed after intervention in the exercise group than the usual-care group. Muscle strengthening and balancing exercises are effective in reducing CIPN pain and improving QOL among cancer patients.

The increase in the incidence of breast cancer is partly accounted for by increases in life expectancy due to improvements in public health, but also related to an increase in risk factors for cancer including smoking, excess body weight, decreased physical activity, and changes in reproductive activity. Health-promoting lifestyle is therefore one of the major topics of importance in studying chronic illnesses and cancer. Health promotion interventions, including the use of care models, have a vast contribution to make in terms of timely diagnosis and improved survival. One such care model, which has been designed to increase self-care, adherence, and performance in chronic patients, is the continuous care model (CCM). This study was conducted with the purpose of determining the influence of the CCM on the health-promoting lifestyle of patients with breast cancer during 2017-2018. In this randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with breast cancer were chosen by convenience sampling followed by random allocation into treatment and control groups. Six sessions of group discussion were held for the treatment group according to the CCM and items in the health-promoting lifestyle questionnaire. Data collection tools included a general health questionnaire, a demographic questionnaire, a family support questionnaire, and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP), which respondents completed before and after the intervention. P values \u2264 .05 were considered significant. When comparing the mean score of health-promoting lifestyle in both the control and treatment groups, before and after the intervention, significant increases in every dimension were observed. The average overall health promotion lifestyle was revealed to be significantly elevated from 123.48 to 147.12. However, in the control group the mean scores had slightly increased or were the same in all the dimensions. In addition, the average overall health promotion lifestyle had increased from 119.89 to 121.32. The observed difference in mean scores was not statistically significant. The CCM increased the score of health-promoting lifestyle of patients with breast cancer. Therefore, this caring model can be considered an alternative to improve healthy lifestyles of patients with cancer.", "stype": ["Randomized Controlled Trial", "Trial"], "doi": "10.1097/HNP.0000000000000392", "url": ""}, "32247251": {"researchdesign": "Interventional", "title": "Reduced symptom burden with the support of an interactive app during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer - A randomized controlled trial", "pubdate": "2020-06-01", "npi": ["mobile applications"], "fullabstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy causes distressing symptoms, which have to be managed by patients at home.

Results: At 6 months postintervention, the IG showed significant improvements versus CG in physical functioning (p = .027), role functioning (p = .028), and Mediterranean diet adherence (p = .02) and a significant reduction in body mass index (p = .04) and weight (p = .05), with a mean weight loss of 0.7 kg versus a gain of 0.55 kg by the CG (p = .05). Dyspnea symptoms were also increased in the CG versus IG (p = .066). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that an integrative dietary, physical activity, and mindfulness program enhances the QoL and healthy lifestyle of stage IIA-IIB breast cancer survivors.

Multimodal prehabilitation was a preoperative conditioning intervention including aerobic and resistance exercise, diet therapy, and relaxation techniques. Primary outcome was perioperative change in functional capacity, measured with the distance covered during a 6-min walk test (6MWD), assessed at baseline, before surgery, and at 4 and 8 wk after surgery. Data were compared using robust mixed linear models for repeated measures. Preoperative change in 6MWD compared with baseline was not significantly different between groups (prehab group 40.8 [114.0] m vs control group 9.7 (108.4) m, p=0.250). However, at 4 wk after surgery, a significant difference in functional capacity was detected (6MWD, prehab group -15.4 [142.5] m vs control group -97.9 [123.8] m, p=0.014). No intervention-related adverse effects were reported. Data suggested that multimodal prehabilitation resulted in faster functional recovery after radical cystectomy.

Resting skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained pre- and postintervention from 23 randomly selected women from the OptiTrain breast cancer trial who underwent RT-HIIT, AT-HIIT, or UC for 16 wk. Over the intervention, citrate synthase activity, muscle fiber cross-sectional area, capillaries per fiber, and myosin heavy chain isoform type I were reduced in UC, whereas RT-HIIT and AT-HIIT were able to counteract these declines. AT-HIIT promoted up-regulation of the electron transport chain protein levels vs. UC. RT-HIIT favored satellite cell count vs. UC and AT-HIIT. There was a significant association between change in citrate synthase activity and self-reported fatigue. AT-HIIT and RT-HIIT maintained or improved markers of skeletal muscle function compared with the declines found in the UC group, indicating a sustained trainability in addition to the preservation of skeletal muscle structural and metabolic characteristics during chemotherapy.

In both studies, PC-18 was not superior to placebo as assessed by both Chalder and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) fatigue questionnaires, probably reflecting unexpectedly good placebo antifatigue activity. Since all capsules employed in both studies contained about 100 mg of magnesium silicate as an excipient, we retrospectively evaluated frozen serum samples from the second study and found a significant increase in magnesium levels after patients received placebo. By multivariate analysis, higher prerandomization magnesium levels and higher BFI scores together with the use of a 12.5 mg dose of PC-18 all correlated significantly with higher posttreatment BFI scores.

BRECONDA resulted in significantly less decisional conflict and greater satisfaction with information over time. Quality-adjusted life years did not differ between participants who received the decision aid compared with usual care. The cost of BRECONDA was estimated to be small (AUD$10) relative to other health care interventions and resulted in decreased health care costs overall (AUD$764).

The Breast Cancer and Exercise Trial in Alberta (BETA) was a two-center, two-arm, 12-month randomized controlled trial that included 400 previously inactive postmenopausal women randomized to either 150 (MODERATE) or 300 (HIGH) minutes/week of aerobic exercise.

Self-reported activity and sedentary time at baseline, 12- and 24-months was also assessed (Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire and SIT-Q). Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using linear mixed models and adjusted for baseline variables. Both physical activity interventions led to increases in objective and subjective measures of total and moderate-vigorous intensity/recreational physical activity time, coupled with decreases in sedentary time, at 6- and 12-months compared to baseline. Additionally, greater increases in accelerometry-derived total physical activity time at 6- and 12-months, and self-reported recreational activity time at 12-months, compared to baseline were noted in the HIGH versus MODERATE groups. Decreases in total, light and moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity time, and an increase in sedentary time, in both groups were noted at 24-months compared to 12-months. A decrease in light intensity physical activity time in both groups at 24-months compared to baseline was also noted.

For the experimental group, auricular acupressure was applied to seven auricular acupoints for 6 weeks using vaccaria seeds, whereas the control group received the usual care. Constipation-assessment scores of the experimental group were significantly lower compared with the control group ( p < .001). Stool-form scores of the experimental group were significantly higher compared with the control group ( p = .003). Patient Assessment of Constipation-Quality of Life scores of the experimental group were significantly lower compared with the control group ( p < .001). Auricular acupressure was effective at relieving constipation in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Auricular acupressure was also a safe and acceptable nursing intervention.", "stype": ["Randomized Controlled Trial"], "doi": "10.1177/0193945916680362", "url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0193945916680362"}}
