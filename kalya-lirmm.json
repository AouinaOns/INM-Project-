Patient-caregiver dyads (N = 256) were randomized to 4 weekly reflexology sessions or attention control. Caregivers in the intervention group were trained by a reflexology practitioner in a 30-min protocol. During the 4 weeks, both groups completed telephone symptom assessments using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory. Those who completed at least one weekly call were included in this secondary analysis (N = 209). Each symptom was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe using established interference-based cut-points. Symptom response meant an improvement by at least one category or remaining mild. Symptom responses were treated as multiple events within patients and analyzed using generalized estimating equations technique. Reflexology was more successful than attention control in producing responses for pain (OR = 1.84, 95% CI (1.05, 3.23), p = 0.03), with no significant differences for other symptoms. In the reflexology group, greater probability of response across all symptoms was associated with lower number of comorbid condition and lower depressive symptomatology at baseline. Compared to odds of responses on pain (chosen as a referent symptom), greater odds of symptom response were found for disturbed sleep and difficulty remembering with older aged participants. Home-based caregiver-delivered reflexology was helpful in decreasing patient-reported pain. Age, comorbid conditions, and depression are potentially important tailoring factors for future research and can be used to identify patients who may benefit from reflexology.

Informal caregiving can negatively affect the health and well-being of caregivers. We need a synthesised account of best evidence to aid decision-making about effective ways to support caregivers for individuals 'living with cancer'. To assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions designed to improve the quality of life (QoL), physical health and well-being of informal caregivers of people living with cancer compared with usual care. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ProQuest, Open SIGLE, Web of Science from inception up to January 2018, trial registries and citation lists of included studies. We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing psychosocial interventions delivered to adult informal caregivers of adults affected by cancer on a group or individual basis with usual care. Psychosocial interventions included non-pharmacological interventions that involved an interpersonal relationship between caregivers and healthcare professionals. We included interventions delivered also to caregiver-patient dyads. Interventions delivered to caregivers of individuals receiving palliative or inpatient care were excluded. Our primary outcome was caregiver QoL. Secondary outcomes included patient QoL, caregiver and patient depression, anxiety, psychological distress, physical health status and intervention satisfaction and adverse effects. Pairs of review authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessments. We synthesised findings using meta-analysis, where possible, and reported remaining results in a narrative synthesis. Nineteen trials (n = 3, 725) were included in the review. All trials were reported in English and were undertaken in high-income countries. Trials targeted caregivers of patients affected by a number of cancers spanning newly diagnosed patients, patients awaiting treatment, patients who were being treated currently and individuals post-treatment. Most trials delivered interventions to caregiver-patient dyads (predominantly spousal dyads) and there was variation in intervention delivery to groups or individual participants. There was much heterogeneity across interventions though the majority were defined as psycho-educational. All trials were rated as being at 'high risk of bias'.Compared to usual care, psychosocial interventions may improve slightly caregiver QoL immediately post intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.53; studies = 2, 265 participants) and may have little to no effect on caregiver QoL at 12 months (SMD 0.14, 95% CI - 0.11 to 0.40; studies = 2, 239 participants) post-intervention (both low-quality evidence).Psychosocial interventions probably have little to no effect on caregiver depression immediately to one-month post-intervention (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.15; studies = 9, 702 participants) (moderate-quality evidence).

There was uncertainty whether psychosocial interventions improve patient QoL immediately (SMD -0.03, 95 %CI -0.50 to 0.44; studies = 2, 292 participants) or caregiver anxiety three-to-six months (SMD-0.25, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.13; studies = 4, 272 participants) post-intervention (both very low-quality evidence).

This is a national cluster-randomized trial (C-RCT) in 12 Norwegian hospitals. The trial investigates effects of early, systematic integration of oncology and specialized PC in patients with advanced cancer in six intervention hospitals compared with conventional care in six. Hospitals are stratified on the size of local catchment areas before randomization. In the intervention hospitals, a three-part complex intervention will be implemented. The backbone of the intervention is the development and implementation of patient-centered care pathways that contain early, compulsory referral to PC and regular and systematic registrations of symptoms. An educational program must be completed before patient inclusion. A total of 680 patients with advanced cancer and one caregiver per patient are included when patients come for start of last line of chemotherapy, defined according to national treatment guidelines. Data registration, clinical variables, and patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes take place every 2 months for 1 year or until death. The primary outcome is use of chemotherapy in the last 3 months of life by comparing the proportion of patients who receive this in the intervention and control groups. Primary outcome is use of chemotherapy in the last 3 months before death, i.e. number of patients. Secondary outcomes are initiation, discontinuation and number of cycles, last 3 months of life, administration of other medical interventions in the last month of life, symptom burden, quality of life (QoL), satisfaction with information and follow-up, and caregiver health, QoL, and satisfaction with care. Results from this C-RCT will be used to raise the awareness about the positive outcomes of early provision of specialized palliative care using pathways for patients with advanced cancer receiving medical anticancer treatment. The long-term clinical objective is to integrate these patient-centered pathways in Norwegian cancer care. The specific focus on the patient and family and the organization of a predictable care trajectory is consistent with current Norwegian strategies for cancer care. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03088202.

This multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted at 3 hospitals in Tanzania. Eligible participants were aged between 25 and 60 years, had tested positive to a rapid HPV test during a patient-initiated screening, had been informed of their HPV result, and had a private mobile phone with a valid number. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control group through an incorporated algorithm in the text message system. The intervention group received one-way text messages, and the control group received no text messages. The primary outcome was attendance at a 14-month health provider-initiated follow-up screening. Participants were not blinded, but outcome assessors were. The analysis was based on intention to treat. Between August 2015 and July 2017, 4080 women were screened for cervical cancer, of which 705 were included in this trial-358 women were allocated to the intervention group, and 347 women were allocated to the control group. Moreover, 16 women were excluded before the analysis because they developed cervical cancer or died (8 from each group).

The purpose of this study was to explore the participants' perceptions of the relevance and benefits of an internet-based stepped care program (iCAN-DO) targeting individuals with cancer and concurrent symptoms of anxiety and depression. We performed a qualitative study with an inductive approach, in which we used semistructured questions to interview 15 individuals using iCAN-DO. We analyzed the interviews using content analysis. The analysis found 17 subcategories regarding the stepped care intervention, resulting in 4 categories. Participants described the need for information as large and looked upon finding information almost as a survival strategy when receiving the cancer diagnosis. iCAN-DO was seen as a useful, reliable source of information and support. It was used as a complement to standard care and as a means to inform next of kin. Increased knowledge was a foundation for continued processing of participants' own feelings. The optimal time to gain access to iCAN-DO would have been when being informed of the diagnosis. The most common denominator was feeling acknowledged and supported, but with a desire for further adaptation of the system to each individual's own situation and needs.

The Adapted Physical Activity and Cardiac Coherence in Hematologic Patients (APACCHE) protocol is a randomized, controlled superiority trial designed to evaluate the effects of HRBV training combined with an adaptive physical activity (APA) program compared to APA alone on the post-treatment quality of life of adult hematologic patients. Seventy patients aged 18-70 years, with various forms of hematological malignancies, in post-treatment remission within six months prior to beginning the study and who have been prescribed APA by a hematologist, will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to two 12-week treatment groups: HRVB + APA versus APA alone. APA sessions will consist of aerobic and resistance training for 1-h twice weekly. The HRVB training will consist of controlled breathing exercises with biofeedback of heart rate variability for 10 sessions and will include a daily home-based practice.

We also digitalized a standard educational pamphlet from the National Cancer Institute (NCI Education). Both were tailored to reduce cognitive load during use. We conducted a randomized trial of Let's Talk About Smoking versus NCI Education to test whether the interactive motivational intervention was more effective and more appealing than the static educational intervention for increasing use of smoking cessation treatment, quit attempts, and abstinence among smokers with schizophrenia, accounting for the level of cognitive functioning. Adult smokers with schizophrenia (n=162) were enrolled in the study from 2014 to 2015, randomly assigned to intervention condition, and assessed in person at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Interventions were delivered on a laptop computer in a single session. All participants had access to standard, community-delivered cessation treatments during follow-up. Multivariate models were used to evaluate outcomes. Treatment initiation outcomes were not different between intervention conditions (27/84 [32%] for Let's Talk About Smoking vs 36/78 [46%] for NCI Education; odds ratio [OR] 0.71 [95% CI 0.37-1.33]); 38.9% (63/162) of participants initiated treatment. Older age (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.00-1.07]; P=.05), higher education (OR 1.21 [95% CI 1.04-1.41]; P=.03), and fewer positive symptoms (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.80-0.96]; P=.01) predicted cessation treatment initiation, whereas level of cognition did not. The mean satisfaction and usability index score was higher for Let's Talk About Smoking versus NCI Education (8.9 [SD 1.3] vs 8.3 [SD 2.1]; t The interactive, multimedia intervention was not more effective than the static, text-based intervention among smokers with schizophrenia. Both tailored digital interventions resulted in levels of treatment engagement and quit attempts that were similar to findings from previous studies of in-person interventions, confirming the potential role of digital interventions to educate and motivate smokers with schizophrenia to use cessation treatment and to quit smoking. These findings indicate that additional cessation treatment is needed after brief education or motivational interventions, and that cessation treatment should be adjusted for people with cognitive impairment.

This makes the promotion of healthy dietary and PA behaviors a public health priority. This paper describes the development, design, and evaluation protocol of a Web-based computer-tailored (CT) dietary and PA promotion intervention, MyLifestyleCoach. A Web-based format was chosen for its accessibility and large-scale reach and low-cost potential. To achieve effective and persistent behavioral change, this innovative intervention is tailored to individual characteristics and is based on the self-determination theory and motivational interviewing (MI). The 6 steps of the intervention mapping protocol were used to systematically develop MyLifestyleCoach based on the existing effective CT PA promotion intervention I Move. The MyLifestyleCoach intervention consists of 2 modules: I Move, which is aimed at promoting PA, and I Eat, which is aimed at promoting healthy eating. Development of the I Eat module was informed by the previously developed I Move. Both modules were integrated to form the comprehensive MyLifestyleCoach program. Furthermore, I Move was slightly adapted, for example, the new Dutch PA guidelines were implemented. A randomized controlled trial consisting of an intervention condition and waiting list control group will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on diet and PA. Self-reported measures take place at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline. Enrollment started in October 2018 and will be completed in June 2020. Data analysis is currently under way, and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2020. MyLifestyleCoach is one of the first interventions to translate and apply self-determination theory and techniques from MI in Web-based computer tailoring for an intervention targeting PA and dietary behavior. Intervention mapping served as a blueprint for the development of this intervention. We will evaluate whether this approach is also successful in promoting eating healthier and increasing PA using an randomized controlled trial by comparing the intervention to a waiting list control condition. The results will provide an insight into the short- and long-term efficacy and will result in recommendations for the implementation and promotion of healthy eating and PA among adults in the Netherlands.

The participants will be allocated to either the intervention arm (Pilates solo or belly dance classes three times per week for 16 weeks) or a control group (receipt of a booklet on physical activity for patients with breast cancer and maintenance of habitual physical activity routine). The Pilates solo and belly dance classes will be divided into three stages: warmup and stretching, the main stage, and relaxation. Measurements of the study outcomes will take place at baseline; postintervention; and 6, 12, and 24 months after the end of the intervention (maintenance period). The data collection for both groups will occur with a paper questionnaire and tests covering general and clinical information. The primary outcome will be quality of life (EORT QLQ-C30 and EORT QLQ-BR23), and secondary outcomes will be physical aspects such as cardiorespiratory fitness (6-min walk test and cycle ergometer), lymphedema (sum of arm circumference), physical activity (IPAQ short version), disabilities of the arm (DASH), range of motion (goniometer test), muscular strength (dynamometer test) and flexibility (sit and reach test), and psychological aspects such as depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory), body image (Body Image After Breast Cancer Questionnaire), self-esteem (Rosenberg), fatigue (FACT-F), pain (VAS), sexual function (FSFI), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). In view of the high prevalence of breast cancer among women, the implementation of a specific protocol of Pilates solo and belly dancing for patients with breast cancer is important, considering the necessity to improve their physical and psychological quality of life. Pilates solo and belly dancing are two types of physical activity that involve mental and physical concentration, music, upper limb movements, femininity, and social involvement. An intervention with these two physical activities could offer options of supportive care to women with breast cancer undergoing treatment, with the aim being to improve physical and psychological quality of life.

Yet, few researchers have explored the effects of physical activity on physical and psychological outcomes among AYA cancer survivors. A pilot study exploring the feasibility and acceptability of a physical activity intervention and proposed trial methods to inform a definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) is therefore necessary to fill this gap. A two-arm, mixed-methods pilot RCT was conducted. Participants were randomized to a wait-list control group or a 12-week physical activity intervention comprised of 4 weekly aerobic and strength training sessions (intervention group). Feasibility measures included: number of AYA cancer survivors referred/self-referred, eligible, and recruited, retention to the trial (i.e. assessment completion), adherence to the physical activity intervention, and percentage of missing data for baseline (week 0), mid- (week 6), and post-intervention assessments (week 12). The acceptability of trial methods (all participants) and the intervention (intervention group only) was assessed via qualitative interviews post-intervention. Over a 12-month period, 31 AYA cancer survivors were referred/self-referred and 16 were eligible and consented to participate. Retention to the trial was 94% and adherence to the physical activity intervention ranged from 50 to 92%. With the exception of the assessment of aerobic capacity and directly measured physical activity behaviour, there were no missing data. Participants generally reported being satisfied with the trial methods and intervention; however, issues related to delivery of the physical activity intervention were identified. The methods and intervention piloted require modification and further pilot testing in advance of a definitive RCT. Recruitment strategies identifying a greater number of younger AYA cancer survivors who have different types of cancers and who lack motivation to participate in physical activity-based studies should be explored. Refining the assessments of directly measured physical activity behaviour and aerobic capacity and incorporating behavioural support into the intervention may improve feasibility and acceptability. This study highlights the value of doing pilot work and provides critically useful data that can be used to refine studies seeking to assess causation and optimize physical activity interventions for AYA cancer survivors. clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03016728.

We will enroll at least 3360 participants older than 18 years. The enrolled participants will be randomly divided into two groups (1:1 ratio). The intervention group will be offered a 7-day mobile health education, and participants in both groups will fill out 4 questionnaires at the baseline, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the intervention. The primary outcome is the difference in HPV vaccination or reservation for the HPV vaccine between the intervention and control groups. Secondary outcomes will include the comparison of (1) knowledge, attitudes, motivation, beliefs and behavioral skill about HPV and cervical cancer prevention, and (2) the willingness to uptake HPV vaccination. This study will examine the theory-based intervention in improving HPV vaccination among Chinese female college students. We will conduct the randomized controlled trial to provide scientific evidence on the potential effect of the IMB theory-based intervention.

Recruitment began in May 2015, the first participant was randomised in June 2015, and the last participant was included in February 2017. In total, 214 men with prostate cancer were randomly assigned to either 6 months of free-of-charge football training twice weekly at a local club (football group [FG]) (n = 109) or usual care (usual care group [UG]) (n = 105), including brief information on physical activity recommendations at randomisation. Participants were on average 68.4 (SD 6.2) years old, 157 (73%) were retired, 87 (41%) were on castration-based treatment, 19 (9%) had received chemotherapy, and 41 (19%) had skeletal metastases at baseline. In this 1-year follow-up study, we evaluated the effects of community-based football training on the following outcomes: primary outcome, quality of life; secondary outcomes: continuation of football after 6 months, hip and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD), mental health score, fat and lean body mass, and safety outcomes, i.e., fractures, falls, and hospital admissions. Intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were conducted. No statistically significant between-group difference was observed in change in prostate-cancer-specific quality of life (ITT: 1.9 points [95% CI -1.9 to 5.8], p = 0.325; PP: 3.6 points [95% CI -0.9 to 8.2], p = 0.119).

There were no differences between groups in relation to fractures or falls. Hospital admissions were more frequent in UG compared to FG (33 versus 20; the odds ratio based on PP analysis was 0.34 for FG compared to UG). There were 3 deaths in FG and 4 in UG. Main limitations of the study were the physically active control group and assessment of physical activity by means of self-report. In this trial, participants allocated to football appeared to have improved hip BMD and fewer hospital admissions. Men who played football more than once a week for 1 year lost fat mass and reported improved mental health.

The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a family-based, multimedia intervention to augment the knowledge of CRC prevention among older South Asian adults in Hong Kong and enhance their motivation for undergoing FOBT. The acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. A cluster randomized controlled trial will be carried out. Three hundred and twenty South Asian dyads, comprising an older adult aged between 50 and 75 and a younger family member aged between 18 and 49, will be recruited in ten districts in Hong Kong through community organizations that provide support services for South Asians in local communities. Dyads will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or wait-list control group. Intervention dyads will receive intervention, whose contents are based on the health belief model, via multiple forms of media including PowerPoint presentation, video clip and health information booklet. Control dyads will receive intervention after post-intervention data are collected. For dyads in both groups, an appointment with a family doctor will be arranged for those willing to undergo FOBT. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Data will be analysed using the Generalised Linear Models Procedure in an intention-to-treat manner. Findings of this study will provide evidence of the benefits of utilizing multimedia and family-based approaches in intervention development to enhance the effectiveness of health promotion interventions for ethnic minorities. Further, the findings would provide reference to the potential incorporation of the intervention in the existing support services for South Asian ethnic minorities in local communities.

This study was a pre-planned secondary analysis of a larger randomized controlled trial of home-based exercise prehabilitation versus control for men undergoing radical prostatectomy. Twenty-one participants in both the prehabilitation and control groups wore accelerometers from postoperative day 1 until 7 days after discharge. Mean physical activity (minutes) during postoperative day 1 (inpatient) and 1 week following hospital discharge (outpatient) were estimated using ANCOVA. Pearson's correlation coefficients were conducted for mean in- an outpatient physical activity with length of stay and changes in 6-min walk test (6MWT) over the course of the prehabilitation period. Nineteen participants in each group provided usable accelerometry data for analysis. Inpatient physical activity of light or greater activity during postoperative day 1 for prehabilitation and control groups were 442.5 \u00b1 40.2 and 324.0 \u00b1 40.2 min, respectively (\u2206 = 117.5 \u00b1 57.8 min, 95%CI [0.04, 235.0]).

SRs of randomized or non-randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of rehabilitation interventions in women following BC treatment. All outcomes were considered. Methodological quality was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool and interrater agreement was evaluated. Out of 1269 citations retrieved, 37 SRs were included. Five rehabilitation areas were identified: exercise and physical activity (PA), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), yoga, lymphoedema treatment, and psychosocial interventions. The most solid evidence was found in exercise/PA and yoga. Exercise interventions improved outcomes such as shoulder mobility, lymphoedema, pain, fatigue and quality of life (QoL). Effects of yoga were shown on QoL, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms. The effect of CAM was shown on nausea, pain, fatigue, anger and anxiety but these results need to be interpreted with caution because of low methodological quality in included studies in the SRs. Among the lymphoedema treatments, positive effects were seen for resistance training on volume reduction and muscle strength and psychosocial interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy had positive effects on QoL, anxiety, depression and mood disturbance. This SR of SRs show solid positive effects of exercise/PA and yoga for women following BC treatment, and provides extended knowledge of the effects of CAM, yoga, lymphoedema treatment and psychosocial interventions. It is evident that more than one intervention could have positive effects on a specific symptom and that the effects depend not only on intervention type but also on how and when the intervention is provided. The results can be used as a foundation for individualized rehabilitation and aid health care professionals in meeting patients' individual needs and preferences.

Ninety-two patients with localized breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy were randomly assigned to an 18-week supervised moderate-to-high intensity aerobic and resistance exercise program, including two 1-hour sessions/week. Additionally, participants were asked to be physically active for at least 30 minutes/day on at least three other days. We report median percentages for attendance, compliance with the prescribed duration and intensity of aerobic and muscle strength exercises, and the exercise advice given. Predictors included in univariate and multivariable linear regression models were demographical, tumor- and treatment-related factors, constructs of the theory of planned behavior, psychological and physical factors. Patients attended 83% (interquartile range: 69-91%) of the supervised sessions. Compliance with the duration of aerobic exercise, high-intensity aerobic exercise (cycling at the ventilatory threshold), muscle strength exercises and the exercise advice were 88%(64-97%), 50%(22-82%), 84%(65-94%) and 61%(33%-79%), respectively. Education, radiotherapy, BMI and physical fatigue were important predictors of adherence to supervised exercise. Beliefs about planned behaviors were important predictors, especially for compliance with the exercise advice. Attendance to and compliance with an 18-week aerobic and strength exercise program were high. The lowest compliance was found for high-intensity supervised aerobic exercise. The identified predictors should be considered when designing or adapting exercise programs for patients with localized breast cancer to increase adherence.

The objective of our study was to describe caregiver perceptions of the usability and acceptability, and their suggestions for future adaptations, of a mobilized psychoeducation and skills-based intervention. This study was a part of a larger trial of a mobilized psychoeducation and skills-based intervention (Psychoeducation and Skills-Based Mobilized Intervention [Pep-Pal]) for caregivers of patients with advanced illness. This substudy used a mixed-methods analysis of quantitative data from all 26 intervention participants and qualitative data from 14 intervention caregivers who completed the Pep-Pal intervention. The qualitative semistructured individual interviews, which we conducted within the first 4 weeks after participants completed the intervention, assessed the acceptability and usability of Pep-Pal. Additionally, the qualitative interviews provided contextual evidence of how the intervention was helpful to interviewees in unanticipated ways. We conducted applied thematic analysis via independent review of transcripts to extract salient themes. Overall, caregivers of patients with advanced cancer deemed Pep-Pal to be acceptable in all Web-based sessions except for Improving Intimacy. Caregivers perceived the program to be of use across the areas they needed and in others that they had not anticipated. Caregiver recommendations of key changes for the program were to include more variety in caregiver actors in sessions, change the title of Improving Intimacy to Improving Relationships, provide an audio-only option in addition to video, and change the format of the mobilized website program to a stand-alone mobile app. The valuable feedback in key areas from individual interviews will be integrated into the final version of Pep-Pal that will be tested in a fully powered randomized clinical trial.

This study was performed in a public cantonal hospital in Switzerland with accreditation for colon and rectum cancer surgery. Patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were included. Patients were randomly assigned either to the intervention group receiving coffee or the control group receiving tea.

Secondary end points included the use of laxative, insertion of a nasogastric tube, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications. A total of 115 patients were randomly assigned: 56 were allocated to the coffee group and 59 to the tea group. After coffee intake, the first bowel movement occurred after a median of 65.2 hours versus 74.1 hours in the control group (intention-to-treat analysis; p = 0.008).

DT could be led by nurses or chaplains, the 2 disciplines within palliative care that may be most available to provide this intervention; however, it remains unclear how best it can work in real-life settings. We propose a randomized clinical trial whose aims are to (1) compare groups receiving usual palliative care for elderly patients with cancer or usual palliative care with DT for effects on (a) patient outcomes (dignity impact, existential tasks, and cancer prognosis awareness); and (b) processes of delivering palliative spiritual care services (satisfaction and unmet spiritual needs); and (2) explore the influence of physical symptoms and spiritual distress on the outcome effects (dignity impact and existential tasks) of usual palliative care and nurse- or chaplain-led DT. We hypothesize that, controlling for pretest scores, each of the DT groups will have higher scores on the dignity impact and existential task measures than the usual care group; each of the DT groups will have better peaceful awareness and treatment preference more consistent with their cancer prognosis than the usual care group. We also hypothesize that physical symptoms and spiritual distress will significantly affect intervention effects. We are conducting a 3-arm, pre- and posttest, randomized, controlled 4-step, stepped-wedge design to compare the effects of usual outpatient palliative care and usual outpatient palliative care along with either nurse- or chaplain-led DT on patient outcomes (dignity impact, existential tasks, and cancer prognosis awareness). We will include 560 elderly patients with cancer from 6 outpatient palliative care services across the United States. Using multilevel analysis with site, provider (nurse, chaplain), and time (step) included in the model, we will compare usual care and DT groups for effects on patient outcomes and spiritual care processes and determine the moderating effects of physical symptoms and spiritual distress. The funding was obtained in 2016, with participant enrollment starting in 2017. Results are expected in 2021.

However, there is no evidence of the effect on colonoscopy uptake of providing individuals with personalised risk information following a positive FIT test. The objectives of the study are: 1) To develop novel methods of presenting personalised risk information in an easy-to-understand format using infographics with involvement of members of the public 2) To assess the impact of different presentations of risk information on informed choice and intention to take up an offer of colonoscopy after FIT 3) To assess participants' responses to receiving personal risk information (knowledge, attitudes to screening/risk, emotional responses including anxiety). Adults (age range 50-74) registered on the Scottish Bowel Screening database will be invited by letter to take part. Consenting participants will be randomised to one of three groups to receive hypothetical information about their risk of cancer, based on age, gender and faecal haemoglobin concentration: 1) personalised risk information in numeric form (e.g. 1 in 100) with use of infographics, 2) personalised information described as 'highest', 'moderate' or 'lowest' risk with use of infographics, and 3) as a 'positive' test result, as is current practice. Groups will be compared on informed choice, intention to have a colonoscopy, and satisfaction with their decision. Follow-up semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted, by telephone, with a small number of consenting participants (n = 10 per group) to explore the acceptability/readability and any potential negative impact of the risk information, participants' understanding of risk factors, attitudes to the different scenarios, and reasons for reported intentions. Proving personalised risk information and allowing patient choice could lead to improved detection of CRC and increase patient satisfaction by facilitating informed choice over when/whether to undergo further invasive screening.

This study assessed how 6 weeks of exercise during chemotherapy affected relationships between changes in concentrations of several cytokines. This is a secondary analysis of a randomized trial studying 6 weeks of moderate-intensity walking and resistance exercise during chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. At pre- and post-intervention, patients provided blood to assess serum concentrations of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3, and receptor sTNFR1. We investigated relationships between cytokines using the correlations between changes in cytokine concentrations from pre- to post-intervention. We obtained complete data from 293 patients (149 randomized to exercise). Exercise strengthened the correlation between concentration changes of IL-10 and IL-6 (r = 0.44 in exercisers vs. 0.11 in controls; p = 0.001). We observed the same pattern for IL-10:IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10:sTNFR1.

Results Participants were diagnosed with breast (61%), gynaecological cancer (35%), or other type of cancer (4%). RTW rates were 84% and 90% for intervention versus control group. They were high compared to national register-based studies. No differences between groups were found on any of the outcomes. Receiving chemotherapy (HR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.59-3.73 p < 0.001), low level of education (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.076-2.52 p = 0.02) and low work ability (HR = 1.09 [95% CI 1.04-1.17] p = 0.02) were associated with longer time to full RTW. Conclusions We found high RTW rates compared to national register-based studies and we found no differences between groups. Future studies should therefore focus on reaching the group at risk, which consist of patients who receive chemotherapy, have a low level of education and have a low work ability at diagnosis.

This protocol illustrates a clinical trial designed to evaluate the usability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LuCApp versus standard of care. This is a 24-week two-arm non-blinded multicentre parallel randomised controlled trial. A total of 120 adult patients diagnosed with small or non-small cell lung cancer and eligible for pharmaceutical treatments will be allocated 1:1 to receiving either standard care or LuCApp in addition to standard care at three oncology sites in Northern Italy. During the treatment period, LuCApp allows daily monitoring and grading of a list of symptoms, which trigger alerts to the physicians in case predefined severity thresholds are met. Patients will complete a baseline assessment and a set of valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures every 3\u00b11 weeks, and up to 24 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the score of the Trial Outcome Index in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (Lung) questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes are the Lung Cancer Subscale, the EuroQoL 5D-5L questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form, the app usability questionnaire and the Zarit Burden Interview for the main caregiver. The trial received ethical approval from the three clinical sites. Trial results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Outcomes included behavioural, health-related, clinical, health service, or financial measures. Sixteen randomized controlled trials representing 2684 participants were included. Most studies were web-based interventions (n=9) and had a 12-week follow-up duration (n=8). Seven studies assessed dietary behaviour, of which two reported a significant benefit on diet quality or fruit and vegetable intake. Fifteen studies measured physical activity behaviour, of which eight studies reported a significant improvement in muscle strength and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Four of the nine studies assessing the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) reported a significant improvement in global HRQoL or a domain subscale.

Recruitment and retention difficulties suggest that the perihospitalization period may be a less than ideal time for delivering a smoking cessation app intervention. Framing of the app as a \"game\" may have decreased receptivity as participants may have been preoccupied with hospitalization demands and illness concerns.

The early identification and management of treatment-related symptoms are critical to prevent symptom distress due to unmanaged symptoms. However, the early identification and management of treatment-related symptoms are complex as most cancer treatments are delivered on an outpatient basis where patients are granted less face-to-face time with clinicians. The Electronic Symptom Assessment and Self-Care (ESRA-C) promotes participant self-management of treatment-related symptoms by providing participants with communication coaching and symptom self-report, education, and tracking features. While the ESRA-C intervention has been demonstrated to improve symptom distress significantly, little is known as to how the ESRA-C influenced participants' self-management practices and adherence to clinician recommendations for symptom/quality of life issues (SQIs). To compare participant adherence to clinician recommendations and additional self-management strategy use for SQIs between ESRA-C intervention and control (electronic symptom assessment and participant symptom reports alone) group participants. Secondarily, we explored the impact of participant adherence to clinician recommendations and additional self-management strategy use for SQIs on symptom control, symptom management satisfaction, and symptom distress. Lastly, we examined baseline predictors of participant adherence to clinician recommendations and additional self-management strategy use for SQIs. This study presents an analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Participants beginning a new chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen were recruited from oncology outpatient centers and were randomized to receive the ESRA-C intervention or control during treatment. Patients were included in this analysis if they remained on study through the duration of treatment and self-reported at least one bothersome SQI three-to-six weeks after beginning treatment. The Symptom Distress Scale-15 and Self-Management of SQIs Questionnaire were completed two weeks later. Based on Self-Management of SQIs Questionnaire ratings, participants were placed into adherence to clinician recommendations (adhered/did not adhere/did not receive recommendations) and additional self-management strategy use (yes/no) categories. Most participants were adherent to clinician recommendations (273/370, 73.8%), while fewer used additional self-management strategies for SQIs (182/370, 49.2%). There were no differences in the frequency of participant adherence to clinician recommendations (chi-square test, P=.99) or self-management strategy use (chi-square test, P=.80) between intervention (n=182) and control treatment groups (n=188). Participants who received clinician recommendations reported the highest treatment satisfaction (n=355, P<.001 by analysis of variance; ANOVA), although lowest distress was reported by participants who did not follow clinician recommendations (n=322, P=.04 by ANOVA) for top 2 SQIs. Women (n=188) reported greater additional self-management strategy use than men (n=182, P=0.03 by chi-square test).

Men with prostate cancer on ADT were recruited from one of two experienced Canadian centres and randomized 1:1:1 to PT, GROUP, or HOME. Randomization was stratified by length of ADT use and site.

The efficacy endpoints QOL, fatigue, and fitness (VO2 peak, grip strength, and timed chair stands) in GROUP and HOME were compared for non-inferiority to PT. Descriptive analyses were used for feasibility endpoints. Between-group differences for efficacy endpoints were examined using Bayesian linear mixed effects models. Fifty-nine participants (mean age 69.9 years) were enrolled. The recruitment rate was 25.4% and recruitment was slower than projected. Retention was 71.2%. Exercise adherence as measured through attendance was high for supervised sessions but under 50% by self-report and accelerometry. Satisfaction was high and there was no difference in this measure between all three groups. Between-group differences (comparing both GROUP and HOME to PT) were smaller than the minimum clinically important difference on most measures of QOL, fatigue, and fitness. However, two of six outcomes for GROUP and four of six outcomes for HOME had a > 20% probability of being inferior for GROUP. Feasibility endpoints were generally met.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a home-based, self-managed, moderate intensity walking intervention on subjective and objective cognitive functioning in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A home-based, self-managed intervention that consisted of moderate levels of walking was compared to usual care among breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy in a randomised controlled trial. Outcome measures included changes in subjective (CFQ) and objectively detected cognitive functioning (Stroop, SART and two subscales from the WAIS- Digit Span and Block Design). Fifty participants were randomised to either the intervention group (n = 25), who completed 12 weeks of moderate intensity walking, or to the control group (n = 25) mid-way through chemotherapy. Compared with the control group, the self-managed walking intervention had positive effects on perceived cognitive function but not on sustained attention, executive function, memory or visual spatial skills when assessed objectively using neuropsychological measures. This home-based, self-managed intervention is beneficial for protecting against perceived cognitive decline in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.

Comparison between interventions showed larger decreased arm volume of 140mL (95%CI 17-263) immediately after intervention in favor of the Ai Chi intervention, however it was not sustained at 1h follow-up. A post hoc analysis showed 72% of participants had a decrease in arm volume immediately after Ai Chi compared to 28% immediately after conventional aquatic therapy; with a number needed to treat of 3 (95%CI 1.4-6.6).

The primary objective of our trial is to determine the proportion of eligible patients randomized in an 18-month period. The primary feasibility outcome will be to (1) stop, main study not feasible: estimated proportion of randomized patients <40.0% (40/100); (2) continue with protocol modifications: estimated proportion of randomized patients 40.0% (40/100) to 59.0% (50/100); or (3) continue without modification: estimated proportion of randomized patients \u226560.0% (60/100). The secondary objectives are to evaluate compliance with the nutritional supplements and to estimate differences in postoperative complications, global health-related quality of life (QoL), and median length of hospital stay between the groups. This is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled feasibility trial. The intervention comprises three nutritional supplements: a protein isolate powder (ISOlution); immunomodulation (INergy-FLD), formulated liquid diet; and carbohydrate loading (PreCovery). Patients will consume 1 serving of the protein supplement per day from the randomization time up to 6 days before surgery (30 days in total). The immunomodulation, a solution that contains arginine, protein isolate, omega-6 fatty acids, and RNA, aims to attenuate excessive inflammatory responses and to replenish nutrients. This solution will be consumed as 3 doses per day for 5 days before and after surgery. Carbohydrate loading helps to reduce the stress from surgery by decreasing insulin resistance. Patients will have 2 servings the evening before surgery and 1 serving 2-3 hours before surgery. To be eligible, patients must have a resectable gastrointestinal cancer for which an elective operation is planned. Patients will be stratified according to nutritional status. The operation should occur within 4 weeks from enrollment. We expect to screen 165 eligible patients; 60.6% (100/165) of them will be randomized to either intervention or placebo.

In this single-blind clinical trial, 53 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned into three groups: honey mouthwash (n = 17), oral care (n = 17), and control (n = 19). The severity of mucositis and weights was examined blindly at the baseline and 4-week follow-up. The prevalence of grades of mucositis in the study groups was significant at the end of the third (p = 0.002) and fourth (p < 0.001) weeks. The mucositis severity decreased at the end of the third and fourth weeks in the honey mouthwash group (p < 0.05), whereas it increased in the control group (p < 0.001). The difference in the weight was significant between the honey mouthwash and the control groups (p < 0.05, MD = 1.95) at the end of the third week, and between the honey mouthwash group with the control (p < 0.01, MD = 2.92) and oral care groups (p < 0.05, MD = 1.95) at the end of the fourth week. Honey mouthwash is effective in preventing and reducing the severity of mucositis, and weight loss and can be recommended for patients undergoing chemotherapy. The results of this study suggest that honey mouthwash can reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis in patients, reduce or eliminate the possibility of weight loss in them, as well as encourage some weight gain. Compared to routine oral care, honey mouthwash is also easier to use and handle.

To investigate whether prehabilitation is effective in improving functional status in patients undergoing esophagogastric cancer resection. A randomized clinical trial (available-case analysis based on completed assessments) was conducted at McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) comparing prehabilitation with a control group. Intervention consisted of preoperative exercise and nutrition optimization. Participants were adults awaiting elective esophagogastric resection for cancer. The study dates were February 13, 2013, to February 10, 2017. The primary outcome was change in functional capacity, measured with absolute change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). Preoperative (end of the prehabilitation period) and postoperative (from 4 to 8 weeks after surgery) data were compared between groups. Sixty-eight patients were randomized, and 51 were included in the primary analysis. The control group were a mean (SD) age, 68.0 (11.6) years and 20 (80%) men. Patients in the prehabilitation group were a mean (SD) age, 67.3 (7.4) years and 18 (69%) men.

Rigorous research is needed on practical, cost-effective interventions that address environmental as well as personal determinants of F&V intake. This paper presents the results of a cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of 'Live Well, Viva Bien' (LWVB), a multicomponent intervention that included discount, mobile fresh F&V markets in conjunction with nutrition education. Fifteen subsidized housing sites in Providence County, Rhode Island (8 intervention and 7 control sites) were randomized using a random number generator. Of these, nine housed elderly and/or disabled residents and six housed families. A total of 1597 adult housing site residents (treatment n = 837; control n = 760) were enrolled (73% women, 54% Hispanic, 17% black, Mean age 54 years). A year-long multicomponent intervention including mobile F&V markets plus nutrition education (e.g. campaigns, DVDs, newsletters, recipes, and chef demonstrations) was implemented at intervention sites. Physical activity and stress interventions were implemented at control sites. Follow-up occurred at 6 and 12 months. The main outcome measure was F&V consumption measured by National Cancer Institute's 'Eating at America's Table All Day Screener'. From baseline to 12 months, the intervention group increased total F&V intake by 0.44 cups with the control group decreasing intake by 0.08 cups (p < .02). Results also showed an increased frequency of F&V eating behaviors compared to the control group (p < .01). There was a clear dose response effect of the F&V markets with participants who reported attending all or most of the markets increasing F&V intake by 2.1 cups and 0.86 cups, respectively compared with less than half cup increases for lower levels of market attendance (p < .05). Use of the DVDs, recipes and taste-testings was also associated with greater increases in F&V intake; however, use of other educational components was not. LWVB is the first cluster, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of year-round F&V markets on improving F&V intake for low-income adults, which provides an evidence-base to bolster the mission of mobile produce markets. Further, the results more broadly support investment in environmental changes to alleviate disparities in F&V consumption and diet-related health inequities.

People with cancer and malnutrition have a greater risk of morbidity and mortality. Nutrition intervention is recommended to commence immediately in those who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. Novel cost-effective approaches that can deliver early, pre-hospital nutrition intervention before usual hospital dietetic service is commenced are needed. Linking clinicians and patients via mobile health (mHealth) and wireless technologies is a contemporary solution not yet tested for delivery of nutrition therapy to people with cancer. The aim of this study is to commence nutrition intervention earlier than usual care and evaluate the effects of using the telephone or mHealth for intervention delivery. It is hypothesised that participants allocated to receive the early and intensive pre-hospital dietetic service will have more quality-adjusted life years lived compared with control participants. This study will also demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of mHealth for the nutrition management of patients at home undergoing cancer treatment. This study is a prospective three-group randomised controlled trial, with a concurrent economic evaluation. The 18 week intervention is provided in addition to usual care and is delivered by two different modes, via telephone (group 1) or via mHealth (group 2), The control group receives usual care alone (group 3).

We will compare the DA in combination with a brief Q&A session with a genetic counsellor to genetic counselling alone in a mixed-methods randomised controlled trial. Patients who received negative standard cancer genetic results for their personal and family history of cancer and are thus eligible for sequencing will be recruited from cancer genetics clinics in Toronto. Our primary outcome is decisional conflict. Secondary outcomes are knowledge, satisfaction, preparation for decision-making, anxiety and length of session with the genetic counsellor. A subset of participants will complete a qualitative interview about preferences for incidental results. This study has been approved by research ethics boards of St. Michael's Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. This research poses no significant risk to participants. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a novel patient-centred tool to support clinical delivery of incidental results. Results will be shared through national and international conferences, and at a stakeholder workshop to develop a consensus statement to optimise implementation of the DA in practice.

This paper reports countywide adoption, reach, and effectiveness from the Faith, Activity, and Nutrition dissemination and implementation study. This was a group-randomized trial. Data were collected in 2016. Statistical analyses were conducted in 2017. Churches in a rural, medically underserved county in South Carolina were invited to enroll, and attendees of enrolled churches were invited to complete questionnaires (n=1,308 participated). Churches (n=59) were randomized to an intervention or control (delayed intervention) condition. Church committees attended training focused on creating opportunities, setting guidelines/policies, sharing messages, and engaging pastors for physical activity (PA) and healthy eating (HE). Churches also received 12 months of telephone-based technical assistance. Community health advisors provided the training and technical assistance. The Reach, Efficacy/Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework guided measurement of adoption and reach. To assess effectiveness, church attendees completed post-test only questionnaires of perceptions of church environment, PA and fruit and vegetable (FV) self-efficacy, FV intake, and PA. Regression models controlled for church clustering and predominant race of congregation, as well as member age, gender, education, and self-reported cancer diagnosis. Church adoption was 42% (55/132). Estimated reach was 3,527, representing 42% of regular church attendees and 15% of county residents. Intervention church attendees reported greater church-level PA opportunities, PA and HE messages, and PA and HE pastor support (p<0.0001), but not FV opportunities (p=0.07). PA self-efficacy (p=0.07) and FV self-efficacy (p=0.21) were not significantly higher in attendees of intervention versus control churches. The proportion of inactive attendees was lower in intervention versus control churches (p=0.02). The proportion meeting FV (p=0.27) and PA guidelines (p=0.32) did not differ by group. This innovative dissemination and implementation study had high adoption and reach with favorable environmental impacts, positioning it for broader dissemination.

Previous studies have suggested that fear of a cancer recurrence is clinically relevant in this group of patients and, if not addressed, can lead to distress. Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression among various groups of cancer patients. Online mindfulness-based interventions have the potential to reach people unable to attend face-to-face interventions due to limitations such as cancer-related illness, transportation or time constraints. This study aims to (1) examine whether individuals with a melanoma diagnosis are willing to participate and adhere to a 6-week online mindfulness-based intervention and (2) explore potential benefits of the program on fear of cancer recurrence, worries, rumination, perceived stress and trait mindfulness to inform the design of a clinical trial. This is a single-site randomised controlled trial of a feasibility study. Seventy-five participants with stage 2c or 3 melanoma will be recruited from a melanoma outpatient clinic and randomised (2:1) either to an online mindfulness-based program (intervention) or to usual care (control). The intervention is a 6-week program specifically developed for this study. It consists of videos describing the concept of mindfulness, short daily guided meditation practices (5-10 min), automated meditation reminders and instructions for applying mindfulness in daily life to enhance wellbeing. All participants will complete questionnaires at baseline and at 6-week post-randomisation. Participants in the control group will be given access to the online program at the end of the study. Primary outcomes are overall recruitment; retention; extent of questionnaire completion; and usability and acceptability of, and adherence to, the program. The secondary outcomes are fear of cancer recurrence, worries, rumination, perceived stress and trait mindfulness measured using validated instruments. This feasibility study will evaluate participants' satisfaction with the program and identify barriers to recruitment and adherence. The recruitment and data collection process will highlight methodological aspects to address in the planning of a larger scale study assessing the impact of an online mindfulness-based intervention on fear of cancer recurrence and wellbeing.

Despite the substantial resources involved in providing these programmes, there is evidence that routine follow-up programmes do not affect survival or the likelihood of detecting recurrence and may not meet patient needs. Alternative follow-up modalities may offer the same outcomes at lower cost. We examined the costs of using telephone-based routine follow-up of women treated for endometrial cancer undertaken by specialist gynaecology oncology nurses in comparison to routine hospital-based follow-up. The ENDCAT trial randomised 259 women at five centres in the north west of England with a known diagnosis of Stage I endometrial cancer who had completed primary treatment on a 1:1 basis to receive either standard hospital outpatient follow-up or a telephone follow-up intervention administered by specialist nurses. A cost-consequence analysis was undertaken in which we compared costs to the health system and to individuals with the trial's co-primary outcomes of psychological morbidity and participant satisfaction with information received. Psychological morbidity, psychosocial needs, patient satisfaction and quality of life did not differ between arms. Patients randomised to telephone follow-up underwent more and longer consultations. There was no difference in total health service mean per patient costs at 6 months (mean difference \u00a38, 95% percentile confidence interval: - \u00a3147 to \u00a3141) or 12 months (mean difference: - \u00a377, 95% percentile confidence interval: - \u00a3334 to \u00a3154). Estimated return journey costs per patient for hospital consultations were \u00a311.47. Productivity costs were approximately twice as high under hospital follow-up. Telephone follow-up was estimated to be cost-neutral for the NHS and may free up clinic time for other patients. There was some evidence that telephone follow-up may be more efficient for patients and wider society, and is not associated with additional psychological morbidity, lower patient satisfaction or reduced quality of life.

Current messaging focuses on HPV infection transmission and prevention. Parents and providers are often uncomfortable discussing sexual practices of adolescents, contributing to the delay/refusal of vaccine. We created a cervical cancer-salient message encouraging HPV vaccination, emphasizing disease salience and disease threat, while promoting self-efficacy. We hypothesized this message would have greater effects on vaccine confidence and intent to vaccinate compared to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and non-vaccine control messages. A 3-arm randomized trial was conducted. Parents of girls aged 9-17 were eligible for the study. We measured participants' vaccine confidence and intent to vaccinate at baseline and post intervention message. Recruitment and surveys were administered online through Amazon Mechanical Turk. 762 participants completed both surveys. We saw modest increases in vaccine confidence when comparing cervical cancer arm and control arm, and CDC arm and control arm; estimates were not statistically significant. The odds of reporting intent to vaccinate among the cervical cancer message arm were 1.13 times the odds of reporting intent to vaccinate in the control arm (95% CI: 0.30. 4.29). Intent to vaccinate was also not statistically significantly different between CDC message arm and control arm (OR=1.25, 95%CI: 0.66, 2.37). Neither message had effect on intent to vaccinate, highlighting need for research to identify successful messaging strategies for HPV. Exploratory analyses suggest among parents with 'Low' vaccine confidence at baseline, the cervical cancer framed message may be more effective in changing intention than the CDC message or non-vaccine control. Future work should target groups with 'Low' or 'Medium' vaccine confidence at baseline - they may be more amenable to change, and more receptive to disease-salient messaging.

Over 3years, we will recruit 312 consenting participants on Denver Urban Gardens' waitlists and randomize them to garden or remain on the waitlist. At baseline (pre-gardening), harvest time, and post-intervention, study participants will complete three 24-hour dietary recalls, a 7-day activity monitoring period using accelerometry, a health interview and physical anthropometry. This project addresses health-promoting behaviors among a multi-ethnic, mixed-income adult population in a large metropolitan area.
